The first way described to run the tests should be:    java -jar dom1-core.jar    Which will run all tests in two modes on the default JAXP parser and print  results to the console.    The "TestXerces" and other classes are JUnit specific and therefore are  located in junit-run.jar.  JUnit's GUIs don't populate the combo box (at  least for us), but do remember previous entries.    I haven't seem that message before, it would indicate that the class was  loaded, but the suite method doesn't exist which should not be the case.  Any more diagnosis you could provide would be appreciated.    >  >  > Copyight: (s/Copyight/Copyright)  >  > please provide a link to  > http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720  > a copy of this file in the package?
