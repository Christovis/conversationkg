      Hello all,    The Web Standards Project is soliciting Web design "war stories" from the  public. Have you been stuck designing a Web site for a client that had to  be a certain way in all browsers? Did you end up spending countless hours  creating workarounds for the areas that weren't standards compliant? I know  this is especially an issue with making sites accessible- I've recently  started consulting on accessibility myself. Full support by both browsers  of CSS-2 positioning schemes may allow designers to stop using tables for  purposes of layout.    Come tell us your horror story.    http://www.webstandards.org/warstories/index.html  --  B.K.

      Hi all,    This event also has a Web Accessibility speaker.  ----    The Web Standards Project will hold a "Birds of a Feather" gathering during  Miller Freeman's Web '98 conference to promote Web developer and public  support  for encouraging browser makers to fully comply with standards created by the  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards bodies.    The event, sponsored by C|Net Builder.com, is scheduled for Wednesday,  September 23rd from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. in room 104 of the Hynes Convention  Center.    WaSP speakers include Steve Champeon, Senior Technical Consultant and  Vice-President,     hesketh.com/inc. Champeon will be discussing the project's  goals -- to eliminate the wasted time and effort working around browser  incompatibilities and to stop the fragmentation of the Web by persuading the  browser makers that common standards are in everyone's best interest.    Champeon will also provide updates on the progress that's been made so far.  WaSP's launch last month drew worldwide attention to the problems caused by  the  current patchwork support for standards, which the group estimates adds 25  percent to the cost of developing sites.    To fix these problems, WaSP is urging browser makers to fully support  Cascading  Style Sheet 1 (CSS-1), the Document Object Model (DOM) and XML in their 5.0  browsers.    Also speaking at this event will be Harvey Bingham, a Web Accessibility  Consultant.  Bingham is working with the Yuri Rubinsky Insight Foundation and  sits on several working groups for the World Wide Web Consortium?s Web  Accessibility Initiative. He will be introducing the W3C?s draft of page  authoring guidelines whose purpose is to help Web developers make their sites  more accessible by all.    "It's time for the browsers to start fully supporting World Wide Web  Consortium  (W3C) core standards -- standards that Microsoft and Netscape helped develop  and promised to support -- so that people building Web sites can spend more  time building better sites and less time fighting browsers over compatibility  issues that create unneeded expenses for everyone, at every level of the Web,"  said WSP co-founder, Glenn Davis, Chief Technology Officer of Project Cool,  Inc., a Palo Alto-based educational resource center for Web development.      This will be the first in a series of trade show events to bring together Web  developers and the Web-using public in order to raise awareness about the  problems caused by the current patchwork support for standards.    This event is open to the public.    --  B.K.

      After reading the CSS-2 spec, I've realized that the positioning schemes  contained within, formerly known as CSS-P, is God's gift to Web designers.  Currently, many of us have to use tables for layout. It's not a matter of  what we want, but it's a matter of what our clients want. Being able to  stop using tables in favor of CSS-2 means Web sites will become extremely  accessible.    Perhaps we should make it known to NS and MS how important this is.  --  B.K.

Just take what they say  >with a grain of salt <smile>    I've often found that putting pressure on the product managers often has a  trickle effect. It can go all the way up to top management. Often times the  engineers and programers want to implement features such as full HTML 4.0  or CSS-1 compliance but management tends to not care so much about features  as getting the product out on-schedule. That's where users come in....if  the customer-base applies the right pressure, things can change.  --  B.K.

      This may be being discussed in User Agent but has anyone thought to develop  a Web Accessibility test suite? As mentioned previously, the Mozilla team  is working hard to implement things like the TITLE, ACCESSKEY, and TABINDEX  attributes as well as elements like OPTGROUP, FIELDSET, and LEGEND. But  they have no real basis for what they should look like. I'd like to suggest  we take all of the accessibility issues mentioned in:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/HTML4-access    and create a test suite. I will volunteer to create the pages but I need  two bits of information:    1) What the function of each attribute/element is. For instance, the  FIELDSET element draws a box around a set of FORM fields and the LEGEND  child element is the label imbedded at the start of the box's border.     2) What, if any, browsers implement these attributes/elements correctly.  For example, the above mentioned elements are rendered correctly in IE5b2.    Please let me know what you think. Microsoft is starting to mention to  various people that they are "freezing" the code for IE5b2 which means any  feedback on bugs will soon be cut out of the next version. Netscape is  working hard on implementing full HTML 4.0 but needs guidance on how  certain attributes/elements should be implemented. Basically, I want to do  this ASAP if I do this at all.  --  B.K.

You have a valid point however what about people who use "spacer" Gifs for  layout. There is one authoring tool that actually creates tons of little,  invisible GIFs in order to position things where people want them. What  you're suggesting would be completely ineffective under these circumstances  as well as many others.    Besides an authoring tool that offers a preview of the page should also  have a toggle that allows you to preview it with graphics turned off or in  text-only mode.  --  B.K.

      Does anyone know who I should talk to regarding how certain HTML tags and  attributes function? For instance, Netscape says they've managed to get  LONGDESC to function in their latest build of NGLAYOUT. However....they  don't know how it should be implemented. They know it's supposed to be a  URI but what happeneds if someone has a graphic that links somewhere else  but also has a longdesc attribute?    They allow the public to contribute to bug reports and I want to make sure  all of this gets covered.    Thanks.  --  B.K.

      Hi all,    I've been talking with the guys working on Netscape's Gecko about  implementing the acessibility features of HTML 4.0 and they are aiming for  100% HTML 4.0 implementation. Has anyone started playing with Gecko to see  if they've implemented any of the below items?    To be fully Web accessible, NS 5.0 needs implementation of TITLE, LONGDESC,  ACCESSKEY, TABINDEX attributes, the MEDIA attribute of the LINK element,  the SUMMARY attribute of the TABLE element, the LABEL, ABBR, ACRONYM, Q,  INS, DEL, FIELDSET, LEGEND,  OPTGROUP, THEAD, TBODY, TFOOT, COLGROUP, and  COL elements as well as the ability to include A elements within the MAP  element of a client-side imagemap.    On the same note, Microsoft has been pretty good about how accessible their  products are but has anyone tested IEb2 to see if they've updated the  browser to have full implementation of HTML 4.0's accessibility features?  Here's what they were missing as of IE4.0:    LONGDESC attribute, ACCESSKEY attribute for the AREA and LEGEND elements,  MEDIA attribute for the LINK element, SUMMARY attribute of the TABLE  element, the ABBR, OPTGROUP elements.... and I haven't tested whether the  IE 4.0 implementation of the MAP element can have A elements within  it...but it's worth a check.  We've been told that IF they aren't  implemented, you can e-mail wasp@microsoft.com to let them know.    We finally have a chance to have full accessibility features in HTML 4.0  implemented in both of the big browsers. We should take advantage of this.    --  B.K.

      Keep this hush-hush until it's announced tommorrow.    Well, the Web development community is not going to be happy with IE5, due  out tommorrow. The Steering Committee of the Web Standards Project,  (http://www.webstandards.org) received all of our review copies of the IE5  release last week and have started testing their implementations of HTML  4.0, CSS-1, DOM Level 1, XML and other recommendations that have come out  since IE4. I'm sorry to say that their effort has been less than satisfactory.    I've been the member working on examining the HTML 4.0 implementation and  speaking for myself, there are STILL problems in it. CSS-1 has few  improvements but not enough to really let Webmasters make full use of it  and DOM Level 1 and XML support is reportedly horrendous.    I've created a partial HTML Test Suite to examine the HTML 4.0 rec. and  will have more detailed information to tell you tommorrow. For now, don't  let this e-mail leave the group.    Thanks.  --  B.K.

This  is the Web developer community's way of telling Microsoft what standards  are not implemented in IE5 and currently are not working in the beta. I  have a list of Accessibility tags not implemented in IE4 that I need help  checking in IE5 but don't exactally know what they're supposed to do.  Can you help?

      Hi all,    I just got off the phone with Eric Byunn, Navigator's project manager and  he said they are committed to supporting 100% all of the CSS-1 and HTML 4.0  recommendation. He was especially interested to hear that no one supported  some of the features that made HTML 4.0 Web accessible.     Please send me e-mails of tags that do not work and try to make up test  pages to show what the page SHOULD be doing. (Things like LONGDESC etc.)    Be in touch.  --  B.K.

      Hi everyone,    Thought I would invite you to our first event dedicated to Web  Accessibility. Hope to see you there:    An event sponsored by Miller Freeman and featuring the topic of Web  Accessibility, will be presented on Wednesday, September 23rd, 1998 in room  108 of the Hynes Convention Center from 1p.m. - 3p.m. The New England  Chapter of the World Organization of Webmasters will host the event. Bruce  Alexander, Chairman of WOW's Web Accessibility SIG, will serve as moderator.     The World Wide Web offers the promise of transforming many traditional  barriers to information and interaction among different peoples.  Therefore  it?s important to lead the Web to its full potential including promoting a  high degree of usability for people with disabilities. Several initiatives  are pursuing accessibility of the Web through five primary areas of work:  technology, guidelines, tools, education & outreach, and research &  development.    Speakers at the event include the head of the W3C Web Accessibility  Initiative, Judy Brewer. She coordinates five activities with respect to  Web accessibility: data formats and protocols; guidelines for browsers,  authoring tools and content creators; rating and certification tools;  education and outreach; and research and advanced development.     Prior to joining W3C, Judy was Project Director for the Massachusetts  Assistive Technology Partnership, a U.S. federally-funded project promoting  access to assistive technology for people with disabilities. Judy has a  background in applied linguistics, education, technical writing, management  and disability advocacy. Brewer will discuss the various projects the  initiative has been working on including a draft of page authoring  guidelines. The guidelines will help Web developers insure their site?s  accessibility.    Also speaking will be Joseph Lazzaro, project director of the Adaptive  Technology Program housed at the Massachusetts Commission For The Blind in  Boston, and author of "Adapting PC's for Disabilities", Addison-Wesley  Publishing Company. His published articles have appeared in Byte, Time  Life, the New York Times, Computer Shopper, and other industry trade  magazines.    Lazzaro will focus on the power and pitfalls experienced by persons with  vision impairments when surfing the World Wide Web. He?ll briefly describe  the basic technologies employed by persons with vision impairments: speech  synthesis, screen magnification, and Braille displays and will describe how  these basic technologies can be used to read web pages using both text and  graphical browsers.    Also speaking will be a representative from Microsoft Corporation who will  discuss their efforts to make Internet Explorer more accessible to the Web  browsing public.    This event is open to the public. Afterwards, attendees may be interested  in browsing through the Web ?98 Exposition. A free pass to the Expo can be  gotten by registering online at  https://www.exporeg.com/Shows/WebEast/expo1.htm    Be sure to register now because registering for the Expo on-site will cost  $50.    This event is open to the public- free for members and $15 for non-members.     --  B.K.

While Microsoft does tout their accessibility quite loudly and publically, Kynn  does have a good point. You can get a heck of a lot more out of an organization  like Microsoft by saying "Great job! Have you thought about this?" than  criticizing this: "Your sorry attempt at making your front page accessible  isn't worth it.....try following the standards that you participated in  creating."    Through my own personal experience, I've realized that use of the "blistering  criticism" that Kynn mentioned only causes Microsoft to get defensive. However,  they did make an interesting quote in the media last week:    > '"Standards support is important to a smaller subset of customers," said   > Jodi Ropert, group product manager for Microsoft's Macintosh business unit.   > "There are more universal needs from a performance and ease-of-use   > perspective."

I'm inclined to agree but one of the problems I am dealing with regarding  MS FrontPage's implementation of ALT attributes and the Mozilla group's  implementation of various HTML elements and attributes in the new layout  engine for NN 5.0 is that without some sort of SUGGESTION or guidance  regarding the optimal way to implement this will lead the project team to  pick some random means to display an element. This can lead to serious  problems when the product is released all because that contact between  recommendation editor and product manager has not been made.    I also suggested a "warning" box pop up if a user uses a "blank" ALT attribute:    > Perhaps when the user chooses a null option ALT attribute, a prompt will  say "Are you   >sure? People who use text-browsers, have images turned off, or visually   >impared users using screen readers will not be able to see this image."    What are your thoughts on that?   --  B.K.

      Hi all,    There's a great opportunity to let Netscape know that you want want their  5.0 browser to be W3C compliant-    The Web Standards Project, an international coalition of leading Web  developers and Web experts,  today launched a public campaign to encourage  Netscape to make sure its next version of Navigator includes software that  would reportedly make the browser 100 percent compliant with two major Web  standards.    WSP is gathering signatures from Web developers and the Web-using public,  via its site <http://www.webstandards.org>, urging Netscape to include its  NGLayout engine, which is currently under development, in Navigator 5.0.  The layout engine takes HTML and other code describing a Web page's  appearance and converts it into what the user actually sees.     Currently, layout engines in both Navigator and Microsoft's Internet  Explorer fail to fully support standards created by the World Wide Web  Consortium (W3C) and other standards bodies. The resulting  incompatibilities among various browsers add at least 25 percent to the  cost of building sites and threaten to fragment the Web.    Netscape officials have pledged NGLayout will fully support the standards  for Document Object Model (DOM) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) level 1  and also support features of the CSS level 2 standard. WSP has been urging  browser makers to fully support these core standards - as well as others,  such as XML - developed by the W3C and other standards bodies.    CSS gives control over the appearance of many pages at once, from the  typography to the behavior of links, as well as precise control over page  layout. DOM lets developers use scripting languages, such as ECMAScript  (n?e JavaScript), to manipulate text, images and other parts of Web pages;  for instance, dynamically changing their appearance over time, or moving  them around inside the browser window.    However, Netscape officials have said that current plans won't include  NGLayout in Navigator 5.0, scheduled for release later this year.  The "I  Want My NGLayout!" campaign is intended to let Netscape know that Web  developers and the Web-using public believe full support for these  standards by browsers is crucial for the evolution of the Web.

That's fine. One of the things the Web Standards Project is doing to make  it easier for genuine Web developers and designers get in touch with the  product teams of the browser companies, is to work with the companies to  create an e-mail address where Web developers can post information about  improvements they desire or bugs they run across. At Microsoft, this is  wasp@microsoft.com; with Netscape we have several avenues through the Gecko  project. Maybe this would be a good idea.

There is talk about designing a standard Web browser that completely  matches W3C standards. Doing this will hopefully show the Web community  that it can be done and put MS and NS to shame in the process.....hopefully  causing them to revamp their own browsers in the process.

I cannot agree more with what you said. By harping on these two issue we  would be limiting the amount of accessibility we could recommend authoring  tools contain or produce. Especially if we use the excuse "no one will  implement it due to the cost incurred."     Besides, concerned individuals will always step in to help with the  enforcement of standards. Look at the Web Standards Project. They've taken  CSS 1 and HTML 4.0 and made the Web development community aware of how  unimplemented these recommendations are. Currently, Netscape is rewriting  their browser to become as compliant as possible and Microsoft has even  admitted it now recognizes Web developers as a potential client and user.    We should not limit ourselves because we think our recommendations will  interfere with a company's cost or product-to-market schedule. If the  companies do not implement our AU Recommendations, a new group will spring  up to educate the public to ask for those features or buy a different product.  --  B.K.

That's a job for a different organization. The Web Standards Project was  set up specifically to go after browser makers and not Web designers and  developers. The browser copanies keep us busy as it is.     >Which ultimately hurts accessibility -- it's hard to get people  >to code properly accessible HTML if they're unwilling to code  >valid HTML at all.     The purpose of going after the browser companies is because currently  designing to standards is extremely limiting because of the poor support on  behalf of the browsers. Anyway, the way to get them to want to design using  valid HTML is not to chastize them for their choice of HTML and make them  feel stupid but to help them understand nicely why it's the right thing.  The government will then sock Title II and II organizations with ADA  requirements to do so.    On the other hand, most designers don't code by hand. They use authoring  tools. So really, someone should be going after authoring tool companies to  make sure they use techniques that create valid HTML.    >I'm sadded that the WSP has chosen to  >vocally declare that web authors should NOT worry about  >following web standards.

      This probably isn't our responsibility but I was doing some research on  blindness statistics and came across the Web site for the organization  "Research to Prevent Blindness." While it may be argued that the  organization is working to prevent blindness and not work with people  already visually impaired, I ran their site through Bobby and found them to  be very inaccessible - (no ALT attributes, use of frames and tables for  layout etc.). What is WAI EOs stance when coming across sites like this?  Should we actively approach the organization and mention the  inaccessibility of their site?  --  B.K.

      Very interesting sentiments, Kynn. I spent a good portion of last week  sitting at a booth at Web '98. I coordinated, planed, and managed an event  for Web Accessibility and the Web Standards Project. If I let myself be  discouraged, I could easily be because we didn't have nearly as many people  as I had hoped at either event.    But, I managed to have Web Standards Project brochures at every  non-profit's booth (ACM, WOW, AIP, WITI, CPSR, and Webgrrls) as well as a  huge stack of W3C sheets talking about the Web Accessibility Initiative and  their Page Authoring Guidelines. When I'd feel my audience slipping from  our organization, I would jump in really quick about the other two efforts.    Every time I saw someone from an educational institution, government  organization, or military installation, I mentioned the 1996 US DOJ ruling  about how Web sites of public libraries, colleges and universities, state,  federal, or local government organizations AND- this one got them- almost  everyone who has a government contract need to be compliant with Title II  and III of the ADA, EVERYONE was interested. I ran out of information  sheets and people requested I e-mail them the URL for the page authoring  guidelines.    Plus, I explained to all other Web developers that the Page Authoring  Guidelines really go over how to make your Web site more accessible without  having to completely sacrifice design...or maintain a completely seperate  text page. When Web developers hear accessibility, they think work. If you  think about it, it really isn't. If you're Web site is HTML 4.0  compliant....then you're most of the way there to being Accessible.    Also, I think we should follow the good ideas of the Web Standards Project.  They are going after the "user agent" and "authoring tool" manufacturers,  having them make it so Web sites are more accessible. If we convince the  Web developing public that this is a good cause, (as the WSP has convinced  them.....), then they will fully support Web accessibility.    It's just a matter of figuring out how to push people's buttons and how to  get them going. Don't get discouraged. If people like you who are working  so hard for the cause lose faith....then so will everyone else. Keep up the  excellent work.  --  B.K.

This whole issue came up when I sent Kynn  Bartlett a copy of my powerpoint presentation that I am giving in 1/2 an  hour here at Builder.com Live. I am giving an overview of the "A" section  of the guidelines. Kynn went and looked through them on the Web and thus  saw it in its hugeness.    He has made some excellent points. People are not going to sit through  the guidelines, trying to learn every detail on their own. Perhaps  publishing these guidelines in some sort of book would be very helpful as  well.
