      The proposed say-before and say-after properties (I am using Al's names)  have my support as well. They are similar in design to my speakrow and  speakcell properties.    In connection with the latter, Al is correct in observing that the HEADER  variable in SPEAKCELL would require the user agent to be able to identify  the headers associated with the current cell (namely the cell which is to  be spoken). Given the HEADERS and SCOPE attributes in HTML, this  requirement should be easily satisfied. The only problem here is that the  solution would be somewhat HTML-specific and may not apply to other  structured document formats such as XML documents, at least without  software support from the user agent and appropriate markup constructs in  the DTD.
