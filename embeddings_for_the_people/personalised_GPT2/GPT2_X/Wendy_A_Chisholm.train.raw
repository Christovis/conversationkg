        Hello all,    Olivier created a "W3C Glossary and Dictionary Project" page at:   http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/01/Glossary    Please note that we'll have a WAI meeting on Friday of the technical   plenary (7 March) to discuss the WAI glossary.  For two hours of that day   we will join other groups interested in discussing a W3C-wide glossary.    Refer to the technical plenary page for more information about logistics of   the meeting and please register.  The discounted hotel rate expires 1   February.  http://www.w3.org/2002/10/allgroupoverview.html    I will post a more detailed agenda of the WAI glossary meeting asap.

      Jon,    I believe the statement "Clearly specify how content that is tailored   according to client or user capabilities may conform (dynamic content or   database driven)." applies to scripting issues.    This is found in the second section called "Ensure that the minimal   conformance requirements are clear"    If this does not cover your needs please be more specific.    --wendy    At 09:44 AM 4/20/00 , Jon Gunderson wrote:  >Wendy,  >There was no mention of scripting in the revised requirements document.  >Is scripting considered part of other specifications or is it not going to   >be in the scope of what the working group is going to work on?  >  >  >  >Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP  >Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology  >Chair, W3C WAI User Agent Working Group  >Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services  >College of Applied Life Studies  >University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign  >1207 S.

      Hello,    I started incorporating EO's suggestions into "Evaluation, Repair, and   Transform Tools for Web Content Accessibility" [1] (previously known as the   List of Existing Tools).    I have:  1. added a disclaimer  2. added brief descriptions about each type of tool in the table of contents.  3. alphabetized the tools in each list.  4. updated the "last modified date" and copyright (it had been modified in   February 2000, but the date had been hard-coded. this is now automagically   generated).  5. added a brief introduction    There are still many tools without information since I have not finished   reviewing all of the tools.  Could we divide the remaining tools into a few   sublists for people to review?  Any volunteers?  Suggestions for how to   break this up?  If we could get a handful of people each reviewing one tool   per week we could have this updated in a few weeks....which would be really   groovy. <grin>    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        On 27 June, I met with several people from the WWAAC.  http://212.187.34.208/wwaac/  Doeko Hekstra - Handicom  Mike Clarke, Andrew Lysley, Mark Saville, David Colven - ACE Centre   Advisory Trust  Colette Nicolle - Loughborough University  Bengt Farre - Femtio Procent Data    I took an action to outline issues and follow-up with several W3C folks.  My outline is at:  http://www.w3.org/2002/07/03-symbolAnnotation.html    Here is a brief trip report:  They gave me an update of the WWAAC progress (http://www.wwaac.org/), a  demonstration of the browser they are developing, and discussed a mock-up  of future directions for development.    We talked quite a lot about using images to annotate content.  I took an  action to write-up my ideas and discuss with the Annotea folk.  As well as  put the WWAAC and Annotea folk in touch w/each other.    As part of their project, they are supposed to write guidelines for  developing an AAC-enabled WWW.  They will be sending at least one person to   the WCAG  F2F in Linz 15/16 July.  It seems that we are moving towards a general  guideline about writing simply and plainly, but have techniques for folks  who want to create content specific for people with cognitive  disabilities.  We will have a group of people at the Linz meeting to  discuss this.  We're planning to approach it from the techniques  perspective at the meeting.  Others who are registered to attend to  participate in this topic discussion:  Avi Arditti (Voice of America and Plain English Network)  Jonathan Chetwynd  + Bengt from WWAAC.    They want to standardize concept codes as a way to easily translate between  symbol languages.  e.g. bliss has one symbol for cat, but  another symbol  language uses a different symbol.  We discussed using WordNet as a catalog  of concept codes, but we need to look into how English-specific it is.    We discussed the possibility of creating a symbol-based style sheet for an  XML file as well as content negotiation for symbols.    They gave me an install of "Symbol for Windows" to demonstrate the issues  and solutions.    They were well prepared and circulated a couple of documents in  preparation for the meeting.  1. Guidelines for Developing an AAC-Enable WWW (a discussion document)  2. WWAAC Code of Practice (in 2 parts)  - Exchanging information over the Internet through Concept Coding  - Improving accessibility of web-based information and services for persons  with limited cognitive, language, and/or motor skills    The first, went through WCAG 2.0 and raised good research questions as  possible future directions for their group.  They were trying to make sense  of how they could contribute. I think we found many connection points -  primarily in review and documentation of techniques.    The second, described an XML syntax to markup concept codes.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Using the world meeting planner [1] for London, Tokyo, and New York   it seems the best time to meet next week would be:  UTC: Wednesday February 20, 2002 at 12:00 PM   New York: Wed 7:00 AM   Tokyo: Wed 9:00 PM    How does that work for everyone?    Nick, this doesn't meet your requirement for after 6 p.m. UTC.  Could we try it this once?   Masaya, this is out of the standard working day for you.  If this does not work for you, please let me know.    FYI, I'll be in Boston next week, so I don't mind 7 a.m., but once I get back to Seattle this would be 4 a.m. my time. Therefore, I am only proposing this time slot for this upcoming week.  I'd like to see us work out something that:  1. is not in the middle of the night for anyone who doesn't want it to be (Nick, Jim, and SBP are happy with midnight GMT)  2. is during a reasonable hour for Nadia to get to the office  3. is after 6 p.m. GMT so that Nick can save some money.    2 and 3 seem to be in direct conflict with each other. :\    Any ideas for future meetings?  --wendy    [1] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) [1] has   been working on the Techniques For Web Content Accessibility Guidelines   [2]. This document was last released as a W3C Note when the Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) [3] became a W3C Recommendation 5   May 1999. At that time the Techniques document was a single document. Over   the course of the last few months we have divided that document into 3   separate chapters:  Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0  HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0  CSS Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0    Together, these documents describe the techniques that Web content authors   (developers of Web sites) should use to conform to the WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.    The WCAG WG believes this document is ready to supercede the previous Note   that was published 5 May 1999 [4]. However, the group would like comments   from WAI IG before moving forward.    This document is published as a Note rather than going through the   Recommendation track because it is non-normative (it is informative rather   than normative). In other words, it provides information about how to   conform to a normative document.  In this case, the normative document is   WCAG 1.0.   We intend to update the techniques documents as new   technologies are introduced and as new techniques evolve. For example over   the course of the next several months the WCAG WG anticipates adding   chapters for SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language), SVG   (Scalable Vector Graphics), and for a few non-W3C technologies. We also   expect to add more HTML, CSS and scripting techniques to those that are   already included in these techniques documents. We are also discussing   clearer navigation mechanisms between the techniques documents, such as a   site map and a navigation side-bar similar to the new W3C home page.    However, there is the need to update the current Note with the advances we   have made thus far. Primarily, we have corrected some errors that existed   in the 5 May 1999 release and updated the Techniques per discussions in the   Working Group that have occurred since the release of WCAG 1.0.    We would appreciate any comments that you may have. This review period will   end Tuesday, August 15, 2000. Please send review comments before that date   to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org. Archives for this list are at   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/.    Thank you in advance,  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000727/  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Joe,    Please note that this [1] is a draft, it is not final and we are still  discussing it.  I have clarified this by adding the following disclaimer to  the beginning of the document: "This is a draft. This has not been approved   by the WCAG WG and is not operative. It is for discussion purposes   only.  Please send comments to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org."    At Wednesday's meeting we discussed that if someone had to attend both   the  techniques task force telecon *and* the WCAG WG telecon *and* keep up   on  the mailing list, the minimum 4 hours of time expected to contribute   (per our charter) would be eaten up without doing any real   work.  Therefore, it seems to make sense that a person could participate in   either the task force telecons or the WCAG WG telecons to be considered a   participant in good standing.  However, we want to make sure that we are   not running two separate groups.  The task force is not publishing its own   documents, it is working on documents for the WCAG WG.  Keeping the two   groups in synch is key and overlapping participation helps.    Our policies will not change overnight or without warning.  This is a draft   that was produced for discussion.  This is part of the transition to   adopting our new charter and the new process document and, in the near   future, adopting the new patent policy.  As part of this transition, other   aspects of our work will be discussed, better documented and revised.    --wendy    [1] <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/12/wttf.html>    At 01:41 PM 12/13/2003, Joe Clark wrote:      >I want WAI (read well: WAI) to be very, very clear about what it truly  >means here:  >  ><http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003OctDec/0556.html>  >  > > Work statement [1]: focused mainly on membership requirements for our task  > > force.

        Possible agenda topics:    1. How ATAG and WCAG reference each other.    2. Scope of the documents. Basically, ATAG covers the process of generating    the content and t thus includes Content Management Systems (CMS), authoring    tools, etc.  WCAG covers the end result of the authoring process (thus does    not cover CMS).    3. The suitability of requirements to use W3C recommendations.  ATAG 1.0    only discusses producing content for W3C formats.  WCAG 1.0 says only use    W3C formats.  How should the 2.0 versions of WCAG and ATAG reference W3C    technologies?  In WCAG 2.0 we currently have checkpoint 4.3 [1].      Other topics?

      Hello all,    I thought these notes might be helpful for others who are trying to   understand this week's issues.  These are the notes that I've taken for   myself to prepare for this week's meeting.    --wendy    --  7.4  <proposal>  8. Clarification of checkpoint 7.4  Added: xx August 2000  Type: Clarification  Refers to: Checkpoint 7.4 of 5 May 1999 version  Description (and correction): Checkpoint 7.4 says,  <blockquote>  Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not create   periodically auto-refreshing pages. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML,   don't cause pages to auto-refresh with "HTTP-EQUIV=refresh" until user   agents allow users to turn off the feature.  </blockquote>  This checkpoint is trying to address two issues:  1. Disorientation due to unexpected changes in content. Users should expect   changes in content when they follow a link or submit a form. However, the   author may cause unexpected changes to content by using scripts or other   markup. The author should inform the user of changes that will occur   without explicit user interaction.  For example, if pressing a submit button will cause an intermediate page to   appear before the final results are displayed, inform the user in advance.   In short, warn the user of what will happen without their explicit interaction.  2. Response time not long enough to interact or comprehend the content   before it changes. To ensure that users can interact with and understand   content in a time frame suitable to their needs, do not cause automatic   content changes at regular intervals (such as a page of stock quotes that   is updated every 3 minutes).  There is an "until user agents" clause that is not yet satisfied for this   checkpoint. Note that the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines will require   user agents to provide the ability for users to update pages manually.  </proposal>    Kynn raises a good point that all periodically refreshing pages are   outlawed by this checkpoint.  He creates a good example of how one could   create something that appears to be accessible.  I would like to get   feedback on a live example to see what people have to say. Send it to IG,   webwatch, access-l, etc. for review.    Al has raised issues with the user agent piece of this, primarily that   there is a misstatement about the UAAG requirement for manual updates and   that we ought to provide more info about user agents satisfying the "until   user agent" clause. i'm waiting for clarification on his suggestions.    ----  WCAG 2.0 organization    Ian proposed [1] that we have guidelines, checkpoints, and then several   technology-specific documents that provide a checklist for how to apply the   checkpoints to the specific technology (technology profiles).  The   Guidelines/checkpoints, and technology profiles are normative.  He also   suggested that to conform, one would "claim conformance to WCAG 2.0 for   HTML with a URI that designates this document." rather than to the   Guidelines/checkpoints.  Ian also states [2] that, "There is no requirement   at W3C that a Recommendation have conformance provisions, so we can publish   a set of fairly abstract principles that can be the basis for later   technology specific profiles."    Rob asks if there will be a "master compliance matrix between the WCAG,   User Agent, Page Authoring and what else are we missing" to be used by   people to record compliance testing that could be posted to the web as a   rating sheet. [3] I've asked him to clarify how this would look and who   would fill it out.    Jason is concerned that Ian's proposal would not scale as new technologies   are developed.  [4]  How would one conform to WCAG if they are using a   technology that does not have a WCAG profile?    Jason is also concerned that we have a variety of audiences and goals and   that we need to keep all of this in mind as we move forward. [5]    Matt suggests [6]:  - a list of general principles (Recommendation)  - technology-specific checkpoints (Note)  - conformance is based on the tech-specific checkpoints where they exist,   and on the general checkpoints where they do not.  Backing up his argument with the following statement: In the absence of a   spec for everything under the sun, requiring conformance with the   higher-level rules seems like a fair compromise.    Charles backs up Matt's proposal by saying that the current organization   that exists (WCAG 1.0, ATAG 1.0) doesn't seem broken, so let's reuse it. [7]    Kynn suggests that Markup Language Accessibility Guidelines be a separate   document and not something we try to tackle with WCAG 2.0.

[1]  Dave Pawson seems to support, also offers a suggestion for how to extend   the proposal to make it more useful. [2]  William writes (in a different thread) that an important principle has been   identified but he can't express it. [3]  Sighted users use the visual   distinctions created by using class to format elements to quickly skim a   document, users who are blind do not have this advantage (core of Len's   proposal).

      Hello,    The request for review was sent to IG last night.    Note that it does not   include the non-w3c technologies chapter.  We had not yet communicated with   Macromedia about the information we provided about Flash and thus will   delay publishing this chapter.  The CSS, HTML, and general chapters were   published in their entirety.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2000/12/11-minutes.html    Minutes from 11 December 2000 ERT WG telecon  Participants  ?       Chris Ridpath  ?       Michael Cooper  ?       Dick Brown  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Sharon Laskowski  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Harvey Bingham    Regrets  ?       Sean Palmer    Update from F2F  LK I'm reconstructing notes from my palm pilot. MOral of the story: don't   replace batteries on a crowded convention floor. The bottom line is: we   expanded the document to cover evaluation in general. We're including an   indication of where particular judgements come from. Including if the   source of checkpoints, what it is. If a human, what judgement was made.   We're also separating the specifics of checkpoints (or whatever they are   called) were passed from the checks. Therefore, a log of the raw data. i.e.   this checkpoint passed this one was not. In principal, we decided to   covered things that were not immediately well-formed XML. But, we did not   get to the details of how to do that. We made a first cut at a pseudo-RDF   diagram of circles and lines of the data structure. Subsequently on the   list, Al has posted something that formalizes without getting into the   angle-brackets what an entry would be.  WL I don't have any corrections, but to supplement. Al's pseudo-code is   pointed to from the agenda. The most significant move was typified by the   change in the name. It represents a tentative expansion of scope as to   reach into other areas other than Accessibility into all W3C areas. This   will take cooperation between PF and technology architecture group.  LK Is there any W3C group that is looking at a higher level review.  WC Quality Assurance activity internal to W3C. Prevent inconsistent   support, like CSS.  WL This project could be a tool for this person/group?  WC Yes. I think this is what Daniel was pushing for.  LK In case of CSS, requires a human to look at? Say rendering of italic.   Have a reference implementation, have a tool that would do pixel by pixel   comparison with proposed implementation.  SL I believe the software conformance for VRML are done that way. The   conformance test suite is done visually.  WL In order for them to claim CSS, they would have to qualify.  LK It looks like they would have a need for a human component even in   principle no human judgement is called.  WC Right, and that's one component of EDL.  LK Right, so adds support to the human component of EDL.  WC Minutes should be out this afternoon.  LK Speaking of PF, is there anything can say about those meetings?  WC Primary topics: SMIL, XMLGL, and TAG.  LK What are going into the XML guidelines.  WC I talked at XML 2000, I'll point the group to my slides. /* quick   overview */  LK Ultimately, EDL besides describing a finished product could also apply   to a description of a language. If you had an XML language defined by an   XML Schema, point into the schema. E.g., where the schema does not show how   to provide text for a media object.  WC not in the initial scope, but in the ultimate scope. An issue with the   XML GL is final form languages like SVGFO. No separation from presentation   and structure.  LK How would you say in EDL that the presentation is not separate from   language.  WC Not my question, but PF issue as to how to handle.  WL GL position will be to separate church and state.  LK That discussion is going on in GL (what is presentation? what is   content?). I gave out a simple example, results were 50/50 (if it were   presentation or content). Will that have any bearing on what we're doing?  WC Don't think we need to wait for that decision.  LK Al's proposal.  WC those of you who did not attend, any questions at this point?  MC What is the scope? Is it intended to be fine grained and say "this   element on this page conforms with this and this but not this and this." or   in general, "this and this ok this is not" or most general, "this page   conforms to Level A according to this eval tool." I'm not sure level this   language speaks at?  WL The first.  LK Right. Also, there could be times when a checkpoint does not just apply   to one element or region but to 2 or more. e.g. an image map. There is a p3   checkpoint in wcag 1 that asks you to use redundant text links. conceivably   2 pointers that are not right next to each other.  MC Is the language intended to be for automatic checks or that the user has   responded?  WL All of the above.  MC How is the presence of meta data on a page expected to be used beyond   the original tool. There is a lot of detail i'm not sure what to do with.  WL When we see, get involved with, and meant for machines, it boggles my   mind. A lot of this depends on future implementations that mine the RDF data.  LK Here are a couple examples  A tool like the WAVE that displays the page w/flags showing where there are   problems. You could have the output used by the tool to add additional   notations. an evaluation tool.  An editor could use this to pick out problems in the code could show   mistakes in line - a flag in the code.  MC An out of line evaluation then back to authoring tool for fix.  LK Yes, the challenge will be to have this ready in a time frame for   authoring tools to implement. I talked with Macromedia a the meeting. How   much work to bring in the outside stream given my deadlines?  MC Yes, and a call for using RDF. A tool like Macromedia parses XML. If   tools already read, then only need a lightweight module to read RDF/XML. My   concern is that will we put energy into something that won't be used.  WL Hotdog already implements it. If you have it in accessibility mode, it   will put in markers.  LK Using internal checks?  WL RIght.  LK Dreamweaver also does internal checks.  WL And HoTMetaL.  MC Forth possible implementation, something recognized by search engines,   filters, etc. that you can say, "only give me pages that have pages w/alt   text." Good use of meta data.  LK Will EDL have use in proxy/repair facilities.  WL Conclusion from the meeting is that as long as its optional/configurable   there is no reason not to work on repair side. i.e. don't impose repair but   you assist for someone that wants to.  WC Other questions?  CR Makes sense. Still processing. Concern is how to push to the rest of the   world? Will it give accessibility a bad name. If you put RDF Into your doc   is the first thing accessibility info.  WC It's an open issue as to where the data is stored. Don't assume its in   the source resource, not yet anyway.  LK If navigation is not consistent between pages, there is no clear page to   put that on.  DB No questions now, but I'll look over the minutes.    Al's proposal  unit evaluation record - Al Gilman, 4 Dec 2000  WC He's saying, however you define unit, here's how you can track an   evaluation for it?  WL Yep.  WC applicationOf seems to refer to URI if on the web, or File:Save if   authoring tool function.  LK applicationOf and whoSez apply to each test?  WL No, those are likely default at top of doc, but as go further there may   be specific ones that aren't.  WC Let's talk with Al on the list, and get him here next week?  WL It's a template. It will serve as a minimum for what you have to do.  LK We'll pursue that will Al.  HB It suggests that there are only small portions of any doc that are to be   evaluated. We can rule out general paragraphs. This is only dealing with   active elements.  WC Don't think you can say that. WCAG deals with all content.  WL Can set up, not dealing with all content.  HB Hate to see it deal with simplicity of language.  WC But this is to track human judgements as well.  LK There is the XML serializing of RDF. Also simpler notation in curly   brackets: subject, verb, object. I suggest that we continue on the list to   come up with those then see where we are.  WC Lots of open issues, e.g. from Len's email/Sean's summary: where does   this go (Rec? Note?), where store this info?  WL Until something there, can't be sure.  LK Authoring tools is a potential consumer of this. The usual time to meet   with AU was last week. When's next time?  WL How about first Tuesday in January. We have a meeting tomorrow.  LK Do they have people lined up to implement ATAG?  WL Yes.  DB Lisa would like hear more about it.  WL Example of storing info is at UWIMP. It's a questionnaire, it generates   a header for your document.  LK RDF?  WL Yes and no. HTML/XHTML can't validate with RDF, so it points to a   statement from the head.  LK A subcommittee of folks from F2F formed to do actual implementation of   RDF. Therefore, talk about it on list.  WC On list for archive purposes.  LK Let's get started on that. It was me, WC, Charles, Daniel, Sean.  Action subcommittee (LK, WC, CMN, DD, SP): first set of RDF triples or   schema by next Monday.  WL We do not want to lose sight that XHTML is XML.  WC right, that's why it's in the initial scope. Using Tidy to transform   HTML to XHTML. Likewise, talked about how to canonicalize ECMAScript so   that can deal with.  Action LK: straw proposal for how to handle languages not in XML.    $Date: 2000/12/11 17:47:02 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

        Hello Roberto,    It is not a mistake.  We removed it for the following reasons:    1. WCAG 2.0 was the only reference in that section.    2. There were several places in the document where we directly linked to an   external resource. WCAG 2.0 was the only one that we had an indirect link   to  (i.e., instead of linking directly to WCAG 2.0 in the text, we linked   to a target in the references section and then the target linked to the   external WCAG 2.0 resource). Instead, we now directly link to all of the   resources throughout the document.    Is this an issue that you feel needs to be fixed?  If so, does it need to   be fixed before moving to TR?

      available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/2000/08/14-minutes.html    14 August 2000 ER WG Telecon    Summary of action items and resolutions  ?       Action LK sendto the ER list a proposal for how to define and   navigate instances of classes.    Participants  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Harvey Bingham  ?       Chris Ridpath  ?

Gregory Rosmaita    Agenda  Agenda is available from the archives.    Action items from 7 August  ?       Action WL Start the basis of "What are the accessibility features   of RDF"  WL believes that RDF will help the device-independence movement move away   from writing content for each device.  LK Two instances:  Knowledge in RDF, generate content from that  RDF to say things about pages  WL RDF will be a mechanism that will increase Web commerce even more.    ?       Action WC: Check out schematron, how can we make it more precise?  WC In process. Not sure reading rules correctly. Play with more, send   questions to Dan and Rick.    ?       Action LK post links to ASSETS and CUU  ?       Action LK post link to XML 2000 to the list.  done    ?       Action WC ask JB who she knows in the area that might be able to host.  WC Lots of contacts, WAI domain discussion. PF also meeting.  LK With PF, good opportunity for us to discuss nitty gritty of standards.  WL PF is conduit to technical folks.    WAVE  WL Can WAVE detect non-w3c technologies.  LK General question, would be good to come up with an algorithm for this in   general.  WL Could there be a WAVE logo?  LK There's no such thing as WAVE approval.  WL WAVE tested.  LK The approval would be W3C. WAVE tested is a marketing thing.    Javascript  LK This is a non-w3c technology. If something sent to a cgi, then don't   know what's coming back.e.g., the IRS site, don't know if text or PDF is   coming back. From a human point of view, once you've identified   "document.write()" or ... rollovers can be decorative or cause a pop-up   with information. Once you've alerted people to the javascript you can ask   them to test the page with javascript turned off.  MC We're trying to provide automatic support for as many things as   possible. That type of technique would not be appropriate.  LK Right, more of a WAVE thing. Trying to do everything automatic seems   impossible. A-Prompt is more in the spirit of manual than automatic.  CR As automatic as we can make it.  WL Bobby, A-prompt, and WAVE have different approaches?  MC All similar right now, "ooh, you've got a script."  CR Sometimes hard to make a decision. e.g., hard to parse script to   determine if it will flicker.  WL Does anyone parse javascript?  CR a-prompt no  MC bobby no, but want to  LK no. So, none of us do but we all want to.  MC We can pattern match, but we aren't parsing. therefore could find "open"   but wouldn't know if it is window.open or a user defined open.  LK Can you just look at the code or do you have to simulate it?  MC Need an object model for the script. Don't need to simulate running it   if we have the correct model.  LK I could imagine a program where "foo" is either a window or something   else. But, you don't have strong typing. Let's say somebody likes to use   foo as a dummy variable that they use and reuse. e.g., could be a number,   characters, a window...  MC You have to evaluate the if statements, which leads you towards   simulating the program. If we know we are catching 99% of things, have we   caught it? If can't be 100% worth doing at all?  WL The amount of trouble decides that. Anything helps.  LK Answer is different depending on the type of tool. If have some user   intervention and get a false positive, ok. However, if automatic then   perhaps not.  MC Put in AERT let tool designers decide. However, need to say how many   potential false positives exist.    Chunking  HB I extracted about 1/3 of their pages, w/out graphics. They are using   horizontal tabs at top. They started adding new tabs for each new section   of their site and recently simplified.  LK In terms of existing structures, list is nice. Headings are pieces of   title. Nothing that says what it is a heading of.  WL You can have classes of headings and accessing what that class means.   Discussion on WCAG about styles and class. should "sidebar" be an h3?  LK Additional conversation. Not obvious place in conversation. That is not   a concept in HTML.  WL It becomes a visual class. Does jumping from a style to a style   constitute structure?  LK We could propose that class should be made visible. I should be able to   get names of classes and human readable names associated with classes. In   WCAG a rule that you would use this. PF develop namespaces. In ER tools   would hunt for places where classes ought to be used. We can start it here.  WL Is this a resolution?  LK Proposal: I have a document that defines a class "sb." I have some way   to define that that stands for sidebar. A user agent comes along and reads   what those classes are and allows me to navigate by instances of class.  MC How does it extend CSS?  LK it's like alt-text for a class.  Action LK sendto the ER list a proposal for how to define and navigate   instances of classes.  MC Don't want to supersede XML.  LK If you look at the text of the guidelines (all) they define logical   styles like example, checkpoint, etc.  MC Class is not part of the style sheet.  LK Where else can you use it?  HB It's up to the application.  LK Examples?  HB Use it in digital talking book.  LK So those user agents must do something with the subclasses.  HB It's XML. Allows us to say, "this H1 is a chapter." Reads class name.  LK Is there some way to have a string that is read aloud rather than class   name itself?  HB They did not do that with talking book, no. It simply reads the class name.  LK There are some classes that I do not want public.  WC How specify?  LK Another attribute?    $Date: 2000/08/15 13:47:43 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

By saying that there are two types of tables we are trying to identify if a   cell can exist on its own.  Data tables usually rely on some relationship   between cells, whereas the cells of layout tables can usually exist on   their own.    for example, if a table is used to layout a navigation bar, there is no   "relationship" between the cells.  Yes, they are all related and thus   grouped into a table, but they could each exist "on their own" on the page   as a single piece of information.    a cell in a data table on the other hand, often needs a header to make   sense.  for example, "33" does not make sense until associated with its   header "jersey numbers of heisman winners."    Yes, the only way _to be sure_ which type of table it is, is to ask the   author.  However, a few things could be tested:  1. if there are no TH elements, it might be used for layout.  or vice-versa, if there are TH elements, it might be used for data.  2. if there is only one column or one row it might be layout.    > > 1.

      is there a meeting today?  --wendy        

        Hello,    Does anyone want to volunteer to write an app that would transform 0.95   earl to 1.0?  Sean wrote an 0.9 to 0.95 conversion in python (that converts   earl in n3) [1].  It would also be nice to have help writing up a prose   version of the diffs between 0.95 and 1.0 to be included in an appendix.    spec update  - I finished incorporating the rest of sean's writing from a while   ago.  Are there any pieces that people feel I missed?  - There are some new bits throughout the introduction.  - Finally filled in the extensibility section [2] based on an example Sean   wrote.  Since we decided not to add Severity to the schema, I used it as an   example extension.    Today I'll be making some changes to the schema (primarily testmode),   describe reliance on DC terms (e.g. date), and include the   normalization/robust metadata proposal as an issue to be resolved in a   future draft or separate draft (it could be its own thing - thoughts?).  If   no one volunteers to do the diffs between 0.95 and 1.0 then I'll do that as   well.    I have to do the usual checks (spell check, syntax validity, w3c   publication rules, etc.), fix one of the images, make sure images are   described well, properly link to references, etc. etc.    All in all, hoping this goes to TR *soon*.  Any and all comments welcome.

      Case study: Supporting students with learning difficulties and disabilities   through the learning centre.    College: Tile Hill College, Coventry  Author: Sarah Parkinson, Flexible Learning Manager  Availablea at: http://ferl.becta.org.uk/frames/cstudies/tilehill/sldd.htm    Interesting quotes:  1. From the initial opening of The Learning Centre we found that, in common   with the majority of our 16-19 year old students, a number of students with   mild to moderate learning difficulties and disabilities from the School of   Learning Support were eager to explore our new IT facilities and make use   of the available on-hand IT support. The Learning Centre can act as an   effective motivator for students who want to be involved in this exciting   and attractive development. We soon found that The Learning Centre offered   an excellent opportunity for SLDD students to integrate with mainstream   students in a relatively non-threatening environment. Our experience showed   that students from the School of Learning Support were often quiet and   withdrawn when initially entering the Centre, but that their confidence   generally increased as their IT skills improved.    2. Firstly, students with poor Literacy skills were attracted to the high   pictorial content of many web-sites and enjoyed being able use of a   facility which is still widely considered to be at the cutting edge of   technology In addition, the students were able to recognise icons for   navigating the Web and, in doing so, were able to direct their own learning.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    The ER WG would like clarification on the differences of the following   TABLE attributes: "summary" and "title" and the CAPTION element.    The HTML 4 spec [1] says:  <BLOCKQUOTE>  summary = text [CS]  This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure for   user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and Braille.    title = text [CS]  This attribute offers advisory information about the element for which it   is set.    When present, the CAPTION element's text should describe the nature of the   table. The CAPTION element is only permitted immediately after the TABLE   start tag. A TABLE element may only contain one CAPTION element.    Visual user agents allow sighted people to quickly grasp the structure of   the table from the headings as well as the caption. A consequence of this   is that captions will often be inadequate as a summary of the purpose and   structure of the table from the perspective of people relying on non-visual   user agents.    Authors should therefore take care to provide additional information   summarizing the purpose and structure of the table using the summary   attribute of the TABLE element. This is especially important for tables   without captions. Examples below illustrate the use of the summary attribute.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    The WCAG techniques document [2] says:  <BLOCKQUOTE>  Provide a caption via the CAPTION element.  Provide a summary via the "summary" attribute. Summaries are especially   useful for non-visual readers.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    The following examples are given:  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <TABLE border="1"             summary="This table charts the number of                      cups of coffee consumed by each senator,                      the type of coffee (decaf or regular),                      and whether taken with sugar.">        <CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>  </BLOCKQUOTE>    The ER working group has the following questions:    What structural information is supposed to be included in the summary:  1. notification of nested tables?  2. notification of spanning cells?  3. number of rows, columns?    If we assume a DOM is available, then at least 3 is easily available.  Are   1 and 2?    Or does the content of summary describe what the structure does not reveal.   the intended content. the larger semantic in which this table fits?  for   example, "summary" could suggest that you have 5 income categories and 4   expense categories.  In this example, there are most likely 9 columns each   with an expense or income heading.  there are also two other headings, one   that spans 5 columns ("Income") and one that spans 4 columns ("Expenses").    Can we draw parallels between alt and longdesc for images?  Is CAPTION like   "alt" and "summary" like "londesc"?  If so, where does "title" fit into the   picture?    If you provide a "summary" do you also need to provide a CAPTION?    Are both optional or are they both recommended?  WCAG Checkpoint 5.5 says   "Provide summaries for tables" (P3) with "summary" as the example way to do   it.  It seems that this checkpoint could apply to both "summary" and CAPTION.    Thoughts?    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS-19990505/#tables  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      William,    I think this is a good start.  It's short and clear.  I have not compared   it with other drafts to make sure that everything is there nor have i   thoroughly tested to make sure that it is not ambiguous.    We ought to take a couple drafts and pass them by folks who will be   implementing this stuff and keep track of their questions and   comments.  "Usability testing" of our drafts to find out what works and   what does not.  This was discussed briefly at yesterday's meeting and has   been part of the requirements for the next draft for some time. We have   verbal agreements from a couple usability testing places to periodically   test drafts for ease of reading, comprehensibility, ease of use, etc.    As a first pass on this...    Kynn, Cynthia, Rob, Dick, Katie, others,  You seem to be in the most contact with folks who are trying to implement   the guidelines.  Do you think it would be helpful to ask a few of those   folks to review and compare William's latest draft [1], the latest   reformulation [2], and the WCAG 1.0 checklist [3]?  Then report back to the   list their comments and questions?    --wendy    At 07:20 AM 9/8/00 , William Loughborough wrote:  >The "guide to the guidelines" is now replete with links to various   >documents.

In other words, summarizing the table within the text of the document? Or are you saying some other reference to the table is made within the text of the document?    My concern with summarizing the table within the text of the document is then there is not an explicit relationship between the summary and the table.    >What if the whole  >page is about one table - is a summary really needed, or does the entire  >page count as the summary?    I think it depends on what the table includes.  If the table is one large set of data, a summary is very useful (sometimes necessary? Jason - do wish to comment further? I remember you having strong feelings about summaries).  If the table is only used for layout I think it is less necessary, but depending on the complexity of the layout could be helpful for someone using a magnifier who has difficulty "wayfinding" in a large table.  Anyone else wish to comment?    I think we need more research here. Anyone wish to volunteer?  Annuska?      >Regarding #2 - The success criteria lists 3 things to summarize. If  >we're saying that only tables with these items need to be summarized, I  >think we should word it like:  >"Provide a summary for tables with nested heading and/or cells that span  >multiple columns or rows. The summary should explain the relationship  >between the cells."    That is more precise. Good.  Although, does it cover everything?  What about number of cells?  If a table has more than 20 cells (a very arbitrary number - more thought ought to be given to the exact number), a summary should be provided.  Or, if it has more than 3 columns and/or rows.  We played with these types of definitions a bit during WCAG 1.0 when trying to define "complex table."      >Regarding #3 - Deciding whether or not a "relationship is obvious" is  >not testable because it depends on the person evaluating the page. I  >think it should be omitted or put in a "non-testable" section.    Perhaps if the HTML algorithm to determine headings for cells fails to find any headings then the relationship is not obvious.  http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3    >In response to the issue about other applications that require  >summaries, here's a list:  >- Visual representations of data, such as a graph (e.g., a line graph)  >or chart (e.g., bar chart)  >- Diagrams (e.g., network topology)  >  >These items should be supported with a summary to explain their context  >or purpose.

This is just to get a feel for consensus on edits   not to bring the group to consensus.  Break into groups to discuss technology-specific techniques. As part of   this discussion, consider how we will handle "until user agent" clauses.   Can we get rid of? Do we need to state assumptions? Is there some way to   say "this is ideally what we'd like but it's not supported yet so in the   meantime..."  Should we consider XML in this document or keep it separate?  ?       KB believes that creating a new language and writing content in a   language are two different activities for two different audiences, thus   keep them in separate documents.  ?       JW believes that these documents and practices are quickly converging.    Discuss user interface metaphors and how they are influenced by changes in   technology like Voice Browsing and XForms. How will we address these   metaphors in WCAG 2.0?    Open discussion about reactions to the Device Independent Authoring   Workshop to harvest interesting ideas, update those who did not attend, and   give those who did attend a chance to digest.    With regards to the afternoon with AU WG: ask them to review WCAG 2.0 for   dependencies with ATAG 1.0 and discuss how filling out a Web form can be   creating Web content.    Planning  ?       When should we aim to go to last call?  ?       When would people like to see a Recommendation?  ?       When and where is our next face to face meeting? Volunteers to host?  ?       When should we publish working drafts of the techniques that we've   discussed?  ?       Are people interested in inviting experts in various technologies   to present to the group to educate us and for Q&A about how our spec   relates to other technologies? e.g., invite a MathML guru to discuss MathML   so we can determine how well our draft will cover MathML as well as what   techniques we should develop for MathML.    Normative vs. Non-normative (?  issue #17 in the issues list). As part of   this discussion Kynn will hopefully demonstrate (or at least discuss) using   XML/XSLT to generate multiple versions of the document.  ?       If multiple versions exist, how does one claim conformance? How do   we write the conformance statement?  ?       How does one claim conformance on muliple views of documents? How   does an author who is generating multiple views determine if they conform?  ?        Gregory and William will present "cyber-ghetto" issues.    Summary of action items  ?

Get "ya's -   good edit" or "nay's - bad edit." Ya's we'll leave as is, the Nay's we'll   go through once we get back and work on to make better. I would like clear   idea if we have consensus on these changes, some were fairly substantial  CS and GR agree good idea.  JW CMN suggests a techniques session. Wishes ATAG would have done more work   on Techniques before going to Rec.  CS, LRG, WC like that idea.  JW Editing on the spot, proposing techniques in smaller groups. Whole group   considering.  WC Also help us to see who interested in which technologies.  GR Definitely helped with UAAG Guidelines last year.  WL Which languages?  WC Name any of 'em! Should first write about those that we get the most   questions about, but should help people using whatever language conform to   WCAG.  WL Want parallel documents to HTML and CSS?  WC Yes.  JW And checklists as discussed last week.  WL The number of items that will be covered by these technologies will be   small. Of the 65 checkpoints, SMIL is only associated with 2.  JW Yes, there will be a limited number.  WC What about XML? Kynn, still think it should be a separate document?  KB Different audience: using a technology versus creating a new language.  JW Think the distinction will become less.  Resolution: put it on the agenda  CS Stating our assumptions. What do we expect a browser to do? Make that   more concrete.  JW UAAG will be relevant. By the time WCAG 2.0 begins process to Rec we   should have UAAG in place. Will be dependency on them.  CS How to determine when UUA clause is met.  WC Or how to get rid of it.  CS Although spec will always be ahead of implementation.  LGR Seems at odds with the backwards compatibility item.  MM The existing UUA are preferable but not reliable, it is the direction   W3C wants the technology to head. Since Backwards compatibility is the goal   of several specs it seems to put it in "this is how things should have been."  JW We have by and large eliminated "until user agents." last week,   discussed the idea that requirements that are dependent on UA should be   treated in techniques with exceptions and qualifications.  WC Perhaps part of the break-out groups discuss until user agents in   regards to specific technologies in break out sessions on techniques.  JW user interface design and metaphors are being influenced by Voice   Browser working group and XForms.  CS With several of us going to the DIW there should be good new info.  WC Should we have a discussion about that for those who did not go (an   update) as well as letting those of us who did go share thoughts and ideas?  /* lots of agreement */  WC Anything in specific to discuss with AU WG?  JW What dependencies do we have that ought to be discussed?  WC Anything in particular we want them to think about or read? The new   draft? Specific checkpoints?  WL Forms. Cuts across UA, WCAG, and AU. The browser or server becomes an   authoring tool.  WC What exactly do we need to ask?  WL We have to make our forms requirement so that it acknowledges what the   ATAG requires.  WC So we can ask AU WG for help how to address that.  WL When you fill out a form on a Web page you are a Web author.  MM You're average content management system is essentially that.  WC HTML WG asking for requirements, spend some time thinking about at the   F2F or on the list?  JW We're getting a lot of agenda items, prioritize?  WL HTML, Techniques, when a technique is applicable to a variety of   technologies and priorities appears in one place with no caveat.  JW We haven't dealt with priorities yet.  WC Planning - set milestones, aim for when go to last call, next f2f, etc.  WC Normative vs non-normative  GR Home page: no link to test pages.  Action WC: Add link to test pages from WCAG Home page underneath the work   on Techniques section.  /* WC goes through proposed agenda items */  GV We have not dealt with the document-based vs. server-based flexibility.   How do our guidelines work if the server actually serves different pages to   different people. "All content should be servable that meets the following   specs."  JW Basically what guideline 2 says. If there are issues with that, then we   should put them into the discussion.  GV One form kicks it out as vanilla HTML (no tables, charts, etc.) like an   alt-text page. In old one, alt-text page is last resort. Perhaps it should   be a first resort if it is databased based.  JW /* Reads from latest draft */  GV Have this discussion before the XML discussion.  JW That's where guideline 6 comes into play - requirements for if you need   to provide a style sheet or other mechanism, etc.  Action WC: Add dynamically generated (from database) to open issues list.  WC Kynn - how's your XSLT with WCAG coming along? Want to demo?  KB Not sure that it will be ready, but could discuss.  WC People find that valuable?  GV Have to discuss after the normative/non-normative version so that people   know what to conform with.  WL In the checklist document, "if you are using tables, vs frames" etc is a   mini-thing of what we are talking about.  JW Yes, include on agenda. If using XSLT to create the versions, the XML   would have everything. That could be downloaded as the document set.  KB Try to have something available.  WL We are in danger of ignoring the "cyber-ghetto." This discussion reeks   of this issue. Possible that things like "final form" can be exclusionary.   /* part of the database discussion */  GR Having a floppy with agenda, documents, etc.would be helpful.  Action WC: Summarize agenda items. Propose times for handling.  CS Either now or on the list, discuss what groups of technologies we want   to discuss.    $Date: 2000/09/28 22:07:17 $ Wendy Chisholm      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Minutes from Friday's WCAG meeting will be sent separately.    --w      01 March 2001 F2F meeting minutes (AU/ERT/WCAG)  The minutes for both the morning and afternoon sessions are contained in   this document. In the a.m. the AU WG and ERT WG met along with several   visitors. The p.m. session was a joint meeting between AU WG, ERT WG, WCAG   WG and visitors.    Summary of action items, resolutions, and open issues  ?       Resolved: WCAG Will consider EARL as basis for conformance. Places   this on the open issues lsit.  ?       Resolved: WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each   requirement can be referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test   results to be associated with it.  ?       Resolved: add to AU issue list: add requirement that tools import   EARL. note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear that EARL has   firmed up.  ?       Action CMN take issue about UA checking EARL statements about a   page to ERT and UA.  ?       Issue: implications on EARL as to how to express for UA.  ?       Resolved: WCAG will adopt those aspects of AERT into HTML   techniques that are relevant.  ?       Resolved: do this type of meeting again at a plenary like this.

Susan Lesch - W3C, review for WCAG    EARL  LK Language used to describe if web content is accessible. more general for   other types of testing. comes up with vocabulary that may be as wide as   possible. the examples that are canned deal with accessibility of web   pages. scenarios for uses of EARL /* link */ We want to get specific about   vocabulary.  LK In web accessibility, there are many places where the judgement has to   be made by a person. e.g. an image with alt-text. If you have an image of a   cow and the image is a horse, you need a person to recommend what the   alt-text should be.  LK 1st scenario - person gets a report. need way to combine comments from   various people or tools. compare results to one or more standards - in the   states such as 508 vs WCAG. Ideally, a language to translate between   standards. A corporation may have their own standards.  CS Discussion in WCAG of a conformance schema, what's that about?  CMN Instead of conformance to guidelines at level X, have finer-grained or   partial conformance. e.g., I use a mouthstick, there are 9 checkpoints in   UAAG that are critical to me but don't care about visual checkpoints. Can I   use this system to do that. one goal of using RDF, is to make sure you can   do that.  DD The 3 WAI guidelines are for web content, user agent, authoring tool -   what it means to be accessible for each. We have been good at specifying   conformance to each guideline. Each have checkpoints with priorities. There   is a conformance claim you make, Level A etc. (DD explains). In terms of   the accessibility report, we have a way to point into our spec that we can   directly reference. The problem is made complex by the requirement of human   judgement. We can not automate everything. If you co nsider SVG test suite   it is harder to point at testable assertion, but the test is look at   something - is the circle red. It is more objective at looking at assertion   but harder to point at what is the purpose of the test. This language will   have to take into account both kind of evaluation.  LK We have a problem of specifiying conformance in SVG, are there other   comments on that before we move on?  RN From the implementation side, if you break it into qualitative verus   quantitative, when we write tests, we have to document our requirements. I   would like to see a requirement based guidelines, where i can easily see   subjective or not. if quantitative i can write a test for that. otherwise,   what a space for comments or someone else to read.  LK For qualitative judements, in addition to a statement would you want a   scale?  RN feasible, but still human judgement. 1,2,3 can say qualitative. if p3   and qualitative, i may not have resources to do that. how do you get buy in   from the retail side. have to get it as easy as possible. get a quick hit.  CMN Two threads coming together: how do you test something against a test   suite. when we looked at this, rdf seemed a good pick since it let you deal   in things with URIs. if your test suite is 10K cases and each is a page,   and requires a human. as long as you have what needs to be done described   with a URI, then using RDF can say, "this conforms." ATAG gives tests for   how to determine conformance. 1. can you insert an image? 2. can you give   an equivalent? each has a URI.  LH Unlike accessibility standards, we don' thave a clear set of test   assertions. In practise, I synthesize those where implied. You extract a   doc fromt he spec which is test assertions. then you apply those same   processes to the intermediate document.  DD you create a test of chekcpoints?  LH You have to deduce them.  LK You can imagine a lang where each output statement refers to a   particular test, or imagine that it points to something more atomic then   derive if particular checkpoints are produced. You can say this image meets   checkpoitn 1.1 or alt-text exists. then you have another set of rules that   says, 1.1 is ... and in 508 it's ... i wonder if that would be aof   ofrmalizing that.  CMN In the toy that danbri and i made took advantage of that. we had atomic   tests with rules. if you meet all p1's then you meet the atomic test which   is wcag level A.  CS Would it be useful to create markup to define those standards? A way to   describe why want test and rules for what test against.  CMN The user interface is the key bit.  CS Some people will do it directly in XML with a text editor, some people   will want a GUI.  DD I would like to hear from lynn or lofton, we're not inventing something   new here. People have been working on results to tests. They were specific   to a testing technology or specific technology. OASIS has come up with XSLT   evaluation. The etc people have an ISO framework for presenting test   result. keep in mind there are specification of requirement.  LK As people bring up requirements, I want to list them here. Is there a   meta requirement.  CMN Derive a result from other results.  DD These look like requirements for harness rather than language.  RN The language has to generate a report. Also add, modify, delete and   change my report. I don't care what it does, what I want is a report that I   can hand to management. With 508, the coformance is up to each agency to   decide how they will handle it. It applies to corporations and companies.   No one wants a document, it can be supoenaed. You have to have a report.   Who are the players and the end result?  DDimitriadis In specifying DOM tests, the language is indpendent of adding   mechanisms to the test suite. You extend your test suite rather than the   language.  DD Have to be clear not to confuse the language (keep track of test   results) with pretty output. Another language is the language to express   the test. WIll find lots of same data in the result.  Lofton An ad hoc design for SVG work. Similar to test expression language   that NIST has done. It's simple XML grammar that encapsulates the test   purpose, the checkpoints (operator script). Descriptive prose on what you   should see, what should happen, how to issue pass/fail.  LR If you are doing conformance, when you test for it, it has to trace   itself back to a requirement in the spec. You are bound in scope to what   the spec says. Our test suites are based on the same philosphy. We have   test assertions (your checklist), then test purposes and cases. We   represent this in a DTD. Easy to add new tags. All tags have an   identification, purpose, owner, etc. Lots of identification info. You can   generate almost any kind of report you want. On the harness, you can always   view the source code, find the test requirement, link to that clause in the   spec. It's not like a formal language.  PJ The title EARL is what I thought we were working on, but when I hear   "test language" and "reporting lagnuage" I am concern about scope.  LK Testing is expansion of evaluation?  PJ test language is source of running the test. EARL says there is an URI   for the test thatmaps to a requirement. When we specify language of the   test, perhaps too low level. Want to make sure that things scale. Want to   scale at different points. if I have a checkpoint that syas "provide alt   for content." different ways to do it. can say do or don't vs. having test   id's for what i can do to validate.  LH I think the weakest point in our work is the expression of results. I've   seen everything from our earliest suites (a pad of paper), to work with DOM   where you get a visual highlighted result back (indicating pass/fail).   That's what itnerested me in this work. Not sure see the distinction   between evalution and report. Report is result of running evaluation.  LK Evaluation is something that could be read by an authoring tool as well   as particular report.  JT One way I envision this being used, if we have a number of different   evaluation tools and repair tools, a language to express what the authroing   tool evaluates and repairt, then can match up report with a repair tool   that repairs those pieces. Report could contain the EARL.  PJ Making conformance claims is different than results of tests.  CMN Testing is good for feedback on the spec.  DD Scenarios where person does not know how to fix, all you may know is   that hte browser has a problem. The repair info is valuable in others it is   irrelevant. Therefore separated in the language.  DDimitriadis Description of test could be x language y technologies. We   want one eval language, so yes separate. While specifying DOM, if write   atomic tests, e.g. I want to test 1.2.3 it is easy to do a conformance   rating. You generate result then put indication on result. We would like to   have scenario driven tests, "a user wants to add 5 lines of text and change   the screen, etc." Can not express is atomic points. Therefore, output   language probably not output. Put this on the agenda. Capture things based   on prose descriptions.  CMN The repair info that you might carry and ultimately the value is so you   can use it to fix tings. the repair comes out of the tests not the   language. make sense to make sense to make enough use of language that can   say, "here is the test. here's what it says about how to fix." this outside   scope of language itself. I used RDF because the test becomes a URI. I'd   like to see us talk about what the language might look likt and what RDF   might do for us.  MRK I don't see a problem with the language containing more info. The UI   can sort it out. Put info about what needs to be tested, what has been   tested, Advice for how to repair, show in different place.  KD Possible to make scenario based on atomic test. Can we establish   relationship between test and scenario.  CMN We used RDF to describe and needed inference engine.  DDimitriadis Writing tests or results?  CMN Ennumerate tests. Then ennumerate rules for combining tests. If you   pass 1,2,3 you get stamp A.  PJ Very faimilar with XML, don't know RDF. How does it relate to XML.  MRK Scope of the tests? Explain part of the document needs a test and the   whole doc and then the site?  CMN Anything that has a URI - a single element, a whole site.  MRK Put them all together.  RN In my informal survey, there are 1 in 50 that state in contracts: use   HTML 4. don't want to bind themselves. Need to carry on explanation why   something fails. need good examples. easy to read. one centralized tool: do   HTML, do x. One access point. re: test conditions: implementation issue is   that there are over 40 browsers where you can't turn javascript on/off or   css. if make test condition, "now turn off css" or "invert colors." then   you don't rely on how a browser works. it will tell you how.  LK We've been hearing about meta requirements. In terms of pinning down how   and if use RDF. Which of these considerations are teh key things we should   focus on.  AB Why would you consider using RDF? XML?  RS This a.m's discussion is about what you want to describe and how to   point people to more info. In the course of describing these things, you'll   figure out which concepts to encode. RDF and variety of notations will do   in a variety of ways. must first figure out what want to express.  LK Ground rule: as we talk about general requirements, it should be   accompanied by a concrete example.  CS Like to see output importable by bug tracking systems. What line of   code, test, etc. If you end up with 1,000 reports.  LK Want something that could attach any sort of machine readable info?  CS Want to see output, may be a tool issue. Bobby does this, when you get a   report.  CMN Why RDF instead of XML? Wanted to refer to anything in the universe as   a test. RDF model, X has relationship Y to Z. X, Y, Z are URIs.  LK How does that grab you?  AB Right. Seems that people needed clarification.  RS When LK and I talked about this. One question that we thought we might   want to answer was to describe the e-mail traffic over the last few weeks.   Ultimately, what we do with this will be expressable in XML (i.e. no angle   brackets in my description) rather the mechanism. I drew this example to   tie to the N3 description. The notion is that we have stuff. Each oval is a   thing. One is "pat" two don' thavfe names. there is a relationship between   pat and the 1st unknown thing called "child." imagine that the objects   we're talking about are some bit of markup that exists on the web. the   thing on the left is an XHTML markup. it has an img element that fails one   of your tests. #img failsReqruiement http://www.w3.org/some-wcag#p1.   document and conformance claim that is being failed. what is the   conformance test? that's for you to define. prose is good for human   readers, not for machines. What else can we say? We add relationships   between the conformance tests and what repair tools can do. You get to   describe the relationships, their names, their semantics. We can name   anything. failsRequirement is a name of a concept. it will have a URI that   you can follow to find out what it means. We can find out info about any   thing in this relationship. To make it easier to express what's going on in   this image, we have RDF and N3 that we can express it in.  /* go to pat example with 2 children example in N3 primer LINK */  RS What are the attributes of tests that we want people and machines to   discover? What does this relationships mean? How we write them in e-mail,   we need to agree on notation but focus on concepts. Don't spend a lot of   time on syntax. Further info is who made the claim, what did they base it   on, what tool decided it was the relationship that exists, etc. Let's   define the concepts then go to the RDF spec.  CMN What makes this useful in the real world? The use case that PJ and NIST   have. Do testing, get results, etc. Another is Jutta's. If a small shop may   have 8 tools, if larger have 8 departments. What kinds of tools exist?  RN Lots of tools exist. Test conditions will come upon the tools and pages.   We need to prioritize what we do first.  JT seems to be an open issue about what EARL will actually be used for.  DD Here is a vocabulary of things to express.  testinfo - framework (wcag, svgspec, htmlsyntax), test id, test purpose,   code?, manual y/n  result info - individual result (url pass/fail, confidence level, syntax   error line)  repair ino - (optional)  run info - contraints platform, operator instructions (merge EARL Language   with harness language)  are there additional items we should store and process? /* get rationale   and requirements from DD */ perhaps syntax error line is based on something   more generic.  LR Under result info, I would like to see person info as well as date tests   are run. It is important to note that these reports can be used in   different purposes and ways. Dependin gon if i'm going to repair or as a   report to claim conformance, the type of info i get out of the report or   how i use the report will be different. think about how used to make sure   it's all covered.  LK After break let's flesh out addtional info that we want here.  /* break - most of the RDF folks leave */  /* DD changes "schema" displayed on screen on the fly to incorporate   comments */  RS notation and syntax are not user interface. The purpose of the syntax is   to exchange stuff between tools.  RN In two week sin new orleans is a conference by carnegie mellon. seems to   be synergy.SEI - Software engineering institute. Model for how you do   software engineering. Those are foundations for building software.  RS the way you specify the date of the result and the page what information   do we want to record.  LK The question is do we want to record an individual date and stamp for   each element? Some images change. for example, banner ads will change.  RS Test date applies to all.  WC Not necessarily. Test could be on an element or even attribute level.   Tool could only care about one or other.  RN code on the page, versus what's on the page.  CS Separate test from subject of test. Subjectmight be page or image,   runnin ghte sam etest.  WC Harness?  DD framework of interaction that leads you to a result. there are languages   to express how you move from page to page. The test info is part of the   harness.  LK The question on the floor: what does the test mean adn what is the scope   of these thigns?  CMN The scope of the test is whatever you are making the assertion about.   it should be a requirement at an atomic level at an individual object, or   page, or whatever atom you can think of.  KB We need to say that something applies to more than one URL. e.g., ,in   alt-text applies not only to image file but image tag. assertion of   alt-text is about 2 things.  LK good point. let's get to that point after this one.  CS It seems that that is not a test. The test is what you do. If you are   testing a site, you might test index.html (subject) test is "does it   conform" don't wan to mix those in a single term. suggest s wording change?   test case - do these steps, and test object.  CMN Think we're in agreement except on terminology.  JT 2 pieces of inof that relate to test: what the outcome is and how we're   testing it.  JR Instead of something fails, it's that "it fails on the basis of the test."  JT What is the test testing for?  RN Trying to describe test conditions.  CS language should express both automatic and manual tests.  CMN In one sense there is a test that you run. it says "open browser, turn   on the feature, make it happen." that is test case info. result info says,   "thi si sthe verson, browser, etc." Or test case "go to this store to this   shelf and buy the 3rd box...etc." whatever it is, you need the instructions.  CS I have seen this factored effectively: test case - what you have to do   again later, result - what happened.  CMN Are we testing rendered stuff or code? 1 - http.w3.org/image does the   alt-text work? human result. 2. validator says some element fails some   requirement of html spec. completely machine run. code level. don't think   we are writing the test language, we're discussing what we expect to be in   it. ratehr the result language.  KB Generalize platform to context.  RS Don't get rid of details like platform - will help you keep track of   details.  PJ Depends on the test you are doing.  RN I see 2 issues. we're all users. perhaps we're getting caughtu pon test   methodology. we're trying to show our wish list. can we brainstorm what we   want, then we could talk to a test engineer for the best approach. best way   can change - test case/test suite, etc. what do we want to accomplish?  RS Don't worry too much about packaging. I suspect that one objective is to   capture as much info as we can so we can precisely reproduce the test.   Focus on what data needs to be captured and for whom? don't fall into the   trap of generalizing from one detail. Capture as much detail as comes out   of the brainstorm.  JT We need to address what will the info be attached to. Describe the   results. Scenario: i head company x, we have a document that shows how to   conform to 508, must do these 10 things. i want to find a test tool that do   these things (perhaps more than one tool). then want to repair them. i then   find tools to help me repair these things. need description of evaluation   tool and repair tool and what they test or repair.  CS In a bug report i want to see: the environment (the context that the   tester believes are important - might be platform, browser, etc.),   reproduction steps, date test run, version of code aganst which run, steps   of the test, how make it happen, the expected behavior, observed behavior,   optional things - general comments, line number, messages created by   system, copy of code, screen shots. for interactive testing, but could be   applied to automated testing. e.g. reproduction steps: run page x against   schema y. expected results: i get this file with these results.  LK sequence of steps looks new.  CS If a test is not reproducable, is an error on the tester. expected   results still not captured.  LH Should be in test case info.  CS actual code is not there. image 3 could now be image 5.  CMN Only if you've changed teh page.  DD Could also have copy of subject of test.  CS Likely thta the test is run on monday and person who fix won't get to   until friday and will change by then. won't always be available, e.g.   coming from a cgi.  MC Line of code may not be approach. Could have 10 images on one line.  CS Enough geeky info so that developer can find it easily.  RN Specific test condition: if doing test for wcag, could pick up info in   browser, what about screen readers that dn't provide that info? would we   have a box for other devices?  CS Suggest discuss at tomorrow's meeting to discuss context.  LK Let's capture everything.  RN Other device.  CMN I want to talk about tools in general. I want to know what tools exist   already  KB We need to be able to include a cc/pp profile.  LK Can you make that a specific case of something more general?  KB All the things we're talkingabout as devices and platforms, one way to   do it is cc/pp but not only way.  RS Partly a question of how much you snapshot.  PJ concerned about things changing.  RS recommend a practise that when refer to test case, if we change test   case give changed version diff identifier. how much histrory do you want to   record. propose in each circumstance how to record change info.  RN Do we have the export to another tool?  DD requirement listed. just write a parser.  CS Does require some requirements.  DD Might account for steps in the form. may nt have the data.  CS For these sytems, be invalid and not be imported  CMN A value of including stuff by reference is you can ignore it by   reference as well.  MM if there isn't some way to extend this than how we're envisioning, it   won't be useful to all.  LK Doesn't this get into what RS was talking about? The benefit of   implementin gin RDF is that you can extend it.  RS Right. having a flexible structure, rather than a fixed DTD..most DTD   tools break. suspect want a structure where developers can include   structure of own w/out interfereing with other tools.  LK Is this captured here?  DD Part of the framework. It is a requirement.  CS agree has to be flexible. think the verbs should be user definable. may   only care about pass/fail, or perhaps something richer. might want to look   at modularization. perhap automated module and manual module.  DD Captured in subclasses - page/ataga/uaag/suite/bugtrack.  CMN good thing about rdf module can say how much you are saing then   qualify. different scope of statement - on eline, one word, etc.  DD's notes from discussion (from front of the room visual display)  rationales  ?       keep track of test/evaluation runs (store/transfer)  ?       processing in tools (pretty printed report, generate compatibility   chart, feed other tools, compare with previous runs)  requirements  ?       applicable to testing content/ua/service  ?       generic vocabulary/extensible subclass for   page/atag/uaag/suite/bugtrack...  ?       uri based  EARL schema  ?       testcase info:  ?       test suite id (svgspec, wcag, htmlsyntax...)  ?       assertion id (detail in framework: checkpoint, intermediate test   assertion)  ?       test purpose (prose)  ?       test url (for online test suite)  ?       auto/manual y/n  ?       operator instructions, reproduction steps, expected result  triplet:  ?       subject of the test (url, version/date, snapshot)  ?       result statement (date, what, who, context: ccpp, platform,   devices.. comments, repairinfo)  ?       testcase info (suite, url, purpose, op instruction/steps/expect,   manual)  e.g.  ?       http://example.org/page#img[3] danield says it fails with lynx on   linux, xmas 99.  ?       http://w3.org/tr/wcag#cp1.1, using bobby, manual check  ?       http://foo.com/svgplayer1.23, passes  ?       http://w3.org/tr/svg/ts/assertion1, part of   http://w3.org/svg/testsuite1.0  ?       http://example.org/page on 2001/3/1, syntax error, line12, missing alt  ?       http://validator.w3.org, auto mode    Next steps  JT This afternoon: AU/ERT comment on WCAG 2.0 then go through AERT open   issues WCAG  ?

WCAG 2.0 and it's implciations for AU and ER  ?       Timing of 2.0 guidelines    Participants  CMN, Raman, Helle, Loretta, Jason, Andi, Cynthia, Marti, Jan, Wendy,   Donovan, Marja-Riita, Michael, Brian, Josh, Matt, Harvey, Len, Jutta    Open AERT issues for WCAG  WC HTML specific  LK Solve in relation to 2.0, unless cause need for errata for 1.0.  JW Right, that's what we agreed up on in WCAG a few weeks ago.  CMN The issues seem mostly techniquey, but valuable to go through them.   Spend 2 minutes on each of them or 2 minutes and agree to postpone. Useful   from AU perspective for how WCAG will approach them.  JT Valuable piece of going through today, might relate to revision of WCAG.  WC move that we either limit our time, we have 3 groups here and more   interesting issues to discuss.  JT limited discussion at beginning? 1 limited at end? 5    EARL and WCAG  LK Are tehre people here who have not heard about EARL? Briefly, it is a   machine-readable representation of evaluating a web page. Could contain   suggestions for repair. Applications: raw form that would go into a report   tool. Several different EARLs, conditions, could be merged into one report.   (human readable). also fed into an authoring tool for convienient mechanism   to give tool list of what to repair. in terms of WCAG, there are 2 possible   ways it could impact WCAG. if we assume only used with WCAG, then each   statement could point into techniques (in terms of 2.0) and then give   "passes/fails" or other rating. Another appraoch is for EARL to produce   lower level statements that don' thave checkpoints in them. e.g. "alt text   is missing." Rule sets that take that as input and in the context of WCAG   that violates 1.0 or 1.4. or 508 ruleset. with 1st apprach, wcag would have   machine-readabvle reference. possible to point into wcag. instead of plain   text, in terms of HTML it would say "this is missing an attribute." on the   other hand if EARL reflects more fundamental facts from which you derive   checkpoints, then need rule base to convert to WCAG statements. then, who   writes the rule base and is it infomrative or normative?  CMN Interpretting that into checkpoints. working out how to do a test of   your spec.  RN Timeline for implementation of EARL?  LK Nothing has been committed to?  RN We have people interested in EARL. Talking to Karl Dubost, he said there   was a QA conformance meeting in late march.  CMN I will be there to represent EARL.  LK We are interested in those people joining the effort.  RN One tool on the interest group does a WCAG conformance guideline test.   Will there be correlation?  LK This is a format for out put of tools, not a tool.  CS One bullet point of th eEARL proposal is to compare results to one or   more standards. e.g. internal intranet sites. sounds like something like   specML. If feed a spec in, it has to be machine-readable. what would that   look like? It would be a wonderful thing to have.  CMN COmpare results, isn't new. use an rdf thing. does not provide testing   language. a separate project.  CS How do comparison?  CMN When do the tests, ability to record test and say what test was.  CS How does the comparison work?  CMN If you have 15 things, img have useful alternative? etc. then say 508   conformace you need these 3 tests, for wcag you have 2,3,7,9 out of a   million. designed to allowo ther tests to be allowed.  CS MAchine readable version of WCAG is out of scope or not? that's what i'm   trying to determine.  JT It's not a testing tool, it's a method for tools to talk to each other.  LK As far as our charter is concerned we have a general clause, "helping   development".. My personal opinion is that without formalizing it, using an   existing method with rdf. don't want to invent something new.  JW er will have to resolve how they want to support multiple specifications   in their system. if they think it's useful that the test output should   bemapped to a requirements of multiple specs, then they must figure out how   to implement the system. then a joint work item between wcag and ert. what   are the issues that involve both groups that need to be decided, e.g. issue   of conformance claims. Daniel put together a schema for which to make   conformance assertions. If the new language is appropriate for that role,   and provides appropriate granularity, then WCAG may adopt as base for   conformance claims.  LK At this point, judging by the discussion, people are still formulating.   I don't think we could come to a conclusion this afternoon, it is more of a   heads up. The simplest issue is to at least point into text readable   portions of it.  JW Any XHTML version including techniques would povide anchors. 2.0   techniques written as checkpoints in 1.0 version. possible to refer to any   of them from an external source.  HB The EARL has importance for potential readers for them to say, you   conform at a level that my AT can handle. Should there be a standard link   fromt he doc to the place where teh review may be, is something you may   want to consider. versioning issues: if successful with EARL, go back to   creators of docs. particular review can age. we should be able to notify   the reviewer any time the doc has been updated.  MC EARL as a language speaks to saying this thing conforms with that and   that is a URI. machine readable goes into defining what "that" is. for some   guidelines be easy, for others not easy. abstraction of guidelines from   techniques helps. can put it in the context of a specfici language. some   can not be tied down to one thing. e.g. navigation bars. how define that in   such a way that i will always find it and never not find it. what that   means for wcag is that it's an issue when thinking about the gidelines.   while not tying the guidelines donw to being too specific, need a way to   define what apply to.  MM Making a machine-readable spec, lends self to automated tool. techniques   will be non-deterministic. e.g., wherever we use the word minimize. we can   not look at a doc and determine if we have minized the use of images.  CMN versioning isrequirement for EARL, out of scope for this discussion.   already listed as reuirement. notifying reviewers is not yet in EARL. EARL   let's you point to a test. agnostic about test if it is human or manual.   mapping of how you test if you've met a requirement of wcag, is something   we have to do. we're oblighed to show hwo you conform to the spec. whether   we do that by writing up each technique with a test case or if we do it   afterwards and how is something we have t do. if we make those available,   people reuse known tests. not a wcag issue.  JW Can we brin gthis discussion to a few specific points.  ?       WCAG should decide that it will consider EARL as a possible basis   for conformance claims  ?       WCAG should affirm that designing 2.0 techniques, it will ensure   that each technique and approach to testing are identified with specificity   so that EARL can refer to.  we need to confine ourselves to how we will carry this forward.  /* vote */  JW Only members of WCAG allowed to vote on this.  WCAG Will consider EARL as basis for conformance. Places this on the open   issues lsit. favor 11, against none. Resolved.  WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each requirement can be   referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test results to be   associated with it.  CS clarification - we won't use words likeminimize or make them atomic enough?  CMN test has a URI  KHS We'd have to work hard to not do it.  /* vote on JW's point 2 */  Resolved: WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each   requirement can be referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test   results to be associated with it.  LK question of machine readable rules. don't think we can decide it now.  MM w/out resolving normative vs. informative, end up with orphan   checkpoints. EARL and related testing tools won't be able to test for.  CMN Resolving normative vs informative is work of group in explaining what   it means to conform to.  LK I think there is a misconception. Inability to automate does not put it   outside scope of EARL. It can record results of human judgement. e.g. clear   and simplelanguage.  MM: QA dept. won't be able to determine "minimize". There will be orphan   requirements that beg the answer "well...ok...sure". Not a fully formed   compliance with subjective tests.  WC: There will always be subjective tests. As long as manual steps are   clear, no problem. Claims will always be subjective. If assertion is   machine readable, easier to communicate your case.  CS: "Minimize" is defined at the beginning by designers not athe end by   testers.Assertion made following design.  JW: Proposes to move to the next agenda item.  CMN: Still valuable to thrash this out.  PJ: Wants to talk about necessary and sufficient conditions for techniques.  CW: We whould continue discussion.  /* vote - defeated, discussion will continue */  KB: Agrees with JW.  CMN: EARL doesn't care about wording of tests. It does allow different   results for same test. Primary use is not legal, its so stuff will work. It   builds up a body of previous test judgements.  Josh: EARL expresses too much. WCAG techniques need to be more clear about   what repairs are.  MM: There are design principles that use "avoid" or "minimize".  LK: Subjective cps or techs are totally irrelevant to EARL.  MC: Lots of challenges for EARL to handle conformance for WCAG.  Katie: If terms need to be defined consistently, its something for the   glossary. Implementation model for setting up an accessible site.  WC: Passed to EO.  WC: Would like higher conformance granularity.  CMN: Implications for AU and ER not EARL. Let's move on.  JW: Yes, let's move on and leave aside WCAG issues.  JT 4 issues here: conformance statements, operationalizing requirements,   evaluation, EARL language. Not just about WCAG relates to all.  RN Plant a seed: spec needs to read more like a requirement. requirement   rather than words.  KHS important in 508 stuff to appreciate good faith efforts.    EARL and aU  JT Issues are teh same.  CMN Yes, discussion would be teh same except substitute ATAG for WCAG.  LK As far as applying EARL to specify if an au passes ATAG, but one purpose   of EARL is an info feed into authoring tool. Do you need to take that into   account when write spec? bolted on later?  CMN implementing EARL is a useful technique for bunch of AU stuff. not an   issue but an action on AU WG.  HB Also action on EO. usability and accessibility are foreign to most all   of the books that address web authoring.  LK If i create a EARL report, there is a issue that AU wouild import an   EARL report. specific scenario: dreamweaver. should it be seriously   considered? if so, back of mind with other ATAG requirements.  JT How is EARL used to express ATAG conformance and how it is used to   repair doc.  RN If stored where could be referenced locally, great. Agree with Harvey,   right. We need to state proper terminology.  CMN EARL is considered. Does not give rise to other requirements or issues.   implementation issue.  JR Not sure how EARL is stored, a file or info w/in a doc?  LK That's implementation detail. Info is there, linked with the doc. Like   CSS - in head or linked.  CMN ditto.in ATAG techs, havce to figure it out.  JR One reason this comes up, originally it was so wouldn't have to do   manual checks over and over again.  CS if becomes requirement that extra XML included in doc, likelyu not used.  JR could be stripped out b4 published.  CMN maintain stuff or toss, depends on tool or the stuff.  MRK are mechanisms like annotations. have RDF servers.  LK propose: there be an issue added to AU issue list: add requirement that   tools import EARL. note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear   that EARL has firmed up.  Resolved: add to AU issue list: add requirement that tools import EARL.   note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear that EARL has firmed up.  HB Server should deliver EARL evals to requesting client so that they can   deliver appropriately to what the user's capabilities are.  CMN UA check EARL statemetn about a page.  Action CMN take issue about UA checking EARL statements about a page to ERT   and UA.  Issue: implications on EARL as to how to express for UA.  /* break */  /* donovan minuting */    /* wendy's personal notes */  priorities - inherit - govnt policies are saying Level A of WCAG, and not   necessarily of WCAG 1.0. Requirements - general to HTML - people need to   test for each language. end up with 1.1.1-1.1.15 for HMTL, 1.1.16-1.1.26   for SMIL, 1.1.27-1.1.37 for SVG, etc.  broken up by technologies, but we also have our core techniques which are   cross-technology.  top level also for policy makers and managers.  "fractal worlds" navigation paths through different types of users ("how to   use this document"). Techniques will still exist.

AERT open issues will be incorporated by WCAG   2.0 techniques. agreed upon structure - framework.    /* WC returns to minuting */  Resolved: WCAG will adopt those aspects of AERT into HTML techniques that   are relevant.    Other cross group issues  JT in courseware packages there is content that allows interactive   authoring via the content. also, when is the best timing for ATAG 2.0 to   draw in WCAG 2.0.  WC CR.  JB Get input in lower tiers so don't have to go back to the beginning of   the game.  CMN The goal is that we would shadow up through the process. Best guess of   going to last call and then CR.  WC then shadow our working drafts.  CMN Give us warning for last call.  JW I've seen W3C specs taht say "editors and working group believe next   draft would be  last call." this good idea.    Next F2F meetings  JW For all three?  CMN Do we want to do F2F meetings in conjunction again?  JB Encouraging suggestion: in terms of W3C planning process. Interested to   hear if have morejoint meetings. what are your plans over teh next year. in   generating ideas, we need to rotate the meetings geographically. We end to   get to europe and asia.  CMN bunch of AU people aren't here. this has been really useful.   particularly where we have a joint meeting, then have individual groups to   have meeting but can run next door to get clarification.  WC At October, WCAG proposed going to PR in November of this year and doing   that in Australia.  JB Poll yesterday "wantto do this again?" "6 months?" 38 yeses. "12   months?" 38 yeses. so another opportunity between 6 months and 1 year.  CS How many people going to Hong Kong?  /* 7 */  /* unanimous - do this type of meeting again at a plenary like this. */  RN I like the technology meeting yesterday to find out what is going on.  JB how soon to do next one?  6 montsh - 3  12 months - majority  9 months - 2/3  location - australia, europe, japan, greece, haiti(?)  What aboout a WAI half week (3 or 4 days)  Lots of joint, plenary single group stuff.  JB many organizations say they can not get approval for meetings inHawaii   since a junket. does 4 days considered a week?  CS flying where have 18 hour flight, 8 hours of meeting, 18 hour flight is   impractical.  JW Europe easier?  CS For me europe and australia are somewhat similar. (in terms of travel).  Helle More serious talk about going to europe. we have very few people from   europe here. particularly, where we have smaller companies who are not part   of the w3c work but interested in accessibility or required to consider   them. will help outreach. must do more in europe.  KB Agree with europe idea. We were bought by a european company. Brussels   would be good.  JB The WAI has an explicit obligation this year and next to hold a certain   number of meetings. We've complied with, since the metings in brisotl   however the intent is for outreach and recruitment. there are fascinating   things in europe, due to the commitment on the european union level. an   initiative w/in each country. everyone is doing it differently. a WAI most   of week in europe would be great. Greece is one of the worst.  WC What countries recommend?  JB Can't answer.  WC Finland?  RN Couple this with an outdoor activity.

      Hello all,    It took me a bit longer than usual to post the minutes [4] because I was   trying to close several of my open action items.  I checked with others and   cleaned up the list of action items.  There are still several open.    I added test suites to the deliverables in the draft charter [1], added a   link to the IE Web accessories from existing tools [2], realized that I had   already added the PICS stuff to the WCAG Errata back in January [3], sent a   note to WCAG chairs re: joint meetings (will send note to CG after get   response).

Action WC: send eyetracking tool info to list.  Resolved: we can suggest that a tool should count the number of options in   a list, etc. and offer a threshold for length. Not all tools need to do   this, and we don't have consensus on the lengths to specify.  Action LK: get reference of book re: info of seizures and flicker.  Resolved: Next meeting is July 3, those who can make it will.  Resolved: no meeting July 10, since meeting with AU on the 11th.  Resolved: We will aim to publish another public working draft of AERT by   the end of July (aiming for the week of July 24).    Open action items from 12 June telecon  Action DB: Forward info about the FrontPage Accessibility Wizard to ER. Get   more info.  Action: everyone to comment on the charter before next meeting.  Action WC: propose to CG that ER meets with AU, UA, and WCAG on a monthly   rotation such that ER has one joint meeting per month and 3 solo meetings.   Progress: Sent note to WCAG WG chairs first.  Action WC, CR, MC, BM think more about how to save state information during   an evaluation session. Put on the agenda for the 17 July meeting.    Open action items from the AU/ER face2face  Action:MC propose definitions of blocks  Action:CMN ask the internationalization interest group about readability   indicies in other languages, e.g. Fog Index or style/grammar checkers.  Action:GR ask people who do mathematics on the web to find out combinations   of elements that would trigger that this is a math equation or logic   expression.  Action:DD continue exploring OCR field that can do anything to recognize   that there is text.  Action:WC add HTML MAP technique for grouping links to AERT.

Status and report on Action items: Refer to June 12 minutes:  2. We've had some good discussion on 12.3 . Lets see if we can pin down a   bottom line consensus. Issues include:  In SELECT: use OPTGROUP when count count of OPTIONS exceeds threshold?  In FORM: use FIELDSET when count of elements within form (INPUT, TEXTAREA,   SELECT, BUTTON, OBJECT ) exceeds threshold? When two or more radio buttons   have same name?.  sentences.. when to break up... possible counts include verbs, words, clauses  paragraphs... when to break up...    Open Action Items  WC There are several open items from last week as well as some from the   f2f. still have several. Michael, Gregory, Cynthia do as well. None of them   are here today.  /* action items still open are listed in the Summary of action items at the   beginning of this document. */    12.3  CR What is a large block? How big is too big? For a sentence, a list, etc.   If you have a list with > 10 items is that too big.  WL depend on context.  WC List of states. Don't break that up if ask for area code.  WL But if list original 13 colonies. Author choice.  WC But, we need a trigger number to suggest to the author that chunking   might need to occur.  LK When you look at a page where it is not obvious how big each list is.  WL What is industry practice? Is it what will fit on one unscrolled screen?  DB Somtimes.  BM That's the IBM idea, everything should fit on one page.  HB We do that with hyperlinks.  LK All of the info plus headings. Headings allow you to scan and can dig in   deeper where you are drawn to.  WC #'s we have come from numbers of buttons on a phone (10) and chunks of   info can keep in short-term memory (7 +/- 2). Was there more research this   was based on? Should we do more?  WL What does this have to do with accessibility?  CR Cognitive and blindness/low vision.  DB Tables of contents? Any page?  WC all kinds of things. perhaps clarify. i'm mostly talking lists.  CR in sentences, no more than 2 verbs.  WC This is a checkpoint of WCAG, thus we can't decide here why to trigger   (an accessibility issue or not), but how to trigger. Concerned about   references. Where did CMN's suggestion come from? Want to back these claims up.  LK trigger on any document.  CR problem with checks that appear all the time is that people ignore them.  DB Long sentences is least of our worries, numbers of links on a page is   more of an issue. We can suggest ways you can count.  WC We need to collect references to resources. Word does grammar checks.  WL Collection be useful to someone making a tool.  Action WC: dig up references for writing comprehension.  WC rant on HFWeb tool for eye-tracking. need for data. use of patterns.   could use a tool to compare eye-tracking and structure.  Action WC: send eyetracking tool info to list.  LK did they look at the effect of the task? that might have an effect.  WC lots of open issues.  LK consensus that a tool should count number of options in a list, etc. and   offer a threshold for these things?  Resolved: we can suggest that a tool should count the number of options in   a list, etc. and offer a threshold for length. Not all tools need to do   this, and we don't have consensus on the lengths to specify.  CR write up the things we are checking for and put in the document. "We are   checking sentences for length, we are looking at ... "  WC Yes, that's how we've been doing it. Keep the issues inline.  LK Flicker is another one, i've talked with a neurosurgeon who said it was   more than flicker rater, but size, color, other motion. There is a whole   text book.  Action LK: get reference of book re: info of seizures and flicker.  WL many of the current presentation "semantics" are based on what's   fashionable. E.g. McDonald's painting restaurants a certain color to   stimulate hunger. Last year's fashionable is this year's horror.    Next meeting  July 3 - those of us who can, will.  No meeting on July 10, since meet with AU on the 11th.  Aim to publish another public draft in July, probably week of July 24.    $Date: 2000/06/26 16:16:49 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      I took an action item at the 14 February telecon to ask WCAG if text   equivalents for audio needed to be on a separate page or could they be   included in the current page.    we determined that the current page is fine.    here is the exchange including the proposed wording to add to the WCAG   Techniques document.  note that there were a couple e-mails after this but   it was just Geoff and Charles agreeing this was o.k.  I will give it a   couple more days on the list before I incorporate the changes to ERT as   well as the WCAG techniques document, in case anyone disagrees on WCAG.    --wendy        >If people agree that this is an o.k. thing to do, then we would include it   >in the techniques document.

        I don't think earl:result is a subProperty of DC.Relation.conformsTo since   they define it [1] as, "A reference to an established standard to which the   resource conforms."   I think this is similar to earl:testcase without the   detail (confidence, validity) of earl:result.    I expect people can use conformsTo to make a simple conformance claim along   the lines of:  <meta name="DC.Relation.conformsTo"   content="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1A-Conformance">    At the DC2002 meeting, I was hoping that people could use conformsTo to   point to EARL, e.g.:  <meta name="DC.Relation.conformsTo" content="http://example.org/mypage.earl"/>  but now I'm not sure if that is appropriate since   http://example.org/mypage.earl is not an "established standard"...it is the   metadata defining how the resource conforms to an established standard.    Suppose we can tweak it that way?  --wendy    [1] from http://purl.org/dc/terms/  <rdf:Property rdf:about="&dctermsns;conformsTo">       <rdfs:label xml:lang="en-US">conforms to</rdfs:label>       <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-US">A reference to an established standard   to which the resource conforms.</rdfs:comment>       <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="&dcns;relation"/>       <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="&dctermsns;"/>       <dcterms:issued>2001-05-21</dcterms:issued>       <rdfs:seeAlso          rdf:resource="http://www.dublincore.org/usage/decisions/#2001.01"/>     </rdf:Property>    At 02:39 PM 10/29/02, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Is earl:result a subProperty of DC.relation.conformsto ?

      Hello,    The Working Draft "Requirements for WCAG 2.0" has been published as a W3C   Technical Report at: http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/    Good work everyone,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/02/12-minutes.html    12 February 2001 ER WG Telecon Minutes  Summary of action items and resolutions  ?       Resolved: Check for point size and suggest don't use. Instead use a   relative unit of measure, ala WCAG.  ?       Resolved: Will look at properties for assertions such as   "exists/doesn't exist" , "should exist or should not exist.", "qualify/does   not qualify." which is basically "valid/not valid" or having one property   that can take one of the following values:   needs/doesn't-need/unchecked/appropriate/inappropriate/suggested"  ?       Resolved: Will propose to WCAG and AU to discuss at the face to   face joint meeting the idea of scales for rating conformance to checkpoints.  ?       Action: Chris will minute the next meeting.  Participants  Chris, Len, William, Harvey, Wendy  Point size  CR WCAG says that point size must be flagged.  LK That's what it says. Propose that ER adopt WCAG. It is clear in WCAG.  WC Reason that specify relative no matter where specified, is so that   people just can't easily turn it off but want to increase the font size and   have the layout adjust to fit.  /* Discuss sections 6.1 and 5.2.6 of CSS1 spec. */  Resolved: Check for point size and suggest don't use. Instead use a   relative unit of measure, ala WCAG.  EARL  LK Reactions to how EARL is going? It's mostly CMN, SP, and sometimes DB   and I talking about it. In terms of process, do you have suggestions.  CR Good to see progress.  LK Are people buried or is there something we can do to make the dialog   more appetizing?  CR It's fairly complex. A practical example, a program that would do   something so that people could play with it, would make it easier to grasp.  LK A while back CMN and I talked about WAVE outputting some EARL and Amaya   inputting it. Nothing has happened with that. Also talk about putting this   in a framework where you could have automated reasoning, to make some   inferences.  CR How would you view the results? Some images require a longdesc and some   do not, if you wanted to see which images on a page require longdesc and   the results stored in EARL how would you view?  LK You have an EARL file. You have a program...how would it do it in   A-prompt? It would give you wizard boxes with image and place for longdesc.   If you have a program that would do that, what is the information it needs?  WL It needs to know where the author believes it needs a londesc. Can say   insert longdesc here or put in following phrase, "image does not need   longdesc."  CR Give it a file, need longdesc, yes/no. When run through tool can say,   "this image needs longdesc or not."  LK How refer?  CR How handled in EARL? How refer to it later? What if it is in another file?  LK In Sean's e-mail, "first crack..." Tool needs to know who asserted it,   what the image is, what the file is.  WC could say x:person assert y - that image needs a longdesc.  LK Don' thave the last part.  WC Is it a comment or detail? Problem is, need more detail in the examples.  LK Perhaps we need an EARL term "needs longdesc" or "needs alt." or more   generic "needs attribute." That's a defined EARL Term, then give the name   of the attribute.  WL THen have "does not warrant longdesc?"  LK Have "needs" "does not warrant" or "doesn't need." "Unchecked"  WC Want to assert, <Using the rule URI-from-WCAG-technology-specific [image   x] "needs/doesn't-need/unchecked/ok"> doesn't-need and ok are both "ok"   states, but one in that it doesn't need it in the other it's been provided.  CR Per document basis. In one document may need longdesc, in another might not.  LK There are some sites that have a logo that would be interesting to hear   described once.  WL Take an iconic photograph of the raising of flag over iwojima. The   longdesc is different depending on use. If analyzing shadows vs use in history.  WC Assertions at object level and at context level.  WL Several assertions per each level. Can't carry all of the annotations   with everything. Take the bible more annotations than passages. I'm leary   of too many "needs/doesn't need/could use" etc.  LK OK doesn't handle provided but inappropriate.  WC Could have appropriate and inappropriate instead of OK.  HB Different checks for different places.  WL Right.  LK Another property, "Should-be." Person going through review could make a   recommendation as to what an attribute should be.  WL Wherever you got the image from, could carry such a thing. I vote that   we stick with 4 and go on.  WC Don't need to limit it to 4, currently have:   "needs/doesn't-need/unchecked/appropriate/inappropriate/should-be"  LK Appropriate - exists ok. inappropriate - exists but doesn't qualify.  HB Prefer suggest to should-be.  LK Ok.  WL This apply to a whole lot of things other than images.  LK Yes. Titles, objects, etc.  WL The summary of tables.  LK If we want to be technology-specific, we've been talking about attribute.  WL Or more than one element.  LK Apply to an attribute of an element (longdesc) or content of element   (object). Needs means it doesn't exist, but should. Not-needed means it   doesn't need to exist and doesn't exist. One case we haven't covered is   where it doesn't need to exist but does. Are there any cases where putting   an optioanl element is bad.  WC There could be a rule set that would keep track of Jaws oddities, like   how it handles alt and title that could be confusing. In which case someone   might want to be warned.  LK A rule database for JAws.  WL One for IE 5.5 vs 4.7 to see what style sheet attributes are implemented.  LK Could imagine a page where lots of images and the longdesc is helpful   and in the others it is useless. Someone who is blind read the worthless   longdesc then read another longdesc and get tired of reading the longdesc.   Then they miss the useful longdesc. This is theoretical since no one uses   longdesc.  WL What about more complex elements like object?  LK What do you think is missing?  WL They contain applets. Is the language that that the applet written in   accessible? Fundamentally, if get a good set could be used to address object.  HB Object remains in limbo in HTML world.  LK I've never seen a page that uses object.  WL Don't know what browser supports.  CR Can convert applet to ojbect. Will work on IE on Win. If running on mac,   get an applet since doesn't support. A script at beginning of page that   loads correct.  LK Another way to cut the pie is to have an attribute "exists/doesn't   exist" another one that says "should exist or should not exist."  WL Then need "qualify/does not qualify." It should exist, it does exist,   but the one that's there isn't any good.  LK Have several variables that can appear in different combinations. You   either take all of the combinations and make a value or take the individual   ones. Every time I look at needs/not needs I have to translate. Independent   of how we describe it, do we have all of the semantics that we want?  WC Might reflect the process better. i.e. one tool automatically check if   alt exists or not, up to the human or another tool to determine if   appropriate or not.  LK When we say so and so says such and such, split human versus machine.  WC For now, but hope that some human checks be machine checkable in future.  WL Seems logical to me. Take all of those things where can conceive of   something and then bring to life. We know whether we can check for   attributes and most of those we already have in place.  LK We can tweak the vocabulary more, have we covered all of the semantics   we want to express?  WC At this point, "exists/doesn't exist" , "should exist or should not   exist.", "qualify/does not qualify." which is basically "valid/not valid"  WL Not all are yes or no.  LK Need a rating scale?  WC Also "suggested." A rating scale...would need an algorithm to help   someone decide.  LK When I rate a site, I do wind up saying stuff like this. "that gets by,   but it could be better."  WC qualify/not qualify/kinda qualifies with a suggestion.  LK Like jumbo and extra large, which is bigger? Rather have a number. If   EARL is general evaluation rather than "can i put a AA stamp on it." there   are shades of grey, such as "how usable is the site." You'll have people   who have never been on an ER call who can say "usable" or "this stinks" or   whatever.  WL No doubt that you have to have a scale. Not on whether there or not, but   anything that requires human judgement, that's what human judgement means -   scaling and rating.  WC What's the scale and gradations?  WL 7 + or - 2.  LK Analogy to CSS, x-large, large, medium, etc. Could have different scales.  WL If you have any human comments, count on a scale.  WC Verbosity, appropriateness, lots of scales. degrees of each.  WL Appropriateness on different scales - technical languages use, etc.  LK In questionnaire land they reduce to good or bad on the 2 ends although   they phrase it differently. A scale is a rating method.  WL Then we get to pick vectors. Perhaps they tie in with checkpoints. If   you have a checkpoint that says clear and simple then you have clarity   barometer and simple barometer. Then the tool that we design has the   purpose to evalute on the axis specified by the checkpoint.  WC reads from latest WCAG 2.0 techniques.  WL Those are instructions to give to person doing the evaluation.  LK Out of compliance model from 1.0.  WL Talking about expanding check/no check to 7 +/- 2 level. This is close   to simple enough so i give it a 4.  LK What is happening to compliance?  WC Nothing yet. Not sure where to put priorities.  LK This raises a problem for WCAG, should scales play a role in WCAG?  WL Right, an issue. There is no such thing as Level 2 1/2 A. The   checkpoints themselves in the new ones are abstract and that essentially   demands scalarization. Have to say if something is clear in the context for   this audience. That's why these tools might help push in that direction. If   we are commissioned to make a tool to determine if the checkpoints have   been followed we need leeway. You have specified something that requires   scales (by the phrase "for this audience). Is therefore different for   another audience.  WC Propose that this be the main agenda topic for the AU/ER/WCAG meeting at   the F2F.  LK Yes.  WC Currently it's all or nothing. Need gradation.  HB Here are the checkpoints I meet.  WC Use EARL to make the claim as to which checkpoints you've followed.  WL Need a gestalt index.  LK Overall usability. When you pick up popular website of the week magazine   they talk about content and usable.  WL Why don't they have accessibility included there? It's not on the radar   in so many places.  WC Accessibility or usability? Are you saying that we need to begin to make   the bridge from our end to get accessibility included?  WL It's a superset not a subset.  LK Current philosophy is that it's a subset or something different. Can   have a AA site that may not be usable.  LK We've come out with a bunch of properties, we might want to rearrange.   we've also gotten into the issue with scales.  WL Use joint meeting to arrive at some agreement on fact of scalable   paramteres. Already picked some that need it. Also need to be tested. To   write up a checkpoint that is not testable is to not write a checkpoint at all.  LK Another real issue is there are practical objections to putting in   accessibility. For example, something may endanger intellectual property or   really hard to do. We wind up handling then in ad hoc ways. Shall we build   into EARL a mechanism for including objections?  WL Bet you have to have a joint meeting with EO. Deals with outside agency   saying it's too much trouble. That's EO.  LK It comes up in WCAG. e.g. minimize distractions. instead say "don't do"   it was minimize. If said don't do, be too many objections.  WL Purpose of banner ad is to distract.  LK Something where external consideration found way into checkpoint.  WL Started out with flicker.  WC But it's been hard to measure.  LK Discussion of compliance and consider these expectations.  Next meeting  Chris will minute.    $Date: 2001/02/12 17:56:41 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

        Chris,    Thanks.  This raises some good questions and issues.    1. We need to figure out how to combine AERT with the current HTML   Techniques draft [1].  Or will we have two documents?  Also, keep in mind   the relation to ATAG and ATAG Techniques [2].  2. How will we handle overlap of techniques?  For example, you have   technique 3.5.1 "Check document for header nesting" associated with   checkpoint 3.1, but these might also be relevant to checkpoint 1.3 "Make   all content and structure available independently of presentation."  3. I'm curious how you sorted the techniques into Levels.  There are some   WCAG 1.0 priority 1 techniques in Level 2, Minimum Level are primarily WCAG   1.0 priority 2.  If this sorting is correct, then people who conform to   WCAG 1.0 will be a bit confused when they move to WCAG 2.0.  (the next two questions are from your document)  4. What is a major section and what is a long document?  5. Can valid long documents be devoid of paragraphs?  This might relate to the applicability axis we talked about at last   Thursday's telecon.    --w    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/wcagtech020320.html#text  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/#Deliverables    At 02:00 PM 2/25/2003, Chris Ridpath wrote:    >I've created a (very) rough draft of the techniques for guideline 3.1  >(navigable) and posted it at:  >http://www.aprompt.ca/TechniquesDraft1.html  >  >This is really just the techniques from the AERT that seem to fit the new  >3.1 guideline.

        The holy grail in testing tools seems to be an automatic test for flicker   that could be dangerous for someone with photosensitive epilepsy.    Does anyone know of a tool that tests for flicker?  Does anyone have ideas about how this would be done automatically?  Are any of the developers on this list interested in working on something?    This is related to WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 7.1 [1]  Information on photosensitive epilepsy.

      How are the general reviews of ERT coming along?  I have not seen any   comments sent to the list.    At the 3 January meeting [1] we decided to publish our first public working   draft in mid-February. To make that deadline we determined that  1. everyone needed to review the ERT in its entirety,  2. we would collect open issues,  3. clean up major issues as best we could before publishing a public   working draft (rather than internal working drafts that are public.)    Len sent e-mail last week asking for an intermediate draft before the   Feburary goal.    I propose that:    1. people review the document and send general comments to the list by next   monday's meeting (24 January).  2. I will publish an open issues list on Tuesday (25 January).  3. Chris and I will incorporate editorial comments and release another   working draft on Friday (28 January).  4.  Open issues will be on the agenda for the meeting on 31 January.  5. I will update the open issues list on Tuesday 1 February  6. Chris and I will published an updated internal working draft on friday,   4 February.  7. open issues will be discussed on monday 7 february.  8. at the 14 February meeting determine if we want to make the 18 February   draft public.    therefore, we could start the following pattern:  Tuesdays: open issues updated.  Fridays: new working draft posted.  Mondays: discuss open issues and evaluate how close we are to going public.    and then every 3 months take the most current working draft public.    thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000103.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello,    In order for me to have a chance to keep up with the issues on the mailing   list, in the future could you please:    1. Look for existing issues in the open issues list that relate to your   current concern.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html  or  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues-sorted.html  2. If you find something similar, please include the issue number in the   subject of your e-mail.  3. If you do not find something similar, please include "NEW" in the   subject of your e-mail.  I will then add the new issue to the mailing list.    Also, if at all possible, if you are attempting to summarize an issue   please put "summary" in the subject of your e-mail.  It would help if   people attempted to summarize the discussion  from time to time.  I do try   to read every single message to this list, but y'all are a busy   group!  It's hard to keep up!  Especially to tease out the nuances of each   issue.  Any help you all can provide would be appreciated!!    This policy might grow a bit, but this should at least help get us   started.  Suggestions are welcome.    I have looked into bugzilla, a bug-tracking tool, since that could help   automate the process.  It didn't seem flexible enough.  UA has their own   tool, that seems simple and easy to use. But again, not sure how flexible   it is. Any suggestions?    Thank you and be well,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

        Can we simply say, "These guidelines provide recommendations to developers   and managers who wish to make Web content more accessible and usable by   people with disabilities."    In other words, remove the adjectives and simply say "people with   disabilities."  Later, we can enumerate the types and combinations of   disabilities or leave it to the EOWG documents.    --wendy    At 07:16 PM 11/5/2003, Gregg Vanderheiden wrote:    >I think the objective was to say that the guidelines are meant to apply to   >people with all different types of disabilities.

        I agree that we do not want to reinforce the notion that WCAG only applies   to HTML and need to be careful with our examples.  The Techniques Gateway   should be a high-level discussion about making content accessible and I   don't think it should include technology-specific examples.  Instead of   talking about how to use the alt attribute on the image element, we should   discuss how to write a text equivalent for a variety of images used in a   variety of contexts.    Although the current draft of the Techniques Gateway [1] has several   HTML-specific examples, refer to the editorial notes scattered through the   document: "This paragraph is HTML-specific. Need broader range of examples,   or more generic explanation."  Each of those editorial notes is a to-do for   the editor to generalize the concept so that it is not HTML-specific.    If I interpret the consensus of the Techniques Task Force correctly, I   think the vision of the Gateway is:  After each general discussion we will link to a list of relevant   techniques.  For example, after the text equivalents discussion in the   Gateway, we'll have several links into the HTML Techniques (e.g., using alt   on image, using the object element), SVG Techniques (e.g., using the title   and desc elements with the g element), etc.  But we will not have HTML   examples included in the discussion of text equivalents in the Gateway.  I   think that we can ban HTML examples in the general discussion because there   will be plenty of HTML-specific discussion in the HTML Techniques.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-GATEWAY-20031205.html    At 06:21 PM 12/19/2003, Loretta Guarino Reid wrote:    >Sailesh,  >  >   This seems ok as long as it is clear that the HTML technique is only an  >example.

        Hello,    new draft published at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/sources/wd-wcag2-tech-req    For discussion at today's call.    --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      Hello,    Len Kasday raised the following issue regarding technique 3.5.1 in the 21   December draft [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-19991221.html  ]:  <blockquote>  | 1. The first header element in the document must be H1  | 2. There must be only one H1 element in the document    LRK:: Why only one H1? It isn't part of the HTML4 spec , as far as I can   see in http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.5.5    LRK:: HTML4 also allows skipped levels. The spec merely says  "Some people consider skipping heading levels to be bad practice. They   accept H1 H2 H1 while they do not accept H1 H3 H1 since the heading level   H2 is skipped."  We should point out that we don't skip levels because of accessibility reasons.    So actually we have a problem with WCAG: it doesn't define "and use them   according to specification".  </blockquote>    The techniques for WCAG do not say that a document must only have one H1   element.  Thus, I believe we can get rid of this assertion in the ERT.    The HTML Techniques for WCAG says, "Since some users skim through a   document by navigating its headings, it is important to use them   appropriately to convey document structure. Users should order heading   elements properly. For example, in HTML, H2 elements should follow H1   elements, H3 elements should follow H2 elements, etc. Content developers   should not "skip" levels (e.g., H1 directly to H3). Do not use headings to   create font effects; use style sheets to change font styles."    I propose the following rewording:  <blockquote>  Technique 3.5.1 [priority 2] Check document for header nesting  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Header elements (H1-H6) should be checked to ensure they are nested   according to the following rules  Header levels must not increase by more than 1 level. Example: H2 following   H1 is good. H3 following H1 is bad.  Header elements can decrease by any level. Example: H2 following H5 is OK.    Example of a message to be displayed:  Improper header nesting: Header levels must not increase by more than one   level per heading.  Do not use headings to create font effects; use style   sheets to change font styles.    Repair Technique:  Allow user to modify the header numbering within the document.    Test Files and Discussion Files:  Link to test file for this technique.  </blockquote>  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Technique 9.4.1 [priority 3] Check for "tabindex" attributeDiscussion    Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Check the following elements for a "tabindex" attribute:  A  AREA  BUTTON  INPUT  OBJECT  SELECT  TEXTAREA  Example Language:  Create a logical tabbing order through this page.  Some people like to skip   over site navigation bars that appear at the top of each page in a   site.  To allow someone to tab over it, set the tab order of the page such   that the navigation bar one of the last objects.  Repair Technique:  Show the author a list of all of the active elements and their current tab   order.  Allow them to change the order either by changing the number of the   tabindex or dragging and dropping an object to where it ought to appear in   the list.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Hello Kerstin,    I think that checkpoint 2.1 (All functionality is operable at a minimum   through a keyboard or a keyboard interface) [1] and its required success   criterion address part of this issue - "Ensure that menus and other   navigation controls can be operated." I'm not sure about the other piece,   "without causing form submission or screen changes."  I think it is implied   that if you design something to work with a keyboard or keyboard interface   it ought to work *well* but we might want to be more explicit. Perhaps a   second success criterion that says, "operating the functionality through a   keyboard or keyboard interface works in a way that is logical for the   keyboard user."  I'm not sure how to make this less subjective ("is logical   for the keyboard user" is not testable), but here's a starting point if we   think we want to go in this direction.    Are these [2] the NFB guidelines you are referring to?    Thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#keyboard-operation  [2] http://www.nfb.org/tech/webacc.htm    At 12:31 AM 6/26/2003, Kerstin Goldsmith wrote:    >Hi,  >  >Question: the NFB put together a list of guidelines for the web, and one   >of them seems quite pertinent;  I know that we have run into it in several   >ways, and it's definitely disorienting for a vision-impaired user.

      hello,    new draft: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-20000307.html    as always, the latest is available from http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/    There are lots of @@'s since Len noted some changes he made.  There were   also several open issues from before.  Please focus on commenting on those   items.    Also note that I added two levels of table of contents.  I have not yet   added the "next section" and "previous section" buttons.  the to do list   has all of the to do's but this one.

      Hello all,    As I incorporate Andi's and Lisa's suggested edits into a new draft of the   reformulation (stay tuned), it seems that a few checkpoints are primarily   addressing pages of content rather than applications.  For example,   "Provide an overview or summary of highly structured materials, such as   tables and groups of user interface controls."    To me, "highly structured materials" implies objects that have been   included in a page.  While I agree that summaries are important for tables   of data, I don't know that a "summary" is needed for every group of form   controls.  The "fieldset" and "legend" are ways in XHTML/HTML to provide   contextual and grouping information for a group of controls.  This is   usually enough. I have not seen a case where a summary is needed nor can I   think of one.  Has anyone run into a group of form controls for which they   needed a summary?  It would not surprise me that one exists, but I do not   believe this is the norm.  Also, how would you provide a summary on a group   of form controls in XHTML?    Why is it that a summary is needed for tables and not groups of form   controls?  Frankly, I think it's because of the lack of tools being used to   navigate tables.  Navigating forms has been widely available for a while.   Navigating tables is still a new thing to people.  Therefore, I may need a   map to help me get through the table.  This is primarily because tables can   be navigated on a number of axes whereas forms are pretty straightforward.    Beyond XHTML/HTML and the page paradigm, should it become a common   programming practice to provide a summary for a group of controls in an   applet or a full-fledged application?  In Java, you can add an   "accessibleDescription" to any object.  This means that if you have created   a group of objects, they collectively become an object that you could   attach a description to.  This description could be a summary.   I think   the same argument applies to the Java app as to the XHTML page: if there   are a number of axes in which to navigate an object and that navigation is   not straightforward, a summary can act as a map to help the user   through.  However, for most applications, I think a summary is overkill.    Therefore, I propose:  1. In regards to this specific checkpoint, we do not require that all   groups of user interface objects have a summary.  2. We create an open issue to discuss which objects/elements/widgets should   have summaries.  3. We create an open issue and discuss when summaries are required versus   when they are recommended versus when they are a good thing to do.  4. In general, we need to keep applications and other technologies in   mind.  It is easiest to think in terms of pages of XHTML since that is what   we know best.  Others have raised this and I know we are aware, but I am   sending a friendly reminder. <grin>    Thoughts?  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Present: Chris, William, Harvey, Wendy    HB Is there any means of certifying metadata? If we are going to make   assertions, should we include certifications of metadata on a document.    WL Pics?  Since we are proposing EARL for that function, is META the place   to put it...    HB Looking at DC, they have a typed vocabulary.  Since PICS is a W3C Rec...    WL Often proposed a place to include certifications.    HB Open-ended?    WL Yes, more general than pornography although that's what it has been most   associated with.  Freedom of speech issues made people pull back, but it   had good stuff. It may be that you provide EARL similarly to logo, where it   validates it.    HB Hope that we could get to the point that someone doesn't have to assert   that a doc complies or doesn't.    WL Not have to but get to.  Is there any way to say "A, AA, etc." logo, but   it doesn't link, that's the assertion.    WC We have a PICS schema, refer to #7 in the Errata.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA    WL Do user agents do anything with it?    WC Don't think so.    WL This should be in a new version, no one will use it.  Ridiculous that   can't incorporate a spelling mistake.    WC Talk with judy. Have discussed. Decided not to pursue 1.1, since so many   changes needed. Instead move forward with 2.0.    HB agree.    WL Will take too much time.  Why not release a version with errata   incorporated?

      Chris,    I am responding on the list since I assume others will be interested in   this info as well.    The subgroup isn't yet focused on how to check the accessibility of server   generated pages, but first how to generate pages in an accessible   way.  Since we have to provide tests for checkpoints they will be thinking   about this eventually and in conjunction with ERT WG.    There is a subgroup in WCAG that discussed these issues at the f2f in   October.

          http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/09/20-minutes.html    20 Sept 2001 minutes    Present  ?       Jo  ?       Wendy  ?       Tim  ?       Loretta  ?       Jason  ?       Katie  ?       Gregg    Regrets  ?       Matt  ?       Charles    Issues  This discussion is based on the Big issues. 19 Sept 2001 - Gregg   Vanderheiden e-mail list of issues raised at the 10/11 Sept F2F meetings.  GV Only posted the 3 documents yesterday. Since not enough time to review,   perhaps leave discussion until next week. Are there other big issues we can   generate? Perhaps we can put some of them to bed. Anne said that it didn't   seem like a number of the big issues were addressed by the consensus items.  JW We need to reach the point where we can draft a conformance and priority   scheme.  GV As I look at the list of issues..."what is an equivalent" is #4. Can we   sort out those that deal with conformance and priorities and go for those   first? As I look at them, they all seem to relate to priorities. I would   like to start at the top and walk down the list to see if we have a   nomination for something to work from. OR is there a question to answer   before we tackle - i.e. a work item to tackle before moving forward.  KHS Baseline capabilities.  LGR Would like Cynthia here for this discussion.  JW Baseline tightly coupled with technology-specifics.  LGR Content developer needs to know what is reasonable to assume. then   someone assumes "latest and greatest" then ok as long as they say that?  JW That's one position they could adopt. Would not be good for   interoperability.  GV The consensus statement is: Techniques should specifiy if particular   browsers are needed.  JW Or particular support for a particular standard. e.g. CSS2 vs CSS1.  GV Another stab, "Techniques should specifiy if particular browsers are   needed or specify particular technologies. e.g. you must have CSS2 support   for this technique."  JW Yes, gives people choice how far back they want to take backwards   compatibility.  GV If a company says, "i have to work back to Netscape Communicator 2",   they can't use CSS, etc.  JW Unless they transform gracefully.  GV They can't depend on CSS for default presentation. We used to have an   assumption that if accessible via lYnx that is good.  JM I don't think anyone is saying "we want the site to support NS2" but   lynx seems reasonable. This brings us back to Cynthia's original question   (re: client-side scripting).  GV Her question is, "accessible as long as support client-side scripting."   or can't you assume scripting?  JM I don't want to put words into her mouth, but we have not made a   statement about if site should work with javascript off, or unsupported.  JW Could be asked for SVG, SMIL, etc. We're plannig techniques for all of   those. Therefore, content developer have to make a choice whether to   support or not based on how inclusive they want to be.  GV Do we think that pages should be accessible with browser that do not   support scripting?  JM If the decision is that we won't make a decision and give them   techniques for them to make their choices, we need to state that explicitly.  GV If we leave it to the dev, we have made a decision. Implies, requiring   scripts is ok.  WC We might want to do some research.  JW I think that devs should be aware of the consequences of either option.   If require them, there are a variety of UAs that won't support them or   turne doff for security. Therefore, limiting audience in some way. I'm a   bit worried about mobile devices which don't have many resources.  WC WAPScript. Need to do some research.  GV Then deciding all users must support scripting in their browser.  WC Raman's client-side proxy that will interpret client-side scripts.  JW Then this issue will disappear for certain types of issues. Still issue   with if we want to impose that assumption across technologies. Make   decisions about when or not people will use.  JM What type of research, Wendy?  WC Similar to survey sent out about a year ago, but sent to wider audience,   perhaps ask help from organizations in disability community. Also needs to   bedesigned to get feedback from non-technical, e.g. test page and ask for   results.  JW Can't have in normative, since changing all the time.  WC "until user agents", although bain of existence for 1.0, was helpful in   that it separated those things that authors had to do forever, from those   that they wouldn' thave to do once user agents or other types of clients   support. This distinction is helpful, although not sure how to address.  GV If write for the future, today some pages will be inaccessible. Perhaps   we should do that. Let's argue the point to discuss. I'm not convinced   myself. No matter what we do with the guidelines, some people will not be   able to things. If we write with until user agents, it gets complicated:   who decides when true? instead if we say, "these do not desribe everything   you can do to make accessible" put in the techniques. In techniques say,   "you can use scripts, and call pages accessible, but there are some people   who won't be able to use it." Here are more things you can do...it will be   more straightforward than until user agents. We can say, "this is a   reasonable set" and people should program pages to it and assistive tech   and user agents should build to it. Things will get more accessible over time.  JW With our guidelines as they stand we don't need to address the issue   there since the guidelines are not technology-specific. The techniques are   and that's where the problem is dealt with. There are different ways of   doing it. What I had in mind, was to state the assumptions on each   technique as to what support it required. PRovide informative info   elsewhere. Keep that info up to date.  GV Technology-specific checkpoints are normative, techniques are   informative. Put in techniques and are all right.  JW Yes, thought we had decided that long ago.  GV This works if people use all three pieces. The only hitch, is that some   people are only looking at normative info. If normative says, "I can use   scripts." then they will only do that. Won't dig to find that page should   be used w/out.  JW Don't put it in techniques, put it own document or annotated version of   the technology-specific document.  GV But they are only looking at the normative docs.  JW Normative says, "do a or b, or do a, or b and c" and "a requires support   for X and b does not require support for x" then they make that decision on   what they think is supported.  JM Give them as much supporting material as possible. I see the rationale   of removing from normative, but many people will not go beyond it. I   predict that when 2.0 replaces 1.0, there will be articles that say "what's   new." In 1.0 they will say, "script usable when turned off in 1.0, in 2.0   no longer needed." therefore, we have effectively said, "go wild with   javascript."  JW It would be unworkable to have that info in a normative doc.  WC Could look at W3C process for publishing update. Updates have been done   for errors, but WCAG is reflecting current state of the art which is a new   situation for W3C.  GV Isn't this just "until user agents" in different clothing? Now we're   saying "there's a technique you have to do but you can't do this unless   these technologies are supported."  JW It's different. Previously we didn't spell out the techniques as   alternatives as clearly as we could.  GV If we say "do a, or b, or c" if someone comes up with "d" then they   won't conform.  WC Gregory proposed this, as did GV, that there would always be "d" that   would outline the intent of the "rule" and that the content developer would   have to document what they did.  GV Yes, that's right.  GV Moving back to the list, what was the meaning of "2. User literacy level"?  KHS The reading level of the audience. It's a cynthia thing. Along the   lines of education.  JM I was asking if anything had been decided on it.  WC CS concerned that 3.3 require a minimum reading level, is very much against.  JW I wouldn't call it a big issue, but that this issues is one example of a   larger one. Can you design content to be comprehensible with less and less   assumptions of the abilities of the user. You need to determine when to   stop. How much to invest and how far to go.  JM More of 3.4.  JW 3.3. and 3.4. These are the most controversial.  WC Basically, the issue is "where do you draw the line?" You can't reach   100% of the audience, how can we help authors determine where to draw the line.  GV Big issues cover several checkpoints. "Differences by language" what   does that one mean?  KHS CMN issue?  JW Bidirectional issues with UA support. Subset of 1 and baseline capabilities.  GV Equivalents collapsed to 1.1.  JW related big issue - if anyone proposes to combine 3.4 and 1.1. The   question of whether to keep perception and conception requirments separate   and effect on conformance scheme.  GV Have something related to organization? Is the first set all perception?   guideline 1 also has structure. Structure important for cognition.  LRG This goes back to issues we agreed on. If we can't agree on things to   test/success criteria, then discussing if that should be in a separate   document or marked separately. Rather than zeroing in on cognition, then   look at what can test or not.  GV Yes. I thought one decision was not to claim conformance by disability.  JW This not necessarily by disability.  GV How doc is interpretted by non-tech people. Basically, we should write   as simply as possible. Therefore, can we agree on that?  JW Yes.  JM Links to definitions.  GV Implementation?  WC These discussions were minuted and perhaps we could look for   clarification there rather than trying to recreate them. Plus, we are over   5 minutes on the call and could clarify these on the list.  JW Were not minuted well. This is a good exercise.  GV I am pushing through to make sure we get these addressed.  * GV reads the rest of the list. All seem to be open.    $Date: 2001/09/20 21:38:55 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Hello,    On the ER IG/WG call today we discussed how to prevent an author from   receiving warnings for manual checks between sessions if the author has   already performed the manual check.  If a tool maintained results in meta   data for each file (or site) that is checked/repaired by a tool this would   be useful for a number of reasons:  1. generating conformance claims to WCAG  2. keeping track of what the user has yet to fix or has  fixed and thus   reducing the numbers of repeat alerts they may get for a particular element.    Have these issues been discussed in this group?  If so, please point us to   the resolutions.    thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Authoring Tool WG (AUWG),  Web Content WG (WCAG WG),  and WAI IG,    The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERWG) has been working on   the Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines [1].  This document describes techniques that Web   accessibility validation tools may use to evaluate the conformance of HTML   documents to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0). This   document also describes techniques that Web authoring tools may use to help   authors modify HTML documents to conform to WCAG 1.0. We anticipate that   tool developers may develop accessibility validation and/or repair modules   to be incorporated into commercial authoring tools, validation tools, and   perhaps user agents.    The ERWG believes this document is ready to be published as a public   working draft, but would like comments from AUWG, WCAG WG, and WAI IG   before moving forward.  This document still needs work - thus it is a   working draft.  You will notice several double at-signs (@@) throughout the   document which mark open issues, questions, and other to-do's.  There is   also a list of to-do's at the beginning of the document.  We would   appreciate comments on these as well as any other comments that you may have.    This review period will end Thursday, April 6 2000.  Please send review   comments before that date to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org.  Archives for this list   are at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/.

        Hello,    Here is an updated charter for review and discussion at our teleconference   today.  It is based on the charter that was approved last October [1]   and  incorporates changes required by the updated W3C process, in particular  the W3C Patent Policy [2].    When you read the charter, pay special attention to these sections:           * Milestones -- (required section) comments on planned schedule?           * Voting -- note clarifications           * Participation --                  1. Note the clarification on Good Standing and relationship                      to working group teleconferences for purposes of voting.                      One does not have to be in Good Standing to be listed as                      a contributor.                  2. Note the distinction between subscribing to the mailing   list                      and joining the group. An incomplete draft of a new "how to                      join" page is available [3].

      I took an action at the F2F to chase up markup languages for test   specification. I had vaguely recalled hearing something that NIST was   working on. Today in my searches, I quickly stumbled on the DOM test suite   markup language that Dimitris and others spoke of at the ERT/PF F2F at the   tech plenary last February.    Here is a bit about it in the FAQ.  http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/Documents/DOMTSFAQ.html#usingXML    Here's a message from Dimitris from May  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0067.html  that includes a DTD  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/att-0067/01-methods.dtd    He attended an ERT call on 28 May 2001  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001May/0094.html    I didn't catch it before, but now I realize how the DOM TS ML and EARL   compliment each other.  Charles saw it when he said, "CMN Difference is   instead of generating "pass or fail" you are generating EARL." during the   28 May telecon.      A wider search brought up the following abstracts.  TTCN-3 - A new Test Specification Language for Black-Box Testing of   Distributed Systems.  http://www.itm.mu-luebeck.de/english/publications/Abstract_ttcn-3.html  Towards the new Test Specification and Implementation Language 'TelCom TSL'  http://iamwww.unibe.ch/~rvswww/Publikationen/Grabowski/GI-ITG-1995/abstract.   html  And a paper:   http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cache/papers2/cs/16526/http:zSzzSzwww.itm.mu-lueb   eck.dezSzpublicationszSzttcn3zSzGrabowski.pdf/grabowski00ttcn.pdf    Test Specification DTD  This DTD defines the format for test specifiers which define component   tests and can be executed by the Test Pattern Verifier.  It describes the   tests as well as the results.  The end-to-end process is to verify   components so that they may be certified and then made available through a   component server.  http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/Research/SCL/Docs.html  Part of the SCL Component Test Bed Specification   http://xml.coverpages.org/scl.html    Interesting tangent: IMS has a language to report results of student   assessments.  Another possible use case for EARL, although they are already   using their own XML dialect.  http://www.imsproject.org/question/    "ADL, or the Assertion Definition Language, is a formal grammar for   describing the behavior of interfaces. This very general concept can be   applied to any interface for which the behavior can be described. The   purpose of this grammar is two-fold. First, it permits the translation of   the formal grammar into natural languages such as English and Japanese.   Second, it permits the automatic translation of the formal grammar into   tests that will evaluate the behavior of an implementation of the interface   being described. "  http://adl.opengroup.org/    Found a variety of sites, books, etc. devoted to Web testing methods and   definitions.  Investigating these further.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/03/01-f2f-minutes.html    Thanks to Jan who helped minute. Donovan also minuted, and I'll hopefully   be incorporating his notes soon.    Minutes from Friday's WCAG meeting will be sent separately.    --w      01 March 2001 F2F meeting minutes (AU/ERT/WCAG)  The minutes for both the morning and afternoon sessions are contained in   this document. In the a.m. the AU WG and ERT WG met along with several   visitors. The p.m. session was a joint meeting between AU WG, ERT WG, WCAG   WG and visitors.    Summary of action items, resolutions, and open issues  ?       Resolved: WCAG Will consider EARL as basis for conformance. Places   this on the open issues lsit.  ?       Resolved: WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each   requirement can be referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test   results to be associated with it.  ?       Resolved: add to AU issue list: add requirement that tools import   EARL. note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear that EARL has   firmed up.  ?       Action CMN take issue about UA checking EARL statements about a   page to ERT and UA.  ?       Issue: implications on EARL as to how to express for UA.  ?       Resolved: WCAG will adopt those aspects of AERT into HTML   techniques that are relevant.  ?       Resolved: do this type of meeting again at a plenary like this.

Susan Lesch - W3C, review for WCAG    EARL  LK Language used to describe if web content is accessible. more general for   other types of testing. comes up with vocabulary that may be as wide as   possible. the examples that are canned deal with accessibility of web   pages. scenarios for uses of EARL /* link */ We want to get specific about   vocabulary.  LK In web accessibility, there are many places where the judgement has to   be made by a person. e.g. an image with alt-text. If you have an image of a   cow and the image is a horse, you need a person to recommend what the   alt-text should be.  LK 1st scenario - person gets a report. need way to combine comments from   various people or tools. compare results to one or more standards - in the   states such as 508 vs WCAG. Ideally, a language to translate between   standards. A corporation may have their own standards.  CS Discussion in WCAG of a conformance schema, what's that about?  CMN Instead of conformance to guidelines at level X, have finer-grained or   partial conformance. e.g., I use a mouthstick, there are 9 checkpoints in   UAAG that are critical to me but don't care about visual checkpoints. Can I   use this system to do that. one goal of using RDF, is to make sure you can   do that.  DD The 3 WAI guidelines are for web content, user agent, authoring tool -   what it means to be accessible for each. We have been good at specifying   conformance to each guideline. Each have checkpoints with priorities. There   is a conformance claim you make, Level A etc. (DD explains). In terms of   the accessibility report, we have a way to point into our spec that we can   directly reference. The problem is made complex by the requirement of human   judgement. We can not automate everything. If you co nsider SVG test suite   it is harder to point at testable assertion, but the test is look at   something - is the circle red. It is more objective at looking at assertion   but harder to point at what is the purpose of the test. This language will   have to take into account both kind of evaluation.  LK We have a problem of specifiying conformance in SVG, are there other   comments on that before we move on?  RN From the implementation side, if you break it into qualitative verus   quantitative, when we write tests, we have to document our requirements. I   would like to see a requirement based guidelines, where i can easily see   subjective or not. if quantitative i can write a test for that. otherwise,   what a space for comments or someone else to read.  LK For qualitative judements, in addition to a statement would you want a   scale?  RN feasible, but still human judgement. 1,2,3 can say qualitative. if p3   and qualitative, i may not have resources to do that. how do you get buy in   from the retail side. have to get it as easy as possible. get a quick hit.  CMN Two threads coming together: how do you test something against a test   suite. when we looked at this, rdf seemed a good pick since it let you deal   in things with URIs. if your test suite is 10K cases and each is a page,   and requires a human. as long as you have what needs to be done described   with a URI, then using RDF can say, "this conforms." ATAG gives tests for   how to determine conformance. 1. can you insert an image? 2. can you give   an equivalent? each has a URI.  LH Unlike accessibility standards, we don' thave a clear set of test   assertions. In practise, I synthesize those where implied. You extract a   doc fromt he spec which is test assertions. then you apply those same   processes to the intermediate document.  DD you create a test of chekcpoints?  LH You have to deduce them.  LK You can imagine a lang where each output statement refers to a   particular test, or imagine that it points to something more atomic then   derive if particular checkpoints are produced. You can say this image meets   checkpoitn 1.1 or alt-text exists. then you have another set of rules that   says, 1.1 is ... and in 508 it's ... i wonder if that would be aof   ofrmalizing that.  CMN In the toy that danbri and i made took advantage of that. we had atomic   tests with rules. if you meet all p1's then you meet the atomic test which   is wcag level A.  CS Would it be useful to create markup to define those standards? A way to   describe why want test and rules for what test against.  CMN The user interface is the key bit.  CS Some people will do it directly in XML with a text editor, some people   will want a GUI.  DD I would like to hear from lynn or lofton, we're not inventing something   new here. People have been working on results to tests. They were specific   to a testing technology or specific technology. OASIS has come up with XSLT   evaluation. The etc people have an ISO framework for presenting test   result. keep in mind there are specification of requirement.  LK As people bring up requirements, I want to list them here. Is there a   meta requirement.  CMN Derive a result from other results.  DD These look like requirements for harness rather than language.  RN The language has to generate a report. Also add, modify, delete and   change my report. I don't care what it does, what I want is a report that I   can hand to management. With 508, the coformance is up to each agency to   decide how they will handle it. It applies to corporations and companies.   No one wants a document, it can be supoenaed. You have to have a report.   Who are the players and the end result?  DDimitriadis In specifying DOM tests, the language is indpendent of adding   mechanisms to the test suite. You extend your test suite rather than the   language.  DD Have to be clear not to confuse the language (keep track of test   results) with pretty output. Another language is the language to express   the test. WIll find lots of same data in the result.  Lofton An ad hoc design for SVG work. Similar to test expression language   that NIST has done. It's simple XML grammar that encapsulates the test   purpose, the checkpoints (operator script). Descriptive prose on what you   should see, what should happen, how to issue pass/fail.  LR If you are doing conformance, when you test for it, it has to trace   itself back to a requirement in the spec. You are bound in scope to what   the spec says. Our test suites are based on the same philosphy. We have   test assertions (your checklist), then test purposes and cases. We   represent this in a DTD. Easy to add new tags. All tags have an   identification, purpose, owner, etc. Lots of identification info. You can   generate almost any kind of report you want. On the harness, you can always   view the source code, find the test requirement, link to that clause in the   spec. It's not like a formal language.  PJ The title EARL is what I thought we were working on, but when I hear   "test language" and "reporting lagnuage" I am concern about scope.  LK Testing is expansion of evaluation?  PJ test language is source of running the test. EARL says there is an URI   for the test thatmaps to a requirement. When we specify language of the   test, perhaps too low level. Want to make sure that things scale. Want to   scale at different points. if I have a checkpoint that syas "provide alt   for content." different ways to do it. can say do or don't vs. having test   id's for what i can do to validate.  LH I think the weakest point in our work is the expression of results. I've   seen everything from our earliest suites (a pad of paper), to work with DOM   where you get a visual highlighted result back (indicating pass/fail).   That's what itnerested me in this work. Not sure see the distinction   between evalution and report. Report is result of running evaluation.  LK Evaluation is something that could be read by an authoring tool as well   as particular report.  JT One way I envision this being used, if we have a number of different   evaluation tools and repair tools, a language to express what the authroing   tool evaluates and repairt, then can match up report with a repair tool   that repairs those pieces. Report could contain the EARL.  PJ Making conformance claims is different than results of tests.  CMN Testing is good for feedback on the spec.  DD Scenarios where person does not know how to fix, all you may know is   that hte browser has a problem. The repair info is valuable in others it is   irrelevant. Therefore separated in the language.  DDimitriadis Description of test could be x language y technologies. We   want one eval language, so yes separate. While specifying DOM, if write   atomic tests, e.g. I want to test 1.2.3 it is easy to do a conformance   rating. You generate result then put indication on result. We would like to   have scenario driven tests, "a user wants to add 5 lines of text and change   the screen, etc." Can not express is atomic points. Therefore, output   language probably not output. Put this on the agenda. Capture things based   on prose descriptions.  CMN The repair info that you might carry and ultimately the value is so you   can use it to fix tings. the repair comes out of the tests not the   language. make sense to make sense to make enough use of language that can   say, "here is the test. here's what it says about how to fix." this outside   scope of language itself. I used RDF because the test becomes a URI. I'd   like to see us talk about what the language might look likt and what RDF   might do for us.  MRK I don't see a problem with the language containing more info. The UI   can sort it out. Put info about what needs to be tested, what has been   tested, Advice for how to repair, show in different place.  KD Possible to make scenario based on atomic test. Can we establish   relationship between test and scenario.  CMN We used RDF to describe and needed inference engine.  DDimitriadis Writing tests or results?  CMN Ennumerate tests. Then ennumerate rules for combining tests. If you   pass 1,2,3 you get stamp A.  PJ Very faimilar with XML, don't know RDF. How does it relate to XML.  MRK Scope of the tests? Explain part of the document needs a test and the   whole doc and then the site?  CMN Anything that has a URI - a single element, a whole site.  MRK Put them all together.  RN In my informal survey, there are 1 in 50 that state in contracts: use   HTML 4. don't want to bind themselves. Need to carry on explanation why   something fails. need good examples. easy to read. one centralized tool: do   HTML, do x. One access point. re: test conditions: implementation issue is   that there are over 40 browsers where you can't turn javascript on/off or   css. if make test condition, "now turn off css" or "invert colors." then   you don't rely on how a browser works. it will tell you how.  LK We've been hearing about meta requirements. In terms of pinning down how   and if use RDF. Which of these considerations are teh key things we should   focus on.  AB Why would you consider using RDF? XML?  RS This a.m's discussion is about what you want to describe and how to   point people to more info. In the course of describing these things, you'll   figure out which concepts to encode. RDF and variety of notations will do   in a variety of ways. must first figure out what want to express.  LK Ground rule: as we talk about general requirements, it should be   accompanied by a concrete example.  CS Like to see output importable by bug tracking systems. What line of   code, test, etc. If you end up with 1,000 reports.  LK Want something that could attach any sort of machine readable info?  CS Want to see output, may be a tool issue. Bobby does this, when you get a   report.  CMN Why RDF instead of XML? Wanted to refer to anything in the universe as   a test. RDF model, X has relationship Y to Z. X, Y, Z are URIs.  LK How does that grab you?  AB Right. Seems that people needed clarification.  RS When LK and I talked about this. One question that we thought we might   want to answer was to describe the e-mail traffic over the last few weeks.   Ultimately, what we do with this will be expressable in XML (i.e. no angle   brackets in my description) rather the mechanism. I drew this example to   tie to the N3 description. The notion is that we have stuff. Each oval is a   thing. One is "pat" two don' thavfe names. there is a relationship between   pat and the 1st unknown thing called "child." imagine that the objects   we're talking about are some bit of markup that exists on the web. the   thing on the left is an XHTML markup. it has an img element that fails one   of your tests. #img failsReqruiement http://www.w3.org/some-wcag#p1.   document and conformance claim that is being failed. what is the   conformance test? that's for you to define. prose is good for human   readers, not for machines. What else can we say? We add relationships   between the conformance tests and what repair tools can do. You get to   describe the relationships, their names, their semantics. We can name   anything. failsRequirement is a name of a concept. it will have a URI that   you can follow to find out what it means. We can find out info about any   thing in this relationship. To make it easier to express what's going on in   this image, we have RDF and N3 that we can express it in.  /* go to pat example with 2 children example in N3 primer LINK */  RS What are the attributes of tests that we want people and machines to   discover? What does this relationships mean? How we write them in e-mail,   we need to agree on notation but focus on concepts. Don't spend a lot of   time on syntax. Further info is who made the claim, what did they base it   on, what tool decided it was the relationship that exists, etc. Let's   define the concepts then go to the RDF spec.  CMN What makes this useful in the real world? The use case that PJ and NIST   have. Do testing, get results, etc. Another is Jutta's. If a small shop may   have 8 tools, if larger have 8 departments. What kinds of tools exist?  RN Lots of tools exist. Test conditions will come upon the tools and pages.   We need to prioritize what we do first.  JT seems to be an open issue about what EARL will actually be used for.  DD Here is a vocabulary of things to express.  testinfo - framework (wcag, svgspec, htmlsyntax), test id, test purpose,   code?, manual y/n  result info - individual result (url pass/fail, confidence level, syntax   error line)  repair ino - (optional)  run info - contraints platform, operator instructions (merge EARL Language   with harness language)  are there additional items we should store and process? /* get rationale   and requirements from DD */ perhaps syntax error line is based on something   more generic.  LR Under result info, I would like to see person info as well as date tests   are run. It is important to note that these reports can be used in   different purposes and ways. Dependin gon if i'm going to repair or as a   report to claim conformance, the type of info i get out of the report or   how i use the report will be different. think about how used to make sure   it's all covered.  LK After break let's flesh out addtional info that we want here.  /* break - most of the RDF folks leave */  /* DD changes "schema" displayed on screen on the fly to incorporate   comments */  RS notation and syntax are not user interface. The purpose of the syntax is   to exchange stuff between tools.  RN In two week sin new orleans is a conference by carnegie mellon. seems to   be synergy.SEI - Software engineering institute. Model for how you do   software engineering. Those are foundations for building software.  RS the way you specify the date of the result and the page what information   do we want to record.  LK The question is do we want to record an individual date and stamp for   each element? Some images change. for example, banner ads will change.  RS Test date applies to all.  WC Not necessarily. Test could be on an element or even attribute level.   Tool could only care about one or other.  RN code on the page, versus what's on the page.  CS Separate test from subject of test. Subjectmight be page or image,   runnin ghte sam etest.  WC Harness?  DD framework of interaction that leads you to a result. there are languages   to express how you move from page to page. The test info is part of the   harness.  LK The question on the floor: what does the test mean adn what is the scope   of these thigns?  CMN The scope of the test is whatever you are making the assertion about.   it should be a requirement at an atomic level at an individual object, or   page, or whatever atom you can think of.  KB We need to say that something applies to more than one URL. e.g., ,in   alt-text applies not only to image file but image tag. assertion of   alt-text is about 2 things.  LK good point. let's get to that point after this one.  CS It seems that that is not a test. The test is what you do. If you are   testing a site, you might test index.html (subject) test is "does it   conform" don't wan to mix those in a single term. suggest s wording change?   test case - do these steps, and test object.  CMN Think we're in agreement except on terminology.  JT 2 pieces of inof that relate to test: what the outcome is and how we're   testing it.  JR Instead of something fails, it's that "it fails on the basis of the test."  JT What is the test testing for?  RN Trying to describe test conditions.  CS language should express both automatic and manual tests.  CMN In one sense there is a test that you run. it says "open browser, turn   on the feature, make it happen." that is test case info. result info says,   "thi si sthe verson, browser, etc." Or test case "go to this store to this   shelf and buy the 3rd box...etc." whatever it is, you need the instructions.  CS I have seen this factored effectively: test case - what you have to do   again later, result - what happened.  CMN Are we testing rendered stuff or code? 1 - http.w3.org/image does the   alt-text work? human result. 2. validator says some element fails some   requirement of html spec. completely machine run. code level. don't think   we are writing the test language, we're discussing what we expect to be in   it. ratehr the result language.  KB Generalize platform to context.  RS Don't get rid of details like platform - will help you keep track of   details.  PJ Depends on the test you are doing.  RN I see 2 issues. we're all users. perhaps we're getting caughtu pon test   methodology. we're trying to show our wish list. can we brainstorm what we   want, then we could talk to a test engineer for the best approach. best way   can change - test case/test suite, etc. what do we want to accomplish?  RS Don't worry too much about packaging. I suspect that one objective is to   capture as much info as we can so we can precisely reproduce the test.   Focus on what data needs to be captured and for whom? don't fall into the   trap of generalizing from one detail. Capture as much detail as comes out   of the brainstorm.  JT We need to address what will the info be attached to. Describe the   results. Scenario: i head company x, we have a document that shows how to   conform to 508, must do these 10 things. i want to find a test tool that do   these things (perhaps more than one tool). then want to repair them. i then   find tools to help me repair these things. need description of evaluation   tool and repair tool and what they test or repair.  CS In a bug report i want to see: the environment (the context that the   tester believes are important - might be platform, browser, etc.),   reproduction steps, date test run, version of code aganst which run, steps   of the test, how make it happen, the expected behavior, observed behavior,   optional things - general comments, line number, messages created by   system, copy of code, screen shots. for interactive testing, but could be   applied to automated testing. e.g. reproduction steps: run page x against   schema y. expected results: i get this file with these results.  LK sequence of steps looks new.  CS If a test is not reproducable, is an error on the tester. expected   results still not captured.  LH Should be in test case info.  CS actual code is not there. image 3 could now be image 5.  CMN Only if you've changed teh page.  DD Could also have copy of subject of test.  CS Likely thta the test is run on monday and person who fix won't get to   until friday and will change by then. won't always be available, e.g.   coming from a cgi.  MC Line of code may not be approach. Could have 10 images on one line.  CS Enough geeky info so that developer can find it easily.  RN Specific test condition: if doing test for wcag, could pick up info in   browser, what about screen readers that dn't provide that info? would we   have a box for other devices?  CS Suggest discuss at tomorrow's meeting to discuss context.  LK Let's capture everything.  RN Other device.  CMN I want to talk about tools in general. I want to know what tools exist   already  KB We need to be able to include a cc/pp profile.  LK Can you make that a specific case of something more general?  KB All the things we're talkingabout as devices and platforms, one way to   do it is cc/pp but not only way.  RS Partly a question of how much you snapshot.  PJ concerned about things changing.  RS recommend a practise that when refer to test case, if we change test   case give changed version diff identifier. how much histrory do you want to   record. propose in each circumstance how to record change info.  RN Do we have the export to another tool?  DD requirement listed. just write a parser.  CS Does require some requirements.  DD Might account for steps in the form. may nt have the data.  CS For these sytems, be invalid and not be imported  CMN A value of including stuff by reference is you can ignore it by   reference as well.  MM if there isn't some way to extend this than how we're envisioning, it   won't be useful to all.  LK Doesn't this get into what RS was talking about? The benefit of   implementin gin RDF is that you can extend it.  RS Right. having a flexible structure, rather than a fixed DTD..most DTD   tools break. suspect want a structure where developers can include   structure of own w/out interfereing with other tools.  LK Is this captured here?  DD Part of the framework. It is a requirement.  CS agree has to be flexible. think the verbs should be user definable. may   only care about pass/fail, or perhaps something richer. might want to look   at modularization. perhap automated module and manual module.  DD Captured in subclasses - page/ataga/uaag/suite/bugtrack.  CMN good thing about rdf module can say how much you are saing then   qualify. different scope of statement - on eline, one word, etc.  DD's notes from discussion (from front of the room visual display)  rationales  ?       keep track of test/evaluation runs (store/transfer)  ?       processing in tools (pretty printed report, generate compatibility   chart, feed other tools, compare with previous runs)  requirements  ?       applicable to testing content/ua/service  ?       generic vocabulary/extensible subclass for   page/atag/uaag/suite/bugtrack...  ?       uri based  EARL schema  ?       testcase info:  ?       test suite id (svgspec, wcag, htmlsyntax...)  ?       assertion id (detail in framework: checkpoint, intermediate test   assertion)  ?       test purpose (prose)  ?       test url (for online test suite)  ?       auto/manual y/n  ?       operator instructions, reproduction steps, expected result  triplet:  ?       subject of the test (url, version/date, snapshot)  ?       result statement (date, what, who, context: ccpp, platform,   devices.. comments, repairinfo)  ?       testcase info (suite, url, purpose, op instruction/steps/expect,   manual)  e.g.  ?       http://example.org/page#img[3] danield says it fails with lynx on   linux, xmas 99.  ?       http://w3.org/tr/wcag#cp1.1, using bobby, manual check  ?       http://foo.com/svgplayer1.23, passes  ?       http://w3.org/tr/svg/ts/assertion1, part of   http://w3.org/svg/testsuite1.0  ?       http://example.org/page on 2001/3/1, syntax error, line12, missing alt  ?       http://validator.w3.org, auto mode    Next steps  JT This afternoon: AU/ERT comment on WCAG 2.0 then go through AERT open   issues WCAG  ?

JW Right, that's what we agreed up on in WCAG a few weeks ago.  CMN The issues seem mostly techniquey, but valuable to go through them.   Spend 2 minutes on each of them or 2 minutes and agree to postpone. Useful   from AU perspective for how WCAG will approach them.  JT Valuable piece of going through today, might relate to revision of WCAG.  WC move that we either limit our time, we have 3 groups here and more   interesting issues to discuss.  JT limited discussion at beginning? 1 limited at end? 5    EARL and WCAG  LK Are tehre people here who have not heard about EARL? Briefly, it is a   machine-readable representation of evaluating a web page. Could contain   suggestions for repair. Applications: raw form that would go into a report   tool. Several different EARLs, conditions, could be merged into one report.   (human readable). also fed into an authoring tool for convienient mechanism   to give tool list of what to repair. in terms of WCAG, there are 2 possible   ways it could impact WCAG. if we assume only used with WCAG, then each   statement could point into techniques (in terms of 2.0) and then give   "passes/fails" or other rating. Another appraoch is for EARL to produce   lower level statements that don' thave checkpoints in them. e.g. "alt text   is missing." Rule sets that take that as input and in the context of WCAG   that violates 1.0 or 1.4. or 508 ruleset. with 1st apprach, wcag would have   machine-readabvle reference. possible to point into wcag. instead of plain   text, in terms of HTML it would say "this is missing an attribute." on the   other hand if EARL reflects more fundamental facts from which you derive   checkpoints, then need rule base to convert to WCAG statements. then, who   writes the rule base and is it infomrative or normative?  CMN Interpretting that into checkpoints. working out how to do a test of   your spec.  RN Timeline for implementation of EARL?  LK Nothing has been committed to?  RN We have people interested in EARL. Talking to Karl Dubost, he said there   was a QA conformance meeting in late march.  CMN I will be there to represent EARL.  LK We are interested in those people joining the effort.  RN One tool on the interest group does a WCAG conformance guideline test.   Will there be correlation?  LK This is a format for out put of tools, not a tool.  CS One bullet point of th eEARL proposal is to compare results to one or   more standards. e.g. internal intranet sites. sounds like something like   specML. If feed a spec in, it has to be machine-readable. what would that   look like? It would be a wonderful thing to have.  CMN COmpare results, isn't new. use an rdf thing. does not provide testing   language. a separate project.  CS How do comparison?  CMN When do the tests, ability to record test and say what test was.  CS How does the comparison work?  CMN If you have 15 things, img have useful alternative? etc. then say 508   conformace you need these 3 tests, for wcag you have 2,3,7,9 out of a   million. designed to allowo ther tests to be allowed.  CS MAchine readable version of WCAG is out of scope or not? that's what i'm   trying to determine.  JT It's not a testing tool, it's a method for tools to talk to each other.  LK As far as our charter is concerned we have a general clause, "helping   development".. My personal opinion is that without formalizing it, using an   existing method with rdf. don't want to invent something new.  JW er will have to resolve how they want to support multiple specifications   in their system. if they think it's useful that the test output should   bemapped to a requirements of multiple specs, then they must figure out how   to implement the system. then a joint work item between wcag and ert. what   are the issues that involve both groups that need to be decided, e.g. issue   of conformance claims. Daniel put together a schema for which to make   conformance assertions. If the new language is appropriate for that role,   and provides appropriate granularity, then WCAG may adopt as base for   conformance claims.  LK At this point, judging by the discussion, people are still formulating.   I don't think we could come to a conclusion this afternoon, it is more of a   heads up. The simplest issue is to at least point into text readable   portions of it.  JW Any XHTML version including techniques would povide anchors. 2.0   techniques written as checkpoints in 1.0 version. possible to refer to any   of them from an external source.  HB The EARL has importance for potential readers for them to say, you   conform at a level that my AT can handle. Should there be a standard link   fromt he doc to the place where teh review may be, is something you may   want to consider. versioning issues: if successful with EARL, go back to   creators of docs. particular review can age. we should be able to notify   the reviewer any time the doc has been updated.  MC EARL as a language speaks to saying this thing conforms with that and   that is a URI. machine readable goes into defining what "that" is. for some   guidelines be easy, for others not easy. abstraction of guidelines from   techniques helps. can put it in the context of a specfici language. some   can not be tied down to one thing. e.g. navigation bars. how define that in   such a way that i will always find it and never not find it. what that   means for wcag is that it's an issue when thinking about the gidelines.   while not tying the guidelines donw to being too specific, need a way to   define what apply to.  MM Making a machine-readable spec, lends self to automated tool. techniques   will be non-deterministic. e.g., wherever we use the word minimize. we can   not look at a doc and determine if we have minized the use of images.  CMN versioning isrequirement for EARL, out of scope for this discussion.   already listed as reuirement. notifying reviewers is not yet in EARL. EARL   let's you point to a test. agnostic about test if it is human or manual.   mapping of how you test if you've met a requirement of wcag, is something   we have to do. we're oblighed to show hwo you conform to the spec. whether   we do that by writing up each technique with a test case or if we do it   afterwards and how is something we have t do. if we make those available,   people reuse known tests. not a wcag issue.  JW Can we brin gthis discussion to a few specific points.  ?       WCAG should decide that it will consider EARL as a possible basis   for conformance claims  ?       WCAG should affirm that designing 2.0 techniques, it will ensure   that each technique and approach to testing are identified with specificity   so that EARL can refer to.  we need to confine ourselves to how we will carry this forward.  /* vote */  JW Only members of WCAG allowed to vote on this.  WCAG Will consider EARL as basis for conformance. Places this on the open   issues lsit. favor 11, against none. Resolved.  WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each requirement can be   referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test results to be   associated with it.  CS clarification - we won't use words likeminimize or make them atomic enough?  CMN test has a URI  KHS We'd have to work hard to not do it.  /* vote on JW's point 2 */  Resolved: WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each   requirement can be referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test   results to be associated with it.  LK question of machine readable rules. don't think we can decide it now.  MM w/out resolving normative vs. informative, end up with orphan   checkpoints. EARL and related testing tools won't be able to test for.  CMN Resolving normative vs informative is work of group in explaining what   it means to conform to.  LK I think there is a misconception. Inability to automate does not put it   outside scope of EARL. It can record results of human judgement. e.g. clear   and simplelanguage.  MM: QA dept. won't be able to determine "minimize". There will be orphan   requirements that beg the answer "well...ok...sure". Not a fully formed   compliance with subjective tests.  WC: There will always be subjective tests. As long as manual steps are   clear, no problem. Claims will always be subjective. If assertion is   machine readable, easier to communicate your case.  CS: "Minimize" is defined at the beginning by designers not athe end by   testers.Assertion made following design.  JW: Proposes to move to the next agenda item.  CMN: Still valuable to thrash this out.  PJ: Wants to talk about necessary and sufficient conditions for techniques.  CW: We whould continue discussion.  /* vote - defeated, discussion will continue */  KB: Agrees with JW.  CMN: EARL doesn't care about wording of tests. It does allow different   results for same test. Primary use is not legal, its so stuff will work. It   builds up a body of previous test judgements.  Josh: EARL expresses too much. WCAG techniques need to be more clear about   what repairs are.  MM: There are design principles that use "avoid" or "minimize".  LK: Subjective cps or techs are totally irrelevant to EARL.  MC: Lots of challenges for EARL to handle conformance for WCAG.  Katie: If terms need to be defined consistently, its something for the   glossary. Implementation model for setting up an accessible site.  WC: Passed to EO.  WC: Would like higher conformance granularity.  CMN: Implications for AU and ER not EARL. Let's move on.  JW: Yes, let's move on and leave aside WCAG issues.  JT 4 issues here: conformance statements, operationalizing requirements,   evaluation, EARL language. Not just about WCAG relates to all.  RN Plant a seed: spec needs to read more like a requirement. requirement   rather than words.  KHS important in 508 stuff to appreciate good faith efforts.    EARL and aU  JT Issues are teh same.  CMN Yes, discussion would be teh same except substitute ATAG for WCAG.  LK As far as applying EARL to specify if an au passes ATAG, but one purpose   of EARL is an info feed into authoring tool. Do you need to take that into   account when write spec? bolted on later?  CMN implementing EARL is a useful technique for bunch of AU stuff. not an   issue but an action on AU WG.  HB Also action on EO. usability and accessibility are foreign to most all   of the books that address web authoring.  LK If i create a EARL report, there is a issue that AU wouild import an   EARL report. specific scenario: dreamweaver. should it be seriously   considered? if so, back of mind with other ATAG requirements.  JT How is EARL used to express ATAG conformance and how it is used to   repair doc.  RN If stored where could be referenced locally, great. Agree with Harvey,   right. We need to state proper terminology.  CMN EARL is considered. Does not give rise to other requirements or issues.   implementation issue.  JR Not sure how EARL is stored, a file or info w/in a doc?  LK That's implementation detail. Info is there, linked with the doc. Like   CSS - in head or linked.  CMN ditto.in ATAG techs, havce to figure it out.  JR One reason this comes up, originally it was so wouldn't have to do   manual checks over and over again.  CS if becomes requirement that extra XML included in doc, likelyu not used.  JR could be stripped out b4 published.  CMN maintain stuff or toss, depends on tool or the stuff.  MRK are mechanisms like annotations. have RDF servers.  LK propose: there be an issue added to AU issue list: add requirement that   tools import EARL. note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear   that EARL has firmed up.  Resolved: add to AU issue list: add requirement that tools import EARL.   note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear that EARL has firmed up.  HB Server should deliver EARL evals to requesting client so that they can   deliver appropriately to what the user's capabilities are.  CMN UA check EARL statemetn about a page.  Action CMN take issue about UA checking EARL statements about a page to ERT   and UA.  Issue: implications on EARL as to how to express for UA.  /* break */  /* donovan minuting */    /* wendy's personal notes */  priorities - inherit - govnt policies are saying Level A of WCAG, and not   necessarily of WCAG 1.0. Requirements - general to HTML - people need to   test for each language. end up with 1.1.1-1.1.15 for HMTL, 1.1.16-1.1.26   for SMIL, 1.1.27-1.1.37 for SVG, etc.  broken up by technologies, but we also have our core techniques which are   cross-technology.  top level also for policy makers and managers.  "fractal worlds" navigation paths through different types of users ("how to   use this document"). Techniques will still exist.

AERT open issues will be incorporated by WCAG   2.0 techniques. agreed upon structure - framework.    /* WC returns to minuting */  Resolved: WCAG will adopt those aspects of AERT into HTML techniques that   are relevant.    Other cross group issues  JT in courseware packages there is content that allows interactive   authoring via the content. also, when is the best timing for ATAG 2.0 to   draw in WCAG 2.0.  WC CR.  JB Get input in lower tiers so don't have to go back to the beginning of   the game.  CMN The goal is that we would shadow up through the process. Best guess of   going to last call and then CR.  WC then shadow our working drafts.  CMN Give us warning for last call.  JW I've seen W3C specs taht say "editors and working group believe next   draft would be  last call." this good idea.    Next F2F meetings  JW For all three?  CMN Do we want to do F2F meetings in conjunction again?  JB Encouraging suggestion: in terms of W3C planning process. Interested to   hear if have morejoint meetings. what are your plans over teh next year. in   generating ideas, we need to rotate the meetings geographically. We end to   get to europe and asia.  CMN bunch of AU people aren't here. this has been really useful.   particularly where we have a joint meeting, then have individual groups to   have meeting but can run next door to get clarification.  WC At October, WCAG proposed going to PR in November of this year and doing   that in Australia.  JB Poll yesterday "wantto do this again?" "6 months?" 38 yeses. "12   months?" 38 yeses. so another opportunity between 6 months and 1 year.  CS How many people going to Hong Kong?  /* 7 */  /* unanimous - do this type of meeting again at a plenary like this. */  RN I like the technology meeting yesterday to find out what is going on.  JB how soon to do next one?  6 montsh - 3  12 months - majority  9 months - 2/3  location - australia, europe, japan, greece, haiti(?)  What aboout a WAI half week (3 or 4 days)  Lots of joint, plenary single group stuff.  JB many organizations say they can not get approval for meetings inHawaii   since a junket. does 4 days considered a week?  CS flying where have 18 hour flight, 8 hours of meeting, 18 hour flight is   impractical.  JW Europe easier?  CS For me europe and australia are somewhat similar. (in terms of travel).  Helle More serious talk about going to europe. we have very few people from   europe here. particularly, where we have smaller companies who are not part   of the w3c work but interested in accessibility or required to consider   them. will help outreach. must do more in europe.  KB Agree with europe idea. We were bought by a european company. Brussels   would be good.  JB The WAI has an explicit obligation this year and next to hold a certain   number of meetings. We've complied with, since the metings in brisotl   however the intent is for outreach and recruitment. there are fascinating   things in europe, due to the commitment on the european union level. an   initiative w/in each country. everyone is doing it differently. a WAI most   of week in europe would be great. Greece is one of the worst.  WC What countries recommend?  JB Can't answer.  WC Finland?  RN Couple this with an outdoor activity. Like an adventure through a museum   or some way to enjoyment of the area.

We started to capture this info with the (sorely out of date and   sparse) User Agent Accessibility Page [1] but it's a lot of   work.  Hopefully we'll be able to glean info from the UA group or else a   service like the HTML Compendium or WebReview will keep this info up to   date so we can refer to it.  Unless....    Do we have volunteers who want to help document this stuff??  I'll help   anyway I can if someone has the drive to shepherd this.  It really needs to   be done.

      Jenae and I have been working on a test matrix - the list of platforms,   user agents, and assistive technologies we want to collect test data for   (she'll be sending a draft of the test matrix in the next day or two).  We   also came up with a list of test cases for the WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints with   "until user agents" clauses and mapped those to existing HTML Techniques   for WCAG 2.0 as well as test cases in the UAAG 1.0 test suite and the HTML   test suite.  Attached is a table of WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints with until user   agents clauses and the matching HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0, UAAG 1.0 test   cases, and HTML test cases.  This is a draft and we offer it for discussion.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         text/html attachment: testcases.html          

        Ben and I have been cleaning up the issues list.  This email includes  issues that had been reopened. In most cases, we reopened an issue rather   than close it to maintain the history associated with the issue.    Issue 172 - checkpoint about use of standard character set  <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=172>  Wendy talked with Richard Ishida, Martin Duerst, and others at the   Technical Plenary about a definition of text and how to reference unicode   in our document.  Wendy has an action to write up these discussions and a   proposal to close this issue.    Issue 317 - Clarifying color criteria in Guideline 1.3  <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=317>  After adding color to guideline 1.3 it seemed the issue could be closed,   however Gregg raised issues about the meaning of the existing text.    Issue 330 - When to expand abbreviations and acronyms  <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=330>  The March 11, 2004 working draft now uses the language "programmatically  located" but issues and questions remain regarding this language  and many  of the previous comments are still relevant.

The only reference to ATAG10  >is in the "Related resources" section.  >  >[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/#scope    Typo in our comments. It should refer to ATAG rather than AERT.  AERT is   being incorporated into ATAG-TECHS and thus not a document on its own   anymore.  Ref to ATAG is appropriate, ref to AERT is not, other than as   historical.    > > If these  > > do not use standard devices correctly, what else am I to use?  >  >We discussed this as part of issue 323 [3] at our recent  >face-to-face meeting.

We have shied away from this issue, but it keeps coming up so I expect   we'll have to do something with it some day:  standardizing class names to   provide semantic meaning to an element or group.  For example, labeling a   table as layout or something like that.  The null alt-text is basically a   way to say "ignore this image since it is purely decorative."  Some people   want to add similar "semantics" to other objects.    Using the MAP element is a way to group navigation links, fortunately, this   idea was incorporated into the X/HTML spec.    > > 33.

It was my understanding of this section that if a standard accessibility   API does not exist for an operating system, that the developer must create   and use their own.  This would cause an AT developer to learn a different   API for each browser on a platform that did not have an accessibility API.    <blockquote>  Developers are encouraged to adopt operating system conventions and   features that benefit accessibility to meet the requirements of this   document. However, if these features are not accessible, developers must   provide an alternative accessible solution.  </blockquote>    For example, say the NewWebOS (fictional) does not have any operating   system conventions and features that benefit accessibility.  Browsers Y and   X run on NewWebOS and want to conform to UAAG 1.0.  These browsers use the   system's paint methods.  These methods draw text pixel by pixel.  What is   the alternative accessible solution that the browsers provide?  They will   have to write their own API for an AT to use to get text.  If X and Y do   something different, AT developer Z will have to learn both of their methods.    This happens today and thus why JAWS works better with IE than with   Netscape - JAWS has more access to what IE knows and does.  I thought one   of the goals of encouraging the use of system APIs is that the AT   developers will only need to learn the standard API and not all of the home   grown variations.    In the case where an OS does not have standard APIs with accessibility   features we need to encourage developers to push the OS for a solution   rather than create their own.  Perhaps until the OS provides a solution   they can provide a kludge,but in that case they should also work carefully   with AT developers.    Thus, I propose (and this needs work):  <blockquote>  Developers are encouraged to adopt operating system or language conventions   and features that benefit accessibility to meet the requirements of this   document. However, if these features are not accessible, developers must   work with assistive technologies on that platform (or language) to provide   an alternative accessible solution and should work with the operating   system manufacturer or other third parties to create accessibility   conventions and features for that OS (or standard API -  in the case of Java).  </blockquote>    I don't know how browser manufacturers will feel about this, but I do think   we should rely on the OS or language as much as possible to provide   standard features that ATs can hook into.  That's what Active Accessibility   and the Java Accessibility APIs were all about.    If you can find another way to clarify this or if you don't think it needs   clarification, I'm fine with that.  But this was my interpretation   (or  misinterpretation, as the case might be).

      Geoff,    If people agree that this is an o.k. thing to do, then we would include it   in the techniques document.  The current phrase that I pointed out would   probably be reworded to something like:  <blockquote>  Equivalents for sounds can be provided on the same page as the sound or in   a separate file.  If in a separate file, provide a short text equivalent   (like an "alt-text") in the text of the link to the text transcript or   description of the sound file. The link to the transcript should appear in   a highly visible location such as at the top of the page. However, if a   script is automatically loading a sound, it should also be able to   automatically load a visual indication that the sound is currently being   played and provide a description or transcript of the sound.    </blockquote>    thoughts?  --wendy    At 01:53 PM 2/23/00 , geoff freed wrote:  >i don't see anything wrong with providing short descriptions on the same   >page.  it might actually avoid user confusion and extra work for the   >author.  in fact, it might even be a good idea to include this option in   >the techniques document.  >  >geoff/ncam  >  >  >  >On Wednesday, February 23, 2000, Wendy A Chisholm <wendy@w3.org> wrote:  > >We were wondering about text not included in the body of an OBJECT element  > >but just on the page.  > >--w  > >  > >At 01:16 PM 2/23/00 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  > >>Why not give an actual example:  > >>  > >><object data="some_film" type="video/x-my-private-format">  > >><h2><a href="some_film" title="link to download the example movie">Example  > >>2.7 is a movie:</a></h2>  > >><p>In scene one, Charles and John are talking on the balcony.</p>  > >><object data="scene_one_pic" type="image/x-my-other-forat">  > >></object>  > >><p>John says <q>well chuckles, how goes it?</q></p>  > >><p>Charles shakes his head slowly.</p>  > >></object>  > >>  > >>Which makes it clear that the transcript can be included directly, if  > >>desired.  > >>  > >>(Please edit the example to taste.

GV and BC will be busy until next Tuesday preparing for a major   Trace-related event, so the earliest we'll get the updated internal draft   will be later next week. in the meantime, Wendy will update the issues list   and make some edits to the source and Jason will chase up the wording for   some of the checkpoints in Guideline 5.        Action Items    Action GV: (with help from ben) create a document that is a master list of   ideas related to 4.1. These will have 3 levels: fairly solid, possible   (need work), future.  Action WAC update issues list, move notes to issues list, link to issues list.  Action JW check with CS on wording for guideline 5 text.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Very interesting paper.    Interactive Conformance Testing for VRML                                   Mary Brady  Lynne Rosenthal  Information Technology Laboratory  National Institute of Standards and Technology  Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA  ABSTRACT  Conformance testing for the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)   provides a means for determining if an implementation satisfies the   requirements and specifications of the standard. The National Institute of   Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a VRML test suite (VTS) to   systematically address some of the problems posed by the nature of testing   three-dimensional graphics. In addition, we will address using the WWW as a   vehicle for delivering the VTS system. This paper discusses the test   development strategy and design issues in developing the VTS.    http://xsun.sdct.itl.nist.gov/~mkass/x3d/html/design.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    We would like to publish the Requirements for WCAG 2.0 Working Draft on the W3C Technical Reports page. [1]  We are aiming to publish to TR on 25 January.  Please send comments to the list before 18 January.    We have not published the Requirements to the TR page yet.  The document had changed very little from the time it was first published (June 2000).  The primary change is the addition of an appendix that contains the consensus items from the "elephant" discussions.  This Appendix to the Requirements for WCAG 2.0 was first published for Working Group review on 18 October 2001. [2]    The consensus items resulted from discussion that began at the September F2F meetings in Redmond, Washington, USA. [3]    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001OctDec/0128.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0960.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      There was a question in Thursday's telecon about real-time captioning and   streaming formats.  I sent a note to Geoff Freed and he responded that   realmedia and windows media support real-time captions.    --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      The proposal is available at: http://www.w3.org/2000/10/12-ATAG-AERT.html    This fulfills my action item to write up the discussion from the AU WG f2f   last Saturday.    I propose that we discuss this at the join AU and ER meeting on   Tuesday.  The questions that need to be answered:  1. Do people agree this is a good direction to move in?  2. If yes, who needs to do what to make it happen?  3. What communication mechanisms need to be in place for the ERT WG to feed   info into the document if it is being maintained by AU WG?  What will AU be   relying on ERT to do?    Other questions?  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Hello,    I will probably not be able to attend the 8, 15, and 22 May teleconferences   because I will be traveling, in face-to-face meetings, and attending a   conference over the next couple of weeks. We need minute takers for each of   these days.  I will be available via email if you have any questions or   concerns.    Information about the meeting template is available at:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002AprJun/0311.html    Thank you,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      Hi all,    There is a new working draft of the ERT available:  the latest is always available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/    I've been using the list to keep track of the changes to the   document.  Thus, for each change I send an e-mail to the list.  Note that I   have not incorporated all of the responses to my proposals.  I have some   catching up to do!    Also note that this has not been spell-checked yet.  I valiantly tried, but   gave  up because of the tool I was using. I'll be converting the document   to scripts next week and the spell checker that the scripts uses is much   better.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Could people report on their action items from last week's meeting (minutes   located at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000214.html).  These are   the ones that I am not sure about:    WC find what WCAG says - need extra file or not? pretty sure a recent   discussion, if so post to ER. if not, send to WCAG.    MC propose wording for change to ERT to check for audio on SCRIPT, EMBED,   APPLET, and OBJECT elements.    LK go through document, pick out sections where a probe would apply.   Propose a blurb to put in each one.    Open from the previous week:    LK take quesiton to WCAG wg - "alt or text content of applet. if text in   applet, also need 'alt'"    MC dig up something about identifying tracks in quicktime.    WC dig up info on tracks in SMIL.    WC look into Flash to determine if can identify various tracks.    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      hello,    Jason and I discussed success criteria for an afternoon while I was in Australia last month.  The purpose was to begin thinking about which success criteria were technology-specific and which were "core" - in terms of the Core Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [1] where there are examples and tests that are not technology-specific.    We also thought about how the Gateway to Techniques for WCAG 2.0 might look.  Refer to the Gateway for WCAG 1.0 [2].  This draft is a bit of a combination of them both, but without all the content.    This draft [3] is really rough, and really no more than a collection of our notes.  It's not formatted, has no date, status, etc.  It's more just to publish our initial thoughts and perhaps stimulate some discussion or work on the various areas.  Also, it's another chance for me to mess with XSLT. <grin/>    Please send comments to the list.  If you would like to volunteer to begin collating this information please let me know.  Since this document is generated using XSLT, if someone wanted to fill in information, it would be a matter of editing the XSLT. [4].  There is quite a lot of information in the various drafts that we have that could be pointed to.  This was a quick first pass.    Thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-CORE-TECHS-20000920/  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-TECHS-20000920/  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/12/techs-gateway.html  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/gateway-techs.xsl      --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Are you proposing a guideline or a checkpoint?  Where in WCAG 2.0 does it   fit?  What are the success criteria?  What are examples?  What are definitions?

      Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 2 July 2001 at the regularly   scheduled ERT WG time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out   what time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910    Since it is the first of the month, members of the AU WG will join us   (although it might be sparse since Monday is a holiday in Canada).    Agenda for Monday.  This is obviously more than we can cover in 1 1/2 hours. I would at least   like to get through the first item.  Please let me know which other topics   you would prefer to discuss.  Feel free to start threads on the list over   the weekend.  I'll be sending along some proposals in the near future.    1. EARL abstract  for DIWG as requested by William last week [2]  2. Sean's XSLT for EARL to XHTML [3]  3. Next F2F meeting  4. AERT open issues [4]  5. Comparison chart of various tools, use of EARL [5]  6.

      Participants: Katie, Chris, Sean, Wendy, Harvey, William    Meeting summary:    - We went through some of the issues on the AERT issues list to determine   which were closed, which were for WCAG and which were for AU.  WC will   update the AERT issues list and send a note to both groups to let them know   that we have these issues to add to their issues lists.  However, since WC   maintains the WCAG issues list, she'll update it to incorporate the AERT   issues.    - We briefly talked about Annotea and EARL and the possible tools that   might generate EARL.    - We talked about what WART will produce, a checklist, linearized EARL,   EARL.  WC will continue to work on WART.    - WL and SP agreed to continue working on a primer.    - SP feels the EARL schema is stable. There is some concern that recent   discussion in RDF-core might change aspects of RDF, but that those changes   wouldn't affect EARL much or at all.    - We're considering having our next F2F the first week of October in   Brighton and we would like to try to colocate with PF.  CMN will take idea   to PF.  SP will send list of possible meeting places to CMN.      ---Detailed minutes      #9  CMN AU issue, AU point to EARL. say it's closed.  WL EARL is the solution, we're addressing the solution not the issue.    #30  WC a WCAG issue  CMN Argue for AU. in WCAG the test is simple, if you don't have an   accessible page, you can use an alternative. If not, it's part of the   assessment of accessibility.  WL Can say that to both.  CMN In WCAG, prefer not to do that, say "make an accessible page."  WC Part of this is manual, but WCAG needs to make checks clear.  CMN Run it against WCAG.  CR There are some ways to do checking, "is this object described in the   text page."  CMN It's a possible negative test.  WC For ATAG Techniques.  HB Do we assume that each version has a date that we can compare.    WC Big lump or smaller messages?  CMN smaller - to deal with.  WL Separate subject lines.  WC Easiest to say to WCAG, "issues 1-30 in our issues list is yours, add to   your list."    #30 - WCAG, w/CC to AU  CR Always disliked text-only page solution.  CMN A good technique.  CR Then never come back to ATAG.  CMN Real-world examples where can't.    #45  WC, CR, CMN - WCAG  WL detecting accessibility issues...  WC Waiting for checkpoint solutions for scripts.    #12 ATAG    #14 ATAG    #15 ATAG    #16 WCAG    #17 ATAG    #18 WCAG      Annotea and EARL    CMN EARL is a language to describe problems in content.  The problem that   EARL doesn't address is how do you find those when you are doing an   evaluation.  Where do you put those results.  Annotea provides one   possibility, to associate results with content.    SP Wouldn't have one inside the other. Since you have URI of page inside EARL.    CMN Annotea associates 2 pages, it might get it from extracting from   EARL.  The annotation scheme needs the info.  Annotation at: URI, it might   be in annotation or referenced in annotation. An implementation detail of   associating the two in a look-up exercise.  It gives us an implementaiton   of attaching the things and querying them. If we use that mechanism we will   repeat the URI twice.    SP Take it out of EARL.    CMN Do that if we tie ourselves to Annotea. Don't think we should. Use it   as A method.    WC could store locally.    CMN Or inside the page you are working on.    WC Talked w/SSB lately?    CMN No, have talked with Hiawatha Island (Frontpage plug-in - ACCRepair)   and Usablenet (plug-in for Dreamweaver). They are both interested.    WC What determines if they will implement them.  SP and WL, where do you   think we are?    WL Saw thing for linear-EARL, is there an authoring tool for EARL?    SP There is the bookmarklet.    WL There is also linear version, could form basis of people wanting to   write EARL who don't know.    SP When handling RDF, know model.  If you handle a subset, should be easy   to output.    WL WART should generate EARL w/out people realizing it is generating EARL.   And the linearized version could be how EARL gets generated from plain   text.  Anything like UWIMP?    SP I see what you're getting at, WART should be structured enough ....    WC What about a checklist?    SP If WART could generate EARL, then transform into XHTMl version, "here's   what we trasnformed it from" if you care.    WL THen generating data points. e.g., what problems scripts make, then say   "what portion are the result of script stuff."  My original point is, the   DI WG could use a more technical explanation of what EARL could od.    SP Started writing new primer.  Quickly got technical.  I drew a circle   labeled animal circle inside "human" to show subclass example. when i   loaded on IE, it only had labels. Want some way to linearize it, an   alternative version. Transform gracefully.    WC State of schema? Open issues?    SP We should be fine despite some of the RDF-core discussions to change   things.    WL Anyone from WAI following?    SP Nothing too controversial. It's stable.  Need some more general   documentation.      Next F2F: First week of October in Brighton?  Try to meet with PF?  CMN will take idea to PF.  SP will send list of possible meeting places to CMN.        --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

      On the 14 February telecon we discussed how to decide when an image needs a   longdesc.  previously we said when an image was "complex."  in the call I   read some excerpts from the National Braille Association's Tape Recording   Manual.  We decided to incorporate those ideas to replace the phrase   "complex image."    This is my proposal:  <blockquote>  IMG element should have a valid LONGDESC attribute and a descriptive link   if describing the image will add information not given in the text of the   page. The amount of information in the image will determine how detailed   the description should be.  </blockquote>    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        Hello,    One comment about the 12 June draft was to group properties and   classes.  I've added the following section called "Properties of Classes" [1].    Is this what you were looking for?  It's still really rough, but I think it   makes it more clear as to which properties you can use with which classes.    I treated Assertion differently from the other classes since it's the basic   building block.  I could do something similar with Evaluation (the more   basic building block).    Thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2002/06/21-earl1.html#constraints    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

        Hello,    The WCAG WG should ensure that WCAG 2.0 is consistent with and contributes   to the goals of other WAI deliverables, including the "Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [1], the "Authoring Tool Accessibility   Guidelines 1.0" [2],  the "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [3],   the "XML Accessibility Guidelines" [4], and the WAI Glossary [5]. (this is   proposed text for our new charter)    One of the primary intersections between the documents is   conformance.  Tomorrow, we will look at some of the issues related to   conformance and UAAG.  We will start the session with Ian Jacobs summarizing:    - How did UAAG 1.0 solve the problem of conformance flexibility?    - How did UAAG 1.0 solve the problem of subjective requirements?    This will lead into group discussion of the following questions:    - What can we learn from UAAG 1.0 and the UAWG's experience?    - How can WCAG 2.0 reference UAAG 1.0?    - What user agent features does WCAG 2.0 assume are implemented?    Required reading:     1. Gregg's conformance proposal [6],     2. UAAG 1.0 Conformance [7],     3. Lee's checkpoint 5.4 proposal [8],     4. Ian's response to Lee's proposal [9],     5. Ian's comments on WCAG 2.0 [10]    Conformance is one of the stickiest issues we have to deal with.  As we   will hear from Ian, the UAWG wrestled with conformance issues for quite a   while.  Where the WCAG WG wrestles with the "Write clearly and simply..."   checkpoint, the UAWG wrestled with "DOM access to HTML/XML content"   [11].  They used many strategies to reach consensus one of which is   conformance profiles.    Recent issues related to WCAG 2.0 conformance:     1. If we have "Level 1+" and "Level 2+" can         someone claim Level 2-?     2.  How does a developer declare the scope of          their claim?     3. What if someone tries to exclude a necessary         part of their site?  e.g., All of the site except <uri>         is included the claim and <uri> is the final step         required to purchase something from the site?     4. Can someone exclude 3rd party content in the         scope of their conformance claim?     5. How do you claim conformance for an aggregation         services that pulls together accessible pieces to         create something that increases accessibility for         a particular type of user?     6.  Claiming conformance is making an assertion that          you satisfy a certain level of success criteria.  A          conformance claim at the Minimum Level is an assertion          that claims many things, including that (with the current          4.1 proposal) they have reviewed all content  "with          these things in mind." What if their site has          1,000,000 pages, will they be able to conform at the           minimum level?    Expectations of tomorrow's call. Participants should expect to:    - leave with a better understanding of the UAAG 1.0 conformance profiles.    - learn about some of the hurdles that the UAWG had in moving UAAG 1.0   through the W3C Recommendation process.     - discuss the current WCAG 2.0 conformance proposal in relation to the   UAWG experience and brainstorm about possible ways to apply that experience.    Participants should *not* expect to:     - solve the conformance issues related to WCAG 2.0 in 90 minutes.

        Jukka,    Thank you for your thoughtful comments. I have attempted to address a few   of them.

I have removed the link from the News section and left only the news item   about our next telecon.    Both internal and public drafts are available to the public, but they serve   different purposes.  The  public draft exists to solicit feedback from   people who are not in the working group (i.e. "the public") as well as keep   the public up-to-date with our current thinking.   Per W3C process, a   public draft should be published every 3 months.  This is called a   "heartbeat" requirement - every 3 months we make a bit of noise to draw   people's attention to our most recent work.    The internal drafts should be published more often  and allow the working   group to try out new ideas and to see changes in context.    People are able to comment on either, but we actively solicit feedback on   the public drafts since they are more polished and stable.    >In my experience from trying to explain and promote WAI guidelines, I would  >say that it would be a considerable improvement to formulate the basic ideas  >in a few key principles, as opposite to fourteen guidelines in WCAG 1.0.

If you look at the W3C process [1],  WCAG 2.0 has to go through Last Call,   Candidate Recommendation and Proposed Recommendation before becoming a   Recommendation (assuming that we progress through all stages of the   process).  We expect that the technology-specifics will be available *well   before* we go through Last Call, so before we even enter the second major   stage of the process (the 1st stage is a public Working Draft. We have had   3 of these already and expect to have at least one, possibly 2 more before   Last Call).  [1] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/tr.html#Reports    The technology-specifics for WCAG 1.0 are not normative, nor will the   technology-specifics for WCAG 2.0 be normative.  I'm concerned about your   statement that the European parliament considers the techniques normative.    >The structure of the guidelines in the draft is confusing.

Similarly, the "success  >criteria" are partly redundant, partly just guidelines at an even more  >concrete level (so that they could be presented as Specific Guideline 1.1.1,  >etc.).

And definitions should  >normally be given at (or before) the first occurrence of a term or  >abbreviation, and could often be merged into running text.    This is an interesting suggestion that we will have to consider.  I think   you have identified an interesting issue, but we will have to consider the   best approach to address it. Thank you for your proposal.    >The guidelines should be kept as separate from the question whether  >compliance to them can be verified objectively, and in particular whether it  >can be verified programmatically. Otherwise there will be strong bias  >towards objective verifiability, neglecting extremely important factors that  >cannot be objectively verified (such as using the simplest language  >suitable, or adding illustrations when needed, or giving informative error  >messages).    Another good observation.    >The proposed "success criteria" contain "level 2" criteria saying that a  >checkpoint has been met if "the site has a statement asserting that the  >content has been reviewed and...", followed by something that typically  >refers to the beliefs of the reviewers. I find this totally pointless.  >Requiring a review is somewhat debatable; it does not relate to  >accessibility itself. Requiring that a specific statement is made on a Web  >site about a review could be worse than meaningless. (It would not be  >unrealistic if a user, upon seeing such a statement, will think that sending  >any feedback will have even less chances of leading to anything, since the  >authors explicitly say that they have, for example, reviewed everything and  >"added as much structure as they felt was appropriate or possible".)    People who try to implement WCAG 1.0 are often unable to determine if they   have met the requirements.  Thus, we have set a goal for ourselves to write   testable statements.  However, as you say, some important aspects of   accessibilty that are not easily testable are not required in and of   themselves, but a statement about them is required.  I agree that it is not   clear that this increases the accessibility of content.  This has been a   primary issue that the working group has struggled with and this is our   best approach to balance all of the factors.  Do you have a specific   suggestion for how we can provide clear guidance to authors?

        Geoff,    >What do developers use a TRANSITIONAL DTD for?  Mostly it is used when  >tables are required for layouts.  With the recent discussion on not  >requiring <TH> in tables that are only used for layouts, I feel this is  >something that if the WAIGL feels is important, it has to go to the Markup  >GL to get changed.  In this case I would suggest things along the lines of  >  >* TRANSITIONAL DTD = <TH> is optional, summary is optional  >* STRICT DTD = <TH> is required, summary is required    We are not suggesting that TH is required on _all_ tables.  We are   suggesting that if you use a table for layout that you do not use TH in   that table.  We are suggesting that TH is required only for tables that   present data (i.e., cells can not stand alone, there is a relationship   between cells) and not for tables used for layout (i.e., each cell should   be able to stand on its own).    The HTML WG has said that tables are for data only and that there are   better mechanisms for layout.  However, today, developers are still   developing for user agents that do not support CSS positioning well and   many authoring tools are still generating tables as the primary means for   layout.  We are caught between the future-thinking ideal and the current   reality.    >And new items like the element attribute contextHelp have to be added to the  >next version of the Markup before they become a formal recommendation or  >considered by WAIGL, cause this type of thing is driving developers crazy.    Before we include a technique describing a new element/attribute (such as   contextHelp) we will make sure it is included in an industry-accepted   specification or is a widely-used technique.  For example, "embed" does not   appear in the HTML specs but since "object" isn't supported consistently   (or at all in some user agents) we suggest how to use it in an accessible way.    >Take the recent discussion on <ACRONYM> and <ABBR> here, when the XHTML 2.0  >proposes to drop <ACRONYM>.  Why support something in WCAG 2.0 that will be  >deprecated?  Why even bother with something that the Markup GL sees fit to  >deprecate.  I know it hasn't happened yet, but it looks like it.    XHTML 2.0 isn't a W3C Recommendation, yet.  WCAG WG should address the   needs of developers who want to make content accessible *today.*   In the   Techniques Task Force we have discussed labeling techniques as "legacy" or   "deprecated" or "future" to help clarify these distinctions for developers.    >I think Mark Pilgrim's frustration  >(http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/13/semantic_obsolescence) as  >representative of a lot of developers who are trying to do the right thing,  >but are caught in the fragmentation that happens, even though this whole  >process is about trying to readdress just that point.

Why haven't user agent developers   implemented the standards that they helped develop?  Why don't users update   their browsers each time a new one is released?  Why don't authoring tools   generate valid code?  There are several answers to each of these questions.    >What is going to happen is that we are not going to end up with a formal set  >of grammars, but just a better and improved HTML soup.  >  >Currently, I think the only developer who can get this type of thing right  >is one who has full access to configuring their web server, deploying  >transparent content negotiation, and transforming their documents using  >XSLT.

We'll stay aware of developments in XHTML 2.0.  We will clearly   label if a technique is for HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.  Where we have ideas   about accessibility improvements in XHTML we will discuss them with the   Protocols and Formats Working Group (PFWG [1]) who is our primary contact   with other W3C working groups (per our charters) and is actively monitoring   development of XHTML 2.0.  An historical example: during work on WCAG 1.0,   we worked with PFWG on accessibility features for HTML that were adopted by   the HTML WG and included in the HTML 4.01 spec.    Thanks for voicing your concerns and helping to make sure we contribute to   the W3C mission. I hope this calms your frustrations/fears. If not, let's   figure out what we need to do.

      For those of you with W3C member access, the final schedule is available   at: http://www.w3.org/Member/allgroupoverview.html    For those of you not at yesterday's call:  We are not yet sure if everyone will have to sign a confidentiality   agreement to participate in the meetings and then request member access to   view the schedule.    Regardless, the significant bits for this group are:  We are meeting Thursday and Friday (1-2 March)  at the Royal Sonesta Hotel  5 Cambridge Parkway  Cambridge, MA 02142 USA  Telephone: +1 617.806.4200, Reservations: +1 617.806.4255  Meeting Code: MIT-W3C  Discount Rate: $130 (plus tax) available until Friday, 26 January 2001,   5:00 pm EST  Hotel Reservation Details  A block of rooms have been reserved at the Royal Sonesta Hotel at a   discount rate of $130 (plus tax) per night, single/double occupancy. The   discount rate will be offered from Sunday, 25 February through Thursday, 2   March 2001. High speed Internet connections are available in guest rooms   for a flat rate of $10.00 per night. (Laptop computers must be 10baseT   equipped.).  The W3C will host a reception Wednesday evening, 28 February from   18:00-20:00 at the hotel. Beverages and light hors d'ourvre' will be   served. We encourage folks to take this opportunity to meet working group   members from other W3C working groups.    Transportation Details  Logan International Airport is the closest international airport to the   meeting site. The Royal Sonesta Hotel is located three miles from Logan.   The travel time between the airport and the hotel (meeting site) will vary   between 30 minutes to one hour depending on traffic conditions. Taxi fares   will range between $18.00-$28.00.    Please Note: All events will take place at the hotel. There is a large   shopping mall across the street so you will not need a car during the week.   There is a major road construction project going on in Boston called the   "Big Dig." For this reason, we recommend taking a taxi or public   transportation rather than renting a car. If you prefer to rent a car, all   major car rental companies have locations at Logan Airport (Avis, Budget,   Hertz, etc.).    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

      Summary of action items and resolutions  - Action everyone: review the CIF   http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/iusr/documents/cifv1.1b.htm  we'll discuss more next week.  - Action WC: check w/AG about assumptions and connections between CIF and EARL.  - Action SBP: send summary of CR and SBP discussions to the list.  - Action WC: incorporate short descriptions of implementations and look at   incorporating prose from Schema into the primer.  Incorporate the summary   SBP sends to the list.  - Action WC: create RDF file of WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.  - Resolved 15 October - next joint meeting with AU.  - Action everyone: nominate items for the F2F agenda next week. Joint   meeting with PF.    Present  - Chris  - Wendy  - Katie  - Sean  - Sharon  - Charles    *** CIF    SL free version (earlier, basically the same) is at:   http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/iusr/documents/cifv1.1b.htm  I'm not sure of the connection between these two that EARL.    WC Marking up the data. CIF looks like a schema to me.    SL Based on best practices. Could view as fields.    WC Assume Al's connection is that if EARL could be expanded to be the   markup language for CIF.    SL Don't have large numbers of reports and info that need to be   automated.  What kind of machine processing do on a report?  Perhaps,   compare info from two users.    WC Perhaps if consumed by procurement people, could compare tools.  CMN -   value of EARL for evaluating AU tools?    CMN Value is to query results.    SBP EARL is basically a database format, it is non-proprietary.  If putting   reports into a database format, EARL is something to consider.    SL No incentive to put into database format since not enough of   them.  Usability test is not looking at conformance.    SBP Data analysis can only be done by a human.    SL Right, it is context driven.    CMN What you are storing is prose descriptions.    SL Tables of time on task, or results of questionnaires.    CMN Can  use EARL for anything you can regularize.  If you have a numeric   scale, options, that's a useful place to have EARL.  The other side of   stacking up data, makes it easy to do a piece of evaluation, have someone   else finish it up next week.    SL Not how a user test works.  Could translate fields into EARL or another   language to store as database.  If there were usability tests, how would   one use them?  What automated things would you do with them?  Some newer   approaches - where collect data from 100's of users - you might want to do   something with EARL in that respect.    WC Other telecon that KH is organizing?    SL GSA looking for knowledge management tools.  Using CIF to get usability   info out in the open.  Possibly looking at using EARL to store comparisons   of tools. But, not sure if enough data to use EARL.    Action everyone: review the CIF   http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/iusr/documents/cifv1.1b.htm  we'll discuss more next week.  Action WC: check w/AG about assumptions and connections between CIF and EARL.      *** Test files and expanded WART    WC At WCAG F2F decided going through test files and "voting" on what   accessible or not would be useful exercise to determine if everyone agrees   on interpretations of WCAG.  Expanding WART to go through test   files.  On-line form.    CR Had associated with WCAG 1.0, now what about 2.0?    CMN Most are useful tests for both versions.    WC Status of test files?    CR Going through second pass.  Will there be an AERT 2?    WC No, there will be an HTML Techniques document with "rules."  Those rules   taken from AERT.  AERT primarily HTML with a little CSS and scripting.  We   will be expanding CSS techniques, and generating SMIL, SVG, etc. with   AERT-like rules.  Please keep in touch with Matt May.        *** tagged PDF repair process    WC When generating files in PDF, will also generate tags that are stored   w/in the format that are basically HTML.  However, don't always get the   best tags.  e.g.,  table header shows up as TD instead of TH. Use outline   view to change.  A last resort, not a way to generate content, but to   edit.  Particularly since when regenerate the file, your edits are lost.   Not a way to send that info back to the generating application.  We don't   deal a lot with PDF, but it is an interesting repair process that I don't   think we've encountered or thought much about.    KHS Heather sent more info to AU list about Word creating PDF files.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2001JulSep/0113.html        *** EARL Primer to EO    WC Thoughts? Stuff to change?    Action SBP: send summary of CR and SBP discussions to the list.  Action WC: incorporate short descriptions of implementations and look at   incorporating prose from Schema into the primer.  Incorporate the summary   SBP sends to the list.      *** EARL to XHTML    CR Could we have a summary at end: 50 passed, 20 failed.  instead of lists   of pass and fails.    SBP No statistical functions in CWM.    CR Can it format into a table? or graph?    SBP Table, yes.  graph - SVG?    CMN If in xml send to graphviz...although probably not the time of graph we   want.  Passing 15 out of 27 is not particularly useful info.  These are the   ones you passed, these are the ones you failed is an artificial measure.    CR Useful to know if passes/fails are P1s or P2.    SBP Good point. Have to put that in the EARL itself.  List of test files   and if P1 or P2...then could merge that.    CMN Say that X, Y, Z meets checkpoint 3.1.    CR The RDF refers to a test file, test file refers to AERT, AERT refers to   WCAG.  Therefore, could get that info that way. Is it possible to go   through all the info using XSLT.    CMN If AERT is regularly formatted, can strip it out.  Could do, but   quicker to do by hand.    CR Should the info go in the test file or RDF output.    SBP We'll have an RDF file on the W3C web site so that we can merge that   info in.    CR Someone needs to create that file.    Action WC: create RDF file of WCAG 1.0 checkpoints.      *** New structure of home page    WC changed structure. Will be keeping up to date.  Let me know what you   want to see on here, what is useful or not, etc.    CMN Racing cars.  We need racing cars on the home page.      *** Joint meetings with AU.    WC Used to have them the 1st of the month. Haven't had for a while.  Next   week is the 1st but we'll be at the f2f.  What would we talk about in a mtg   with them?    CMN Test suite. 1st of november is out as well due to AC mtg.    Resolved 15 October - next joint meeting with AU.    Action everyone: nominate items for the F2F agenda next week. Joint meeting   with PF.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

        Here's a tangent...but please hear me out.  There are likely holes in the   proposal, but perhaps we can find a nugget of something useful.    I've recently been working on the comments received about Checkpoint 1.3   (Make all content and structure available independently of presentation).   This checkpoint combines a variety of WCAG 1.0 checkpoints that lean   heavily towards HTML.  e.g.:  3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than   images to convey information. [Priority 2]  3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]  3.5 Use header elements to convey document structure and use them according   to specification. [Priority 2]  3.6 Mark up lists and list items properly. [Priority 2]  3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects   such as indentation. [Priority 2]  5.1 For data tables, identify row and column headers.

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/03/12-minutes.html    12 March 2001 ERT WG minutes    Participants  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Chris Ridpath  ?       Sean Palmer  ?       Daniel Dardailler    EARL  /* LK reads WL's e-mail Semantic EARL from 12 March */  WL What is meant rather than what it looks like. If someone clarifies their   use of class in a style sheet, the kinds of things we argue about in GL   deal with providing semantics. We need to give the user enough info so they   can format information as they wish. We're looking for adding the   generalizations. Moving towards a semantic web requires that what we seek   are inherent in it. Saying what you mean rather than what you want done   with it are key aspects of both accessibility and semantic web. They both   deal with repurposing. I'm looking for an index of repurposeability.  LK Thoughts on what EARL predicates are relative to this? What statements?   What would you be pointing to and what would you be saying about it?  SP Might be a good idea to look for presentation elements as well. Look for   semantics in style sheets.  DD WAI guidelines are already organized in testable assertions   (checkpoints). We're ahead of other W3C specs that use plain English   (must/should/may). Do build a test suite you have to extract the testable   assertions. We have that.  SP There should be no shoulds in recommendations, since can't test. Why   should it be there?  WL If you use "should" then you should have the why or excuses for not with it.  DD That's a different point. I agree with that. I don't see what it has to   do with testing?  SP There's nothing to test against.  DD It's in the spec.  SP A "should" means some places where not appropriate to use. Need to   clearly document.  WL An authoring tool thing?  DD In other words, don't need rationale for "must" since have to do, but   for "should" need since optional. In the EARL output, there should be a   field for comment?  LK Therefore, looking for a specific type of comment field. Specify why did   not implement something.  SP Right.  DD Looking for specifics like we geneated at the meeting.  WC Look at the mail archives?  SP Mid-February came up with several examples and vocabulary. Schemaat the   bottom of the summary. Modularized.  DD This is difficult to understand. What is the subject? object?  SP It's basically a core vocabulary. This is what is needed. People can   define own objects and statements. e.g. for ATAG. It's a bit out of date.  DD Why need person?  SP Person is an object. X is testing by Daniel. Daniel is a person. This   needs to be human readable as well as machine readable, otherwise will get   fragmentation.  LK Can we look at tstatements from the F2F, Daniel and see how they fit   into this?  DD Result file be a triplet. I'm looking a the minutes from the f2f. There   was subject of test, result, then more info on test case. I'd like a flat   approach rather than object orienteded.  LK I asked Raph and Libby if we say "daniel asserts checkpoint 5 is passed"   the usual way to do that in RDF or N3 is to make that a statement about a   statement. The simpler way to do it (as in Annotea) you have a statement   like "checkpoint x is not passed" then person asserting is another property   hanign off that statement. What they would recommend is that statements   about statements doens't buy you anything. Tehrefore, that tilts toward   flatter model.  SP using anonymous nodes.  LK A property of a node rather than itself being a statement.  SP In 5.2 of the infomesh document we have ATAG level A, where the property   is ATAG level A. It is an anonymous node expressing that something conforms   to level A.  DD Are we going to try to evolve the notation to map the vocabulary or work   on the vocabulary in free-style English then map onto notation?  WC From what I understood from Ralph, we need to figure out what we want to   express before notation. Not sure we documented all that we think we want   to express.  LK I need concrete triples. Otherwise, not sure we're saying the same thing.  WC Do it iteravly, give an example with notation. If can't say want you   want using the notation then the language is missing something.  WL Wants an example of an example, LK?  LK Alt-text. This node is type "accessiblity statemtn" the statement has a   bunch of properties, e.g. "does it exist?" and "quality" etc. :x person, :x   checkpoint - those specific terms hanging off of the statement. That's the   conceptual diagram. When write it in N3, keep saying ":x property value"   then we don't have to keep repeating things. Then, get rid of :x by saying   "a EARL statement" SP, you're defining an object system on top of N3?  SP So people can make their own anonymous nodes.  LK We have a class system on top of N3, N3 is a short hand for RDF. As much   as I like the notation, I worry that it is reinventing the wheel from   knowledge engineering. e.g. 15 years ago there were engines to do this   stuff. Are these the best tools?  DD If you look at the rDF model, it explains the foundation of the work.   It's not new, it's just a simpler subset. That's why we're using it.  WL Somebody who understood SGML made a subset that transformed the planet.   This in part due to the simplification of the notation. I can wrap my head   around it.  SP RDF is decentralized, since it uses URIs. It's the way the Web is. It's   web-izing knowledge. There are myths that need exploding.  LK I'm not arguing to do this in XML. I want to use knowledge   representation, there are just zillions of them.  WL Most of them fell on the altar of owning the roots of the ontology tree   problem (my opinion). Never be universal if proprietary.  LK Do we want to try expressing the general predicates from the F2F in EARL.  WL Need 5.2, 5.3, etc. to see what needs to change to 5.1.  DD I antitipcated seeing a detailed vocabulary in plain english. to write   down the properties and names. then agree on that (as a WG). then we can   develop the notation. then decide n3 or rdf, classes? etc. First is to   agree on the vocabulary.  LK Would we come up with a vocabularly expressed in triples independent of   how we notate the triples?  WL Mostly a list of predicates?  DD Predicates and properties.  Action DD: write more English examples.  /* dd and wendy leave, LK scribes */  LRK: sean example statements?  SP: metadata folks was asking about metadata... lets find them... this one   uses reification "this image has no alt text" this image does not conform   to this particular wcag checkpoint Comment would be human suggested output.   Also quality of alt text. Vocabulary has what we need.  LRK. checkpoint 1.1 is missing alt text  SP: {uri earl:conformsTo uri-of-wcag-checkpoint}a log:falsehood or {uri   earl:doesNotConformTo uri-of-wcag-checkpoint}  LK: how do tools now handle "a log:falsehood"?  SP: CWM knows what how process it. Also could handle other way if we   generate log:falsehood form doesNotConformTo.  WL: this is lost to most of world.  LK: This statement has just uri's. So how does tool know what to do?  SP: tool would know what the checkpoints mean and know to popup dialog box.   And could have mapping of wcag 2 to wcag 1 checkpoint so both popup same   results.  WL if you have a transform. E.g. when wendy makes mapping from wcag1 to 2  LK: always one to one to one mapping?  SP: lots of other equivalents. would be good if in one schema it was in   another schema.    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      one resolution that i forgot to capture in the list I just sent:    Resolved: Once "nagging issues" are closed we will start at the top of the   document and work our way through.  We will set up an open issues list and   people can volunteer to shepherd an issue through to consensus.  This way   we can have more than one person pushing the document and perhaps get some   more work done quickly.    --w  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        Hello,    In the fall of 2003, the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the   American Institutes for Research (AIR) conducted a series of usability   tests of the WAI Web site: http://www.w3c.org/wai/.  The AIR report is   available [1].  Specific for this discussion, I highly recommend that you   read "Key Findings." [2]    On Wednesday's Techniques Task Force teleconference, several of us took an   action item to create a prototype to demonstrate linking from guidelines   and success criteria to the techniques gateway and then from the gateway to   the technology-specifics (David, Michael, Ben, Tom, Chris, and me).  In   this discussion it also became clear to us that we need to separate the   "traffic cop" functionality of the techniques gateway from the general,   non-technology-specific techniques (similar to the WCAG 1.0 approach where   we had Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [3] as "traffic cop" and Core Techniques for   WCAG 1.0 [4] for non-technology-specific techniques).    Yesterday, Shawn and I discussed a mock-up of various options of linking   from Guidelines/success criteria to techniques.  Option 5 [5] is a result   of this discussion and attempts to address the following factors that were   noticed during the AIR usability testing:    1. When looking for "how to" information, people were looking for links   that said, "how to" or "example."  The links marked "Technique for   Checkpoint..." did not trigger an association with the material they were   looking for.    2. Most people are not familiar with the numbering scheme. i.e., most   people do not refer to "Checkpoint 1.1" they think in terms of "provide   text equivalents."  A link that says, "Techniques for Checkpoint 1.1" does   not trigger an association with "how to" information for this checkpoint -   it doesn't have any "scent." [6,7]    3.  In WCAG 1.0, there are 65 links of the form, "Techniques for Checkpoint   X.Y."  These links could be ignored because they don't obviously provide   new or related information.    (Shawn - feel free to add additional thoughts or clarify any of these)    Thus, it seems less an issue of formatting the links and more an issue of   writing good link text.    Thoughts?  --wendy    [1] <http://www.air.org/concord/wai/index.html>  [2] <http://www.air.org/concord/wai/findings.html#keyfindings>  [3] <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-TECHS-20000920/>  [4] <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-CORE-TECHS-20000920/>  [5] <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2004/04/links-from-wcag.html#Option5>  [6] <http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=3110/nam1012433977/>  [7]   <http://www.acm.org/turing/sigs/sigchi/chi95/Electronic/documnts/papers/ppp_bdy.htm>    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

        As mentioned in this last meeting, I've been playing with an issue tracking   tool.  During the meeting I added a few issues to the database to test the   process.

      At last week's joint teleconference between the AU WG and the ER WG, it was   suggested that the ER WG's scope should include evaluation of tools.  The   scope of the ER WG has been evaluation of Web content, although we do keep   track of tools that perform evaluations, repair, and transformations.  At   this time, we would not like to expand this scope.    We anticipate continuing the work on test suites (sample pages) to help   tool developers determine if they have correctly identified accessibility   issues on a page (i.e. implemented AERT).  However, this is different than   the request that we heard from AU WG which was to develop a tool (similar   to the Web Accessibility Report Tool) that would help developers determine   their conformance to ATAG.    The minutes from our call where we discussed this are available at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      HI all,    the minutes from today's call are posted at   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000103.html    However, the notes that I had taken for the last part of the call were   lost.  I tried recreating them the best that I could.  Let me know if i   left out anything major or if I misremembered something.    For those of you that missed the call here is the summary of action items   and resolutions:  Action: WC & LK discuss offline what should be required  by "linearization".  Action: WC take TABLE summary, caption, and title issue to WCG.  Action: CR will check into checking for the STYLE element in the HEAD   elements for Guideline 6.  Resolved: We will go to a weekly meeting.  Action: LK will reserve bridge for 1 1/2 hours every week.  Resolved: We will aim for first public draft by mid-February.  Action: EVERYONE - review the document and post issues to the list.  Action: WC track issues in open issues list.  Action: WC and CR edit document as issues are resolved.    Note that we are aiming for a public draft of the working document by   mid-February.  This means that we all need to review the current document   in detail and post issues to the list.    it was a good call today!    thanks everyone,  --wendy        

      Hi all,    What do people know about fuzzy logic?    It seems that we might want to investigate the topic for the   guidelines.  It is my understanding (this is from a conversation with Bert   Bos yesterday) that you take decisions from several sources and factor them   together.  The basic idea is that truth is not black or white but that   there are shades of grey.  You poll a number of sources for their opinion   and determine a shade of grey (0 through 1) that gets rounded to final   answer that is either 0 or 1.    For example:  Checkpoint 14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a   site's content.    There are many methods to determine the reading level or legibility of a   body of text (i don't know that any have been automated).  We could take   the results of several, and combine them in some way to determine the   "clarity" of content.    thoughts?  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/04/23-minutes.html    23 April 2001 ERT WG minutes    Summary of action items, resolutions, and proposals  ?       Action DD: once EARL page up and agreed upon by group announce to   the QA list, both internal and public (www-qa), RDF-IG, ATAG, WCAG,   validator list (although Gerald will be aware through other lists), PF.   We'll try to get more feedback.  ?       Action SP: upload earl stuff to w3c site.  ?       Action WC: change ACLs once get word from SP.  ?       Proposal: ERT wait to meet with PF, something in June in Amsterdam   doesn't work for ERT.  ?       Resolved: no meeting 30 April, next meeting 7 May.    EARL  DD need stable W3C uri for this info. Need it in RDF.  WC Want me to copy what he has from infomesh to W3C?  DD Existing infomesh page that presents EARL as of a month ago. Has good   background info. Needs to be cleaned up. Use that as a basis for EARL.   Merge that with what Sean put up at infomesh.net/2001/earl/0.9  DD Once we have that, which groups do we publicize this to?  Action DD: once EARL page up and agreed upon by group announce to the QA   list, both internal and public (www-qa), RDF-IG, ATAG, WCAG, validator list   (although Gerald will be aware through other lists), PF. We'll try to get   more feedback.  /* sean joins */  DD page not saved as HTML, get e-mail?  SP Looked into that. Something w/your browser?  DD Doesn't matter, WC will take that plus old page and merge them into   something...  SP I've already done that. I've folded in 0.9 page into old page. Haven't   been able to upload it yet.  DD We'll put the RDF version at the URI you proposed.  SP Still waiting for SW IG to give word on stability of N3.  DD Yes, some discussion about that. Some people not in favor, some said useful.  SP Yes, division. Danbri doesn't like it.  DD Once we've done that I will announce it to various lists so people can   play with it. then see where it goes from there. do you need more time to   polish stuff? we gave you write access to some portion.  SP Yes, I have access to 2001/03/earl.  Action SP: upload earl stuff to w3c site.  SP Need someone to change ACLs.  Action WC: change ACLs once get word from SP.  SP Talking with Aaron about it last night. We've been working on it all   weekend. We've been using Daniel's model, but it is difficult to express in   RDF. There are so many ways to do it. Don't know if it is optimal. Not too   certain that the model can be converted to XML RDF since there are   complications with context brackets. Not sure how they get represetned in   RDF. There are bugs, that might be one in the schema. However, should be   stable enough to implement. Tools implement in N3 or RDF?  DD I don't care. I find N3 easier to read, but not that much. RDF/XML   syntax, we could then use XSLT and make it into something more readable   (using verbs and sugar). N3 forces you into either a transformation into   RDF and then into HTML. It's another step for human consumption. There was   discussion about "is there a 1 to 1 mapping between XML/RDF." From unicode,   it is not the case. Perhaps N3 can be fixed.  SP It's been changing a bit lately. Some unicode support, but limited to   python support. It can never be completely compatible with XML/RDF. As long   as the model is expressed. Have people looked at the diagrams?  DD Yep, look good.  SP Used WebDraw.  DD is that the aaron simplified model?  SP Yes. Hard for me to grasp what he's been doing. Have a node hanging off   of test subject. He's using as a property. There are comments in the   examples. It hides the semantics we're trying to express. Those should only   be things that will not be machine processed. I should write more   documentation on that.  DD We made a timeline, first an example, then work on some by hand. We need   to work according to this plan. We need to look for more comprehensive   example by hand. Then have a tool generate. CMN started looking at   something. Perhaps WAVE or Bobby can do something quickly. As well as HTML   or CSS validator.  SP I cc'ed the schema to validator people. They seem quite interested.    F2F  WC LK won't be able to attend.  CR I can attend.  WC Unlikely that SP will attend.  DD We need to have a clear target for the meeting. CMN and I will be there.   We could ask DanBri to come. HB? I doubt WL will be there. Do you think   WCAG or ATAG meeting would join? One reason to meet in Amsterdam is XForms   and HTML. We should join them at some point. We could identify a day to   meet with them. 1/2 day for each. Already consumed a day of joint meeting,   mostly for WCAG.  WC Anticipated agenda?  DD Requirements for XHTML 2. More along line of PF in a sense.  WC Joint PF/ER meeting was good in December, good discussion on EARL.  DD What is the benefit for WCAG or ATAG to meet in Amsterdam on those days?   Other than meeting own.  WC Have them review our new techniques documents.  DD As far as ERT is concerned, we might as well wait for PF/ERT opportunity.  WC Maybe best to hold off until we know we have a prototype.  CR Any news on when WCAG 2 will be done?  WC Nope. Shooting for something stable by end of the year.  DD What about WCAG?  WC Haven't heard from Gregg yet. Need a meeting, especially since we can   get Dundee folks there to talk about usability testing. Perhaps informal,   but to talk about usability testing.  DD What is a good overlap with xforms? middle of the week? 20/21 then   people who want to go to xform come a day early, those who want to stay for   xhtml can stay a day later.20/21 for WCAG, ATAG can go on either side of that.  Proposal: ERT wait to meet with PF, something in June in Amsterdam doesn't   work for ERT.    Next meeting  DD No meeting next week since meetings in Hong Kong.  Resolved: next meeting 7 May.    $Date: 2001/04/23 15:06:07 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Rather, my question is, "what is the accessibility rationale for this   technique."  I did not see any, thus did not include any in my proposal.    I think the rationale is "good design."  Regardless of whether I choose a   high-contrast background and foreground color combination (white and dark   red), if the user only selects a foreground color (white) current user   agents will not select a high contrast background color.  They will display   the author set background color (white) and the user set foreground color   (white).  The user will have to select a foreground color as well.  In some   browsers, the user could select "high-contrast mode" where the browser   selects both the foreground and background colors.  For example, yellow   text on a black background.    >Maybe we should ask the ER or UA groups to look in more detail at the issue  >of ensuring contrast? Most User Agents allow a choice of colours, although  >most do not automatically pick a contrasting colour where there is a conflict  >or semi-specified colour scheme.    I think this is a UA issue and have CC'ed the UA working group.  Chris   Ridpath recently published results of a color study, so I have CC'ed ER as   well.  Refer to the techniques for Checkpoint 2.2 in the 26 April 2000   working draft of AERT [1].    Since there do not appear to be any objections to my proposed edit of the   CSS techniques module, I will make the appropriate changes.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast      >On Thu, 8 Jun 2000, Wendy A Chisholm wrote:  >  >   I have two questions in relation to this issue:  >   1. will user agents automatically make adjustments for background or  >   foreground color if the author specifies a good combination but the user  >   only specifies one or the other (foreground or background but not  >   both)?

        Today's discussion was based on the recent reorganization proposal (reorg   #4) from Ben and Gregg [1].    Summary of action items:  1. action: john, katie, and (others who are interested) work on list of   terms to use for wcag 2.0.    ===  Summary of discussion    Many people were concerned about the number of axes that apply to each   statement in the document:  - normative vs informative  - core vs extended  - required success criterion vs best practice vs additional note    (During the call, Yvette made a diagram of axes.  description and link at [2]).    Because of the complexity, it is difficult to determine what is required vs   what is optional.  A variety of simplifications were proposed (and some   variations also discussed). The common theme among these is to find some   way to keep best practices distinct from success criteria.  1. combine best practices and additional notes  2. move best practices and additional notes to a separate document, or an   appendix  3. flatten the layers into a single axis but create 3 levels (similar to   p1, p2, and p3 in wcag 1.0 but with different terms.  in other words,   replace the current matrix of distinctions with a linear one)  4. reconstruct the document so that current checkpoints become guidelines   (or in some way remove checkpoints to decrease confusion with   technology-specific checklists).  5. rename "best practice" "additional criteria"  6. move best practices to extended checkpoints  7. move additional notes to techniques gateway  8. call best practices "additional measures that go beyond conformance"  9. restructure so that most important stuff stands out most    Concerns about these proposals included:  1. If best practices and additional notes are combined, do we dilute the   group?  They had been one group (best practices) but were split because   some of the best practices were testable and seemed more important than   some of the additional notes.  Do we want to go back to that organization?  2. If we put best practices in a separate document it will not be read.  We   need to keep all of the information in the document that will help people,   even if it is not testable.  3. If best practices are included and not testable, do they have a place in   the document?  4. We attempted to move best practices to extended checkpoints (reorg   proposal #2) but found it difficult to uniquely name each new extended   checkpoint.  5. If something is not required, it should not be part of the standard.  6. We should use "must, should, not" language as used in other standards   (and defined in RFC 2119 [3]).    General concerns that surfaced during the discussion:  1. Which is our primary goal: to write a document that addresses all of the   needs of people with disabilities or to write a document that is   testable?  Does our Requirements document accurately and unambiguously   reflect our scope and goals?  2. "Required Success Criteria" in Extended checkpoints is confusing.  When   asked if we should remove the word "Required" the group felt there was a   deeper issue that needed to be addressed and that removing the word would   not solve the issue.  3. If we want different legislative bodies to create similar policies   (i.e., adopt what we recommend), even though we are not making policy if we   don't produce something that is effective legislative bodies will produce   differing policies.  4. If the document is named "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" but does   not address all disabilities it should be renamed.  5.  Only the 4 guidelines are general enough to stand the test of time and   apply to all technologies; particular concern about voice and mobile   applications.    Broader ideas that people seemed to like:  1. Write "the book" that includes everything for those audiences who are   motivated to do more and only include the minimum requirements in the standard.  our primary audiences are:  - people who want to make policy,  - people who care about accessibility and do so without a legal mandate,   i.e. highly motivated and interested in "doing more")  - people who don't care and will only do the minimum  The minimum set of criteria should be what we assume cynic implementors   will do. For those who want to do more, have "the book" that describes this   in prose. The UAWG has "common UA imp problems" we could have a similar   document that could accompany "how people w/disabilities do the web."  It   could be "wcag for policymakers" either in an introduction or a separate   document.  Or "the book" would describe "what is accessibility? what do you   need to make the web accessible?"  (In his personae document, Tom's matrix lists two types of people in our   audience those who are willing and those who are not willing. [4])    2. Simplify the language that we use.  Set up focus groups to determine which terminology will work best.  Start   with the plain language lexicon (1500 words) and see how many more we need   to add to express the ideas.

      Hi all,    I took an action item at last week's call to find out how whitespace is   being handled in XML, to ensure that the strategy/interpretation of   whitespace in alt is consistent with future mechanisms.  I also created an   HTML test page and discovered some interesting results.      XML investigation    the XML spec [1] says the following re: the preservation of white space:  <BLOCKQUOTE>  An XML processor must always pass all characters in a document that are not   markup through to the application. A validating XML processor must also   inform the application which of these characters constitute white space   appearing in element content.    A special attribute named xml:space may be attached to an element to signal   an intention that in that element, white space should be preserved by   applications.  </BLOCKQUOTE>      HTML test page    I have created a test page [2].  the results from MSIE5 and Opera 3.6   (win98) are included in the page.

      Hello,    At last week's meeting, William said he would like us to write an EARL   abstract to send to the DIWG.  I have been going through the DIWG archives   to determine what they would be using EARL for (the immediate   need).  However, I am still not clear how you envision them using EARL,   William?    It seems that it has been suggested to use EARL instead of CC/PP or to   enhance CC/PP for device independent authoring with EARL. EARL is intended   to describe how content meets (or fails) conformance criteria.  Are you   thinking that it would be used in conjunction with CC/PP to describe   conformance preferences?  e.g., in CC/PP state that I only want content   that meets WCAG Level A?  Help?    Here's the trail of interesting bits that I found:    DIWG short thread where Shlomit expresses concern that EARL/RDF not general   enough for them, that they should use XML.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001May/0007.html    Appears to me that they are wanting to use XML to create a single source,   not to annotate existing content in any way. Therefore, is EARL really a   solution?  i.e. they are talking about a combo of XForms and XHTML-Basic.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Mar/0051.html    William states:  <blockquote>  Codification of what the "system requirements" for Web content are can   probably be handled by "provider assertions" through something like EARL.  </blockquote>  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Jun/0072.html    Sean chimes in with "CC/PP => EARL"  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Jun/0075.html    Back in March, there was a discussion about XMLGL.  Some feel that the work   of DIWG is to define how to write for a UA while XMLGL/WCAG is to define   how to write for the user.  At this point, Roger Gimson says that CC/PP was   built to look at both the user and the device.  He lists all of the   capabilities that the DIWG should consider.  Seems to be that yes, this   should be built on CC/PP.  My understanding of the purpose of EARL is to   record a gauge to accessibility not helping to make something more   accessible.  However, since EARL will be attached to a piece of Web content   to annotate which accessibility criteria it meets, I suppose that in   describing how it meets it, it could associate accessible alternatives with   primary content...but I don't think it is appropriate for authors to rely   on EARL to do such things. That sounds like a kludge for a language that   does not express semantics well...but I guess that's the whole point of RDF...  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Mar/0105.html    Shlomit and Stephane Maes argue against the overlap between Device   independence and accessibility.  Stephane says the idea of graceful   transformation is a key concept, but he does "not believe that to have the   document understood by different devices is equivalent to having the   document appropriately presented or optimized for interaction through the   channel."  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Mar/0106.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Apr/0004.html    Sean responds about the aims of XMLGL.   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-di-wg/2001Apr/0013.html      A while back, I wrote this to describe what EARL does. Perhaps this could   be the basis for an abstract:  EARL allows someone to describe how well Web content or a tool follows   guidelines or specifications. For example, using EARL you can describe if a   particular image is used in an accessible way on a Web page. Or if a user   agent displays SVG images properly. "Properly" is defined by the SVG   specification. "Accessible" is defined in WCAG.    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

      Hello,    Please register if you plan to attend the 15/16 July 2002 WCAG WG F2F in   Linz, Austria.  http://cgi.w3.org/Register/selectUser.pl?_w3c_meetingName=wcagjuly2002    Meeting info available at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-agenda.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Here is the detailed list of editorial changes.  The doc is available from:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-requirements    We are moving forward with publication to TR and expect something in the   next few days.  This is to inform the WG of the changes that were   made.  Discussion and suggestions from here on out will be incorporated   into the next draft.    1. Added an abstract. It says:  This document lists the requirements for the Web Content Accessibility   Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0).  Appendix A lists a set of statements that the   Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) has agreed to   while writing WCAG 2.0.  These statements will help frame future decisions.    2. Added an Introduction. It says:  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) explains how to make   Web content accessible to people with disabilities. It was written for Web   content developers (page authors and site designers) and developers of   authoring tools. The primary goal of WCAG 1.0 is to promote accessibility.   However, following the guidelines in WCAG 1.0 will also make Web content   more available to all users.    Since the release of WCAG 1.0 as a W3C Recommendation in May 1999, the WCAG   WG has received feedback about the usability, understandability, and   applicability of the suite of documents.  This feedback is driving the   development of WCAG 2.0 and is captured as the Requirements for WCAG 2.0   (this document).    The goal of WCAG 2.0 is the same as 1.0:  to promote accessibility of Web   content.  The other goals listed in this document are:  Ensure that requirements may be applied across technologies  Ensure that the conformance requirements are clear  Ensure that the deliverables are easy to use  Write to a more diverse audience  Clearly identify who benefits from accessible content  Ensure that the revision is "backwards compatible    3. paragraph 2 of the Status section used to say:  This is a W3C Working Draft produced by the Web Content Accessibility   Guidelines Working Group. The purpose of this document is to outline the   requirements for the next version of the Web Content Accessibility   Guidelines. The working group encourages feedback about these requirements   as well as participation in the development of the revision by people who   have experience trying to create Web content that conforms to WCAG 1.0.    now it says:  This is a W3C Working Draft produced by the Web Content Accessibility   Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG). The purpose of this document is to   outline the requirements for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. The   Working Group encourages feedback about these requirements as well as   participation in the development of the revision by people who have   experience trying to create Web content that conforms to WCAG 1.0.    4. Requirement 1 used to read:  WCAG 2.0 will include requirements for:  Presentation (e.g., CSS and HTML, PDF)  Multimedia (e.g., SMIL, SVG, Flash)  Structure (e.g., HTML, MathML)  Metadata (e.g., RDF)  Interactivity (e.g., DOM, JavaScript)  Designing new languages (e.g. XML)    Now it reads:  WCAG 1.0 was written primarily for HTML documents.  Authors trying to apply   WCAG 1.0 to XML applications have had difficulty.  Thus, WCAG 2.0 should be   applicable across technologies such as:  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL)  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)  Math Markup Language (MathML)  Resource Description Framework (RDF)  Extensible Markup Language (XML) applications    5. expanded the acronyms for ERT and EO in the 1st paragraph under   requirement 2.    6. the first bullet under requirement 4 used to read:  Create accessible, innovative, internationalized Web sites.    now it reads:  Create accessible, innovative Web sites.    the 4th bullet now reads:  Document the assumptions that underlie the minimum requirements  (it used to say "underly")    7. The last paragraph under requirement 4 used to read  The number, length, and organization of the deliverables must meet the   different needs of these readers. As part of ensuring that the diverse   needs of readers are met, the WG will work closely with the Education and   Outreach Working Group.    now it reads (new sentence added to incorporate idea of "internationalized"   that was deleted from 1st bullet):  The number, length, and organization of the deliverables must meet the   different needs of these readers. The language used in the deliverables   should be as easy as possible to translate into other languages and   localized examples should be provided where possible. As part of ensuring   that the diverse needs of readers are met, the WG will work closely with   the Education and Outreach Working Group.    8. requirement 6 used to read:  A number of other materials and tools reference WCAG 1.0, such as ATAG 1.0,   the WCAG Curriculum, U.S. Government Section 508 Guidelines, AERT, Bobby,   etc. Therefore, a revision of WCAG 1.0 must not completely change the   definition of accessible content but clarify the complexities and fix the   specifics.    now it reads:  A number of other materials and tools reference WCAG 1.0, such as   specifications, evaluation tools, authoring tools, and government and   organizational policies. Therefore, WCAG 2.0 must not completely change the   definition of accessible content.    9. the first sentence in appendix a used to read:  The following are statements that the WCAG Working Group has reached   consensus on and will be using to build the new WCAG 2.0 Guidelines.    now it reads:  The following are statements that the WCAG Working Group has reached   consensus on as of the date of this document and will be using to build the   new WCAG 2.0 Guidelines.    10. N1 used to read:  N1 -that technology specific checkpoints should be normative    At yesterday's telecon we agreed we do not have consensus on that item. We   deleted it and replaced it with:  N1 -  [Deleted due to changes in structure]    11. N9 used to read:  N-9 Our normative portions would (as qualified) apply to sites in general.   Our informative portions can give information that may apply to sites in   general or to special targeted sites as long as they are clearly labeled.    now it reads (discussed at yesterday's telecon):  N9 - Normative portions apply to sites in general. Most informative   portions also apply to sites in general. However, some informative portions   may apply only to specially targetted sites and those informative portions   will be clearly labelled in the guidelines.    12. C5 used to read:  C5 - we WCAG should provide a way for people to see impact of items for   particular disabilities but it should not be used for conformance.    now it reads (got rid of "we"):  C5 -  WCAG should provide a way for people to see impact of items for   particular disabilities but it should not be used for conformance.    13. C7 used to read:  C7 - The success criteria (for a checkpoint) must be sufficient. (i.e. if   you do them you comply. You would not have to do anything not in the list   of success criteria.)    now it reads (discussed at yesterday's telecon):  C7 - The success criteria for a checkpoint must be sufficient; following   the success criteria should be all that is needed to claim conformance to   the checkpoint.    14. expanded the acronym for EARL in M1.    15. G2 used to read:  G2 - Accessibility and usability are intertwined and vary between people   and tasks. We think that our distinctions and decisions about normative or   importance will be based on something other than categorizing them as an   "accessibility" or "usability" items.    now it reads (got rid of the "an" before accessibility):  G2 - Accessibility and usability are intertwined and vary between people   and tasks. We think that our distinctions and decisions about normative or   importance will be based on something other than categorizing them as   "accessibility" or "usability" items.    16. G3 used to read:  G3 - User vs. User needs is something we need to look at on a case-by-case   basis, but it is also a test we need to apply to every normative   requirement anyway. Need to ask"If this done, is some group being cut out?"    now it reads:  G3 - User vs. user needs is something we need to look at on a case-by-case   basis, but it is also a test we need to apply to every normative   requirement. We need to ask ourselves, "If this is done, will some group be   cut out?"    17. A1 used to read:  A1 - The working group acknowledges that accessibility to everyone is not   possible. Our target is to make things as accessible to as many people as   possible given then need to have practical techniques and criteria. We will   expend our best effort to identify techniques, criteria and examples that   would cover the greatest range possible.    now it reads (changed "then need" to "the need", capped Working Group,   replaced "expend" with "make"):  A1 - The Working Group acknowledges that accessibility to everyone is not   possible. Our target is to make things as accessible to as many people as   possible given the need to have practical techniques and criteria. We will   make our best effort to identify techniques, criteria and examples that   cover the greatest range possible.

        Hello,    We currently have a separate CSS Techniques document.  Please refer to the   list of techniques documents currently under discussion/development:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20.html#techs    Note that the last time we generated a version of CSS Techniques was 16   July 2001 [1], but that I converted the source to xml (using the techniques   dtd) in August 2002 [2].    There has been some debate about a CSS chapter within each of the "host"   technologies (i.e., HTML, XML, SVG, SMIL, MathML, etc.) with a separate   CSS-specific document for overarching CSS techniques and themes.    Does this satisfy your question or are you driving at something else?    --wendy    [1]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-CSS-TECHS/  [2]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2002/08/css-tech.xml - note that this   is a very sparse document.  I did it this way to highlight where we are   missing information.  in other words, it is a sort of template for future work.

      Anne,    I have included the AU WG on my response to address the 2nd issue you raise.    My understanding of your message is:  1. in your experience, the children that you work with are less likely to   follow "in your face" URLs so therefore you support adding something to the   techniques document.    2. One way that you are able to create text links is using IE and FrontPage   reader and you've outlined those steps as a proposal to add to our   techniques document.    3. Another observation you have made is that children and perhaps also   people with CD and LD find shorter links easier to navigate.    I'll respond to each of these:  1. I'm glad we have some informal data to back up and provide more   rationale for avoiding "in your face" URLs.    2. Currently, we do not have any techniques that are specific to one   authoring tool.  People have requested this information but we have not   provided any yet.  Since these are both Microsoft products, I think it   would be more appropriate for them to produce something that we could point   to.  Ideally a document that shows how to work with their tools to follow   all of the WCAG checkpoints - ala Guideline 6 in the Authoring Tool   Accessibility Guidelines [1].  What do others think about this?  Does   Microsoft have documentation online that we can refer to from the   techniques to help people make the connection between WCAG and the tool   they are using?  What about other authoring tools?    3.  People in general seem to find shorter links easier to use - assuming a   link has been given enough context so that it's destination is clear.  User   Interface Engineering discusses link length in their book "Web Site   Usability: A Designer's Guide" which is based on a series of usability   studies.  Jakob Nielsen also discusses link length in his book "Designing   Web Usability."  Links that are too short can be ambiguous and confusing.

        Setting the scope for light-weight Web-based applications  By Bert Bos    <http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/webapps.html>    submission for <http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/index.html>W3C   Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      Please keep in mind that there are 65 WCAG checkpoints which means *at   least* 65 techniques in our document.  We often have more than one   technique for each checkpoint.    I would prefer if people keep the checkpoint number in the subject. I don't   care if its at the end or the front, but it is **very** useful to me.  As I   edit a checkpoint I can easily gather the other e-mail associated with that   checkpoint.  This reduces the number of times I may need to edit a   particular technique.  I am not often able to read and reacte to the e-mail   as it comes in.  Thus, I may be working on a whole week's worth of e-mail   at one time.  I can find all of the e-mail related to a particular   technique and synthesize a single proposal from my understanding of the thread.    I will try to make the e-mail that I send more readable for others by   referencing which version of the document we are discussing.    --wendy    At 03:53 PM 2/5/00 , Al Gilman wrote:  >There is a tradeoff between making an email message clear on its own and  >making it work with desktop tools in the process of editing a document.  >  >Jonathan wrote:  > >Subject: please put a precis in the header and/or at the top of the email  > >  > >I do like the way this discussion is going.  >  > >However I still complain about excessive use of "1.13" etc in my email/on  > >the wai site.

      Hello,    We have a teleconference scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday, 16 December,   4:00-5:00 Eastern, at +1-617-252-1038).    I propose that we discuss:  1.  proposed charter [1].  2.  proposed timeline for completing the charter [2].  3.  proposed end of charter report [3].    if we have time:  4. captions for audio clips  5. space and null alt-text      A couple of comments about the charter:  In my first drafts of the charter I included an activity that would review   the top 20 sites as rated by some portal.  I thought that this exercise   would help us identify current technique trends as well as start a dialog   between our group and the developers of the top 20 sites.  I had hoped that   this might result in the top 20 sites becoming more accessible, and perhaps   participation in the group by some of those developers.  However, others   felt this activity is more appropriate in EO.    I think we could contribute to the EO activity by going through this   exercise.  My main goal is to increase the accessibility of the Web by   working with developers of top sites as well as increasing the number of   developers on the list.  I think the major focus of the next phase of the   group is creating and testing techniques and a strong developer and   designer contingency will be key.    However, we have more than enough on our plate.  Therefore we may not want   to promise reviewing the top 20 sites if we find other ways to meet the   needs I have identified.  These needs have been documented in the charter.    I look forward to comments and review.  "hear" you all tomorrow,  --wendy    [1] charter http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html  [2] timeline  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/timeline.html  [3] report  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/end-charter2-report.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    At the beginning of April, Kynn described a tool and strategies that were   along a similar train of thought.  I am reposting this for consideration as   I found it very interesting.  The assistive technology could either give   the user a "semantic transformation" (such as the summarizers that were   floating around on the web a couple years ago) or a "graphical   transformation" based on language processing.    --wendy    >Resent-Date: Sat, 1 Apr 2000 20:28:31 -0500 (EST)  >X-Sender: kynn@ayla.idyllmtn.com (Unverified)  >X-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Pro Version 3.0.5 (32)  >Date: Sat, 01 Apr 2000 17:32:34 -0800  >To: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >From: Kynn Bartlett <kynn@idyllmtn.com>  >Subject: Kynn's Analysis of CD Web Accessibility  >Resent-From: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >X-Mailing-List: <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org> archive/latest/3324  >X-Loop: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >Sender: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org  >Resent-Sender: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org  >  >Having taken a vacation this last week, both physically and  >from the net, I've had time to consider the issues related to  >accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities.  >  >One key question I've been wrestling with has been "is this  >different than enabling access for people with other  >disabilities (e.g. those with mobility/dexterity, vision,  >or hearing impairments), and if so, why is this different?"  >  >It certainly has *felt* different to me, and so I've had to  >consider why exactly that difference may be.  >  >Here's what I concluded:  >  >      When creating a web page that can be used by people  >      with other disabilities, we are not making the page  >      -directly- accessible to them, we are making the page  >      accessible to their assistive technologies.  >  >For example, when I create a page that can be used by someone  >who is unable to see, I am not actually creating the sound  >files and sound-based navigation structure she needs in order  >to achieve accessibility; instead, I am ensuring that my page  >interacts properly with her screenreader and/or specialized  >web browser that can provide for her what she needs.  >  >To enable access for a user without mousing ability, I don't  >have to write a keyboard driver or explicitly program a  >javascript keyboard-based interface for my page; I simply need  >to make it compatible with the user's assistive technology.  >  >However, when dealing with people with cognitive disabilities,  >I'm not dealing with the assistive technology -- instead, I've  >got to make the page *directly accessible* to the user.  >  >This puts me in the position not of a web designer seeking to  >make his page interoperable with someone's access device, but  >instead, one meta-level *up* -- I -am- designing their assistive  >technology!  >  >I believe this helps explain many of the problems faced by the  >Web Accessibility Initiative regarding the issues related to  >CD accessibility -- putting us in the position of directly  >creating the interfaces.

Refer to Nick's recent message:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0031.html    - EARL 1.0. Refer to Sean's latest and greatest documentation:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0006.html    - Jim's EARL client  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0007.html  and the question that came up about combining results between EARL reports.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0009.html  Nick also brought it up in a separate thread a few days earlier:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0002.html  Combining reports is one of the major features of EARL and one of the   primary implementations we've been waiting for.    This thread also brings up the point of date not being sufficient to   identify a report uniquely, especially for content that is generated   dynamically.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Nov/0028.html    Are there other topics people would like to nominate for the   agenda?

        Hello,    Here are the possible dates for our F2F that is co-located with the CSUN   conference in L.A. CA USA in mid-March.  Please vote for the dates that you   would prefer:    1. The saturday/sunday *before* CSUN (15 and 16 March)  2. The sunday/monday *after* CSUN (23 and 24 March)  3. The sunday before and the sunday after (16 march and 23 march).  if you choose this option, we might set it up so that people don't have to   be at both (some people can't stay for the full week).  a possible division   of the agenda: cover guidelines/checkpoints on 16 march and techniques on   23 march.    The WAI IG is meeting the afternoon of 22 March (saturday).  People ought   to attend to discuss general WAI IG business.  It's also a good place for   us to get feedback about WCAG 2.0.

      Chris and Josh,    This is great!  I've begun a preliminary review of SSB Technologies InSight   (version 2.4 - couldn't download the latest - I'll have to talk with Tim   again).  The results that I have so far are at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/07/insight.rdf    In the quick 10 tests that I did, I found some interesting errors in InSight.    I have a few questions/suggestions about the ATR tool and test files.    1. If the tool being evaluated identifies the problem, but doesn't offer   the suggestion, does it pass?  For example, test file 1-1-1-f12 is a   horizontal rule image without alt-text.  InSight correctly identifies that   it is missing alt-text but doesn't suggest "horizontal rule."  The ATR tool   says, "Should trigger:  Image missing ALT text (suggest "horizontal rule").    I said that it passed it, since it did trigger.  Perhaps these ought to be   separate - the suggestion from the error detection.  I think it would be   good to know if the correct suggestion was made or if any suggestion was made.      2. Several of the test files do not say what should trigger.  e.g.,   1-1-10-f1, 1-1-12-f1, 1-1-14-f1, 1-1-14-f2, 1-1-14-f3, 1-1-14-f4    1-1-10-f1.xml  has a comment element while 1-1-1-f1.xml has a   suggested_message and an empty comment element.      3.  During my review I made comments about additional messages that InSight   was generating as I went along.  Those comments are not recorded in the   results.  Also, the comment field did not clear when I selected a new test   file (as I had expected it to do).  To write something new I had to delete   the text then write.  BUT none of that was captured.      Thanks for your work Chris and Josh!  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Hello,    Summary of this (rather long) message:  I summarized the assumptions that we made in yesterday's call and the W3C   Recommendation track.  I claim that technology-specific checkpoints as well   as a set of core checkpoints could be normative while the supporting code   examples and implementation details could be informative. To support my   point, I created a few core checkpoints, a few technology-specific   checkpoints, and suggestions for supporting discussions.    The issues and assumptions from yesterday's telcon:  1. It is preferable that people only interact with one layer of the   document.  We assume that in most cases, the one layer that developers will   work with is the technology-specific checkpoints (commonly referred to as   "layer 3" in yesterday's call).  2. It is therefore preferable that a person could claim conformance if they   have followed the technology-specific checkpoints.  3. However, our assumption yesterday was that the technology-specific   checkpoints might be updated frequently.  And, if updated frequently they   should be informative.  4. There is concern that informative technology-specific checkpoints would   not carry as much weight as we like.  It seems that developers need   something normative to claim conformance to.  5. The issue with publishing a normative document is how long it takes to   update.  We might not have the flexibility we need.    Therefore, I took an action item to investigate the possibilities of the   W3C process [1].    A document on the W3C Recommendation track usually goes through the   following steps:  1. Public Working Draft (should be updated every 3 months, can stay at this   level indefinitely and usually with several non-public working drafts in   between)  2. Last Call (It is suggested to last 3-4 weeks)  3. Candidate Recommendation (Criteria are set before entering this stage   and must be satisfied before the document moves on. This step can be   skipped if for some reason it is urgent to get to PR).  4. Proposed Recommendation (Mandatory 4 weeks minimum)  5. Sent to the directory (2 weeks)  6. Recommendation    If something has been published as a Recommendation and:  if only editorial clarifications or bug fixes are made, the document may be   republished without going through the process.  if a new requirement is added, the document has to go back through the process.    However, the question is, "where in the process does it return to - last   call or proposed recommendation?"  It appears that last year when HTML 4.0 was updated to HTML 4.01 it did not   go back to last call but went to Proposed Recommendation (on August 24,   1999 and then became a Recommendation on 24 December 1999).  A revised   version of CSS was published with  last year, but I have not tracked down   what process it went through.  Since there were only editorial changes it   is still CSS1 rather than CSS1.01.    The minimum time per the above calendar for publishing minor updates seems   to be 6 weeks.    The goal of making something normative is to provide a stable document. It   if changes often is it really "normative."  However, how often will   technology-specific documents realistically need to change?    Changes to technology-specifics seem to be based on a few things:  1. browser updates  2. spec changes  3. new ideas or work arounds  4. assistive technology updates    We had anticipated that the current Techniques document would be fairly   dynamic, yet it hasn't really changed too much or very often (we're just   now getting ready to publish a new note).  Therefore, I would like to   challenge the assumptions that we were making yesterday.    I think that we can make technology-specific checkpoints normative (and   therefore stable). I think that we can do this by separating the   technology-specific checkpoints from the techniques (informative - code   examples, explanations, screen shots, etc).    For example, for XHTML a few technology-specific checkpoints (normative)   might be:  Provide an "alt" attribute for every IMG element.  Provide a "longdesc" attribute for some IMG elements.  Provide text equivalents or descriptions within the content of all OBJECT   elements.  Associate each LABEL element with its INPUT element with the "for"   attribute (on the LABEL element).    A  core techniques document (informative) would discuss:  how to write text equivalents,  how to decide when to write a long description,  and how to write a long description.    While the HTML specific techniques (informative) would discuss:  examples of "alt" on IMG,  examples of "longdesc" on IMG,  the many uses of OBJECT with examples of each,  examples of associated LABEL and INPUT elements.    The HTML/XHTML spec won't change too much from here on out.  If it does, we   should be well aware of the changes before they happen.  They will all be   on the same W3C schedule as we are!  Browser updates might change the   priority or preference of some items, but how much?  If a new browser   supports cool features but no one uses it yet, does that change what we   suggest developers do?    As always, the wording is really rough in these "straw" proposals, but I   hope you get the general idea of what we might be able to make normative   versus informative.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#Recs    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      in my previous message I proposed    <BLOCKQUOTE>  for spacer images, use alt=" ".  </BLOCKQUOTE>    I just realized I had a bug in the   examples.  Therefore, I am   considering updating my proposal.    The  HTML 4 spec doesn't say much about   from what i can find.  Other   than it is a "non-breaking space." [1]  I don't see any suggestions for   usage.

        Before adding new issues to the issues list [1], I summarized the issues   received on the 22 August 2002 WD of WCAG 2.0 [2].    The next step is to sort, divide, and combine the comments to end up with   the following groups of comments:  1. by checkpoint  2. by overarching issue (e.g., we received quite a few "general comments")  3. editorial comments that can be dealt with by the editors.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/10/2002/09/wcag20-issues.php3  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/10/comments-WD-WCAG20-20020822.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

        What I'm proposing is that a technique is a specific strategy (e.g., "Use   the title element to provide a unique title for a page") and that we   provide supplementary information for that technique (e.g., examples,   descriptions, etc.).    Thus, a checklist is list of techniques.   A checklist does not contain the   supplementary information for that technique.  --wendy    At 02:53 PM 1/28/2003, Gregg Vanderheiden wrote:  >That works ok for the techniques doc,  but for the checklists we need  >checklist items.  >  >There may be 3 or 5 techniques for a success criteria.

      The basic premise of non-text content was described well by Charles:    "Something that doesn't rely on writing to communicate its content.  Normally, a picture, some sound, a movie, and so on. "    Although, the UAAG defn is useful as well.    "Text content" is content that is composed of one or more     text elements.    Jason's suggestion is logical, but again not quite as simple as I am hoping   for:  Non-text content: information which does not satisfy the definition of  text content, but which is meant to be perceived and interpreted primarily  by a human being (sounds, graphics, etc.).    Therefore all definitions rely on defining "text" Perhaps the thing to do   is write the UAAG defn of text in less technical terms.  It is   understandable that the UAAG defn needs to be more technical, and I would   like to reference it for those in our audience who do want something   specific and complete. For our audience we need something less technical.    How about these definitions:    Text: words presented in written language intended for people to read.    (is "word" internationalized? is that why UAAG had to use "characters"? if   that's the case, what if we just drop "words presented in" and leave the   defn as "written language intended for people to read.")    Non-text content: Information presented without written language intended   to be understood by people.    --wendy    At 10:30 AM 8/2/01 , Ian B.

      Michael,    In response to your suggestion:  "Technique 2.1.A - User Notification for color use  Also need to trigger if we detect any HTML or CSS color settings"  [from ]    I added the following bullet to the list in 2.1.A:  as well as the HTML elements and attributes listed in the next technique   (2.2.A).    since i didn't think we needed to list them for both checkpoints.    Also, I added the following to the list in 2.2.A  <quote>  STYLE element or attribute CSS properties:  - color  - background-color  - background-image  - background  </quote>    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Graham,    Sounds great. Thanks for volunteering.    We discussed this a bit at the OZeWAI conference and I had promised to draw up the image that I showed to the audience.  Attached is a sketch in svg and jpeg.     Description:  We usually talk about accessibility and usability on the same continuum.  Some have said that one is the subset of another.  However, what if we look at the intersection of two continuums?  They are orthogonal to each other.      One continuum is "ability": at one extreme there are no restrictions (possible?) and at the other are  physical, sensory, situation, device, etc. restrictions.    The other continuum is usability: at one extreme is "usable" at the other is "not usable."    I'm not sure it is a sound idea, but it's just a thought to add to the mix.  I look forward to what you come up with.  --wendy    At 07:27 AM 1/25/02, goliver@accease.com wrote:  >Wendy  >Issue number 55   >  >http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html#55  >  >talks about the accessibilty / usability conundrum.  >  >I would like to volunteer to do the following  >  >1.

        Hello all,    We did not have an opportunity to discuss this during today's telecon, but   we need to know who is interested in attending a WCAG WG face-to-face in or   around Tokyo on 21 and 22 November.  We are still working to find a host   but need to make some sort of announcement tomorrow because of the 8 week   deadline in the W3C process document.    Please complete and send the following two sentences.  Send this in a   private email to me.  1. I [do/do not] support having a WCAG WG meeting in Japan 21 and 22 November.  2. I [am/am not] likely to attend a WCAG WG meeting in Japan in November.

      Based on today's discussion [1] I revised the charter [2] and timeline [3].    The major changes in the charter and timeline:    1.  the testing procedures are not a deliverable but a matter of how we   work.  therefore it has been removed from the list of deliverables and the   timeline, but we mention testing where we discuss the Techniques document.    2.  the impact matrix is not longer a deliverable but mentioned as a   supporting document of the Guidelines since it could get incorporated into   the guidelines either per checkpoint or as an appendix.  we don't want to   promise an extra deliverable.    3. in the coordination section, we mention mobile and I18N explicitly and   have pulled the piece about CG out into the intro (it was in the paragraph   about PF).    I would like to send the charter to the Director next week.  Please post   comments before next Wednesday (December 22).  Note that the timeline and   end of charter report [4] are supporting materials for the charter, thus I   would also like comments on them before Wednesday as well.

      Jon,  No these are not out of scope.    The following requirement does not mention scripting specifically, but I   believe it covers it, "eneralized across technologies: WCAG 1.0 primarily   addresses the needs of an accessible HTML page. WCAG 2.0 needs to encompass   emerging technologies such as XML-based languages (e.g., SVG, SMIL, MathML,   etc.)."    we are dealing with improved navigation markup now. I sent a proposal to   the UA and WCAG mailing lists on Tuesday.    Also, I believe those issues are covered by the following open issues cited   in the requirements draft document:  "-Accurately identify what works, what may not, and why - test techniques,   give results. ideas should be verified in some way. usability testing as we   draft. how collect data? Deal with the "until user agents" clause which   causes confusion.  -specify user needs. even if we don't have an answer, we still need to   describe the problem and whether the need is being met.?  -Guidance to create pages for people with cognivite and learning   disabilities, primarily navigation issues."    --wendy      At 08:31 AM 4/5/00 , Jon Gunderson wrote:  >Wendy,  >I did not see anything about scripting or improved navigation markup in the  >requirements document.

        Hello,    I took an action item to draft templates for meetings. I came up with three:  1. Planning meeting template - to help organize information for an event. [1]  2. Topic-specific event template - basically an "agenda" for an event. [2]  3. Topic-specific proceedings template - a means to gather information   after an event. [3]    These are labelled "topic-specific" because we had talked about two   different types of events:  1. "around the world" which would be a general discussion about a variety   of current research  2. "topic-specific" which focuses on a specific research topic (e.g., our   first event is a topic-specific event focusing on collaboration).    Thoughts?

      Let's also discuss Karl and Sharon's  comments on other people looking at   EARL and applications of it.    --w      Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 6 August 2001 at the regularly   scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what   time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910    Agenda for Monday:  - ATR tool and test files, although Chris won't be at the meeting. I   thought we could go through some of the test files.  If anyone has gone   through them all (Josh? <grin/>) we can discuss what else we need.  I've   only been through a small portion.  They're really good.    What is the cross-section with WCAG test files?    - EARL that ATR generates.  What will the tool look like that collates all   the data from the ATR?  A comparison table (that linearizes well) of tools   by checkpoint is what I had in mind. What are your thoughts?    - List of existing tools.  How can we make it easier to read and use?  Will   this be replaced by the comparison table  just suggested?

      I think we need to check for all of them.  Some people may use a style   sheet for some things and FONT for others.  Therefore, going through all of   the checks seems appropriate.  --w    At 05:24 PM 2/22/00 , Michael Cooper wrote:  >No, I wasn't suggesting we remove the evaluation to check for inline or  >external stylesheets.

Note that the call will be on the Tobin bridge (+1 617.252.7000), WCAG calls are usually on Longfellow (+1 617.252.1038).     I will take minutes on IRC. This will also give people a chance to participate by IRC if unable to phone in.   server: irc.w3.org  port: 6665  channel: #wai-wcag    Agenda:  - Timeline for next draft   - Divvying up the work    Details:  ** Timeline   I would like to see how much we can accomplish before the F2F meeting in Australia.  We also need to think about when we will publish our first public working draft.    ** Divvying up the work  As I see it, we have the following needs.  People can do more than one of these roles and more than one person can do each role:  - creating examples  - testing examples (variety of browsers, platforms, assistive technologies, settings, etc.)  - documenting examples  - editing and piecing together  - maintaining an open issues and bug reports list     Initially on our plate:  - incorporating edits and comments received since the last draft (July 2001)  - incorporating edits and comments received since last public Note was published (november 2000)  - creating examples for each technique  - creating success criteria or some way to test each technique  - test each technique to determine how it works, where it breaks, how it breaks, etc.    Comments and edits received since last draft:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0082.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0087.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0115.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0089.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001OctDec/0085.html    Comments and edits received since November 2000 draft - too many to list right now.  This could be someone's first task - to collect all of the feedback and questions sent to w3c-wai-gl and w3c-wai-ig over the last 2 years and make an issues list.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

        Thanks, Roberto.    >I noticed that the complementary colour (directly opposite to each other in  >the colour wheel) combination has the highest contrast.  >http://www.webwhirlers.com/colors/combining.asp    In my experience, red and green are considered complementary [1,2,3,4].  In   the resource that you cite red and green don't appear to be   complementary.  Another source names the complementary pairs as [6]: green   and magenta, blue and amber, and blue-green and red.    If red and green are complementary, there is at least one exception to the   complementary rule: don't use green and red together (unless it is ok to   miss the information presented in an overlap of the two colors).    What about the other definitions of complementary colors? Is it ok to   overlap red and blue-green? Reading Aries's pamphlet [5] it seems that red   on blue-green is OK as long as you use dark red against light blue-green   and don't use light red on dark blue-green.  Joe's book seems to support   this when he says, "Don't set green on red or red on green....unless: The   items have considerable difference in brightness....If the lightness   contrast is _indisputably_ high, you've solved the problem." [7]    So, it seems to me that the "complements rule," while short and sweet,   doesn't quite stand on its own.  Brightness needs to be part of the equation.    --wendy    [1] http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_complementary.html  [2] http://www.colormatters.com/colortheory.html  [3] http://painting.about.com/library/blcompcolors.htm  [4] http://www.artsconnected.org/toolkit/encyc_colorwheel.html  [5] http://www.lighthouse.org/color_contrast.htm  [6] http://www.gweep.net/~prefect/pubs/iqp/node69.html  [7] http://joeclark.org/book/sashay/serialization/Chapter09.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      Tim,    This weeks MSDN "DHTML Dude" [1] says,  <blockquote>  The Internet Explorer team frequently receives requests to allow users to   disable the appearance of pop-up windows. Yet this puts us in a dilemma: Do   we allow developers the freedom to use this potentially powerful tool to   offer great solutions to their customers? Or do we restrict the platform so   developers cannot misuse this functionality? The Internet Explorer team has   taken the stand that except where security concerns are present, we should   allow developers as much flexibility as possible to build powerful   applications, without undue restrictions.  </blockquote>    WCAG is relying on users being able to control windows opening and   closing.  This is covered by UAAG 5.3.  Does the IE team realize that UAAG   is talking about configurability of the user agent rather than restricting   what it is possible for developers to do?    In other words, pop-up windows can be very useful.  They can increase   usability if you are able to use them as intended.  However, they can   really muck things up if you can not use them as intended.  Therefore, we   don't want to restrict developers from using them, but we do want to let   people configure the use of pop-up windows.  For example, opera will let   you say "do not open windows in a new window."    So, can you tell us if the IE team is willing to consider this if it is   about user configurability rather than restricting developers?    Thank you.

      Hello,    Checked out RetroAccess today.  Anyone else played with this?  http://www.retroaccess.com/access_enable.cgi    Here are some thoughts based on a quick check. I used the demo version to evaluate cnn.com.    Positives:  1. Summaries are helpful. You can drill down as much as you like.  2.  Saves info about human checks. (would be cool if they were using EARL!).  One thing I like is that if it finds the same image multiple times, it will propagate the user's action to all of those images.    Negatives:  1. There seems to be quite a few things it doesn't check for and it doesn't seem to give the user explicit enough directions for them to determine if they pass or not.  2. It would be cool if it drew the parallels to WCAG 1.0 and also perform checks or offer tips for the P1 checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 that are not covered by 508.  3. The cnn page uses lots of tables for layout.  The tips associated with all of the tables the tool identified says,   <quote>Possible data table without headers   Header rows and columns allow interpretive programs to read the data in the table appropriately. Use the "th" tag to identify the meanings of each row and column  </quote>  Since they are layout tables, th is not needed. This summary makes it sound like th is required on all tables.    Just a few quick thoughts,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      I was working on this problem last year.  The work-around that I created   used style sheets and scripting.    When scripts are on, the submenu would appear after a mouse click (rather   than mouse over) or a keyboard event (pressing the enter key).  This event   caused the submenu, as defined as a style sheet "layer," to be displayed.    When scripts are off style sheets are also not loaded and the submenus   appear with the menu bar in an outline.    refer to http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/mwc    an outdated write up is available at:   http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/~chisholm/dhtml/  note that it has not been   touched in over a year <wendy blushes from embarrasment>.  I have been   hoping to get back to it for a while but have not.    comments?  anyone want to play with it? help me bring it up to date?  --wendy    At 10:10 AM 4/6/00 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Interesting question.  >  >At the moment there is no way to make this happen on the client side - you  >always need some kind of server-side solution (such as the submenu, although  >there are fancier things you could do which would hit your server harder).  >  >You could make this more directly accesssible for those with script-capable  >browsers by adding an onfocus method, but I need to think for a minute how  >that works for turning things off (since the focus will shift to a bit of the  >submenu...).  >  >It might not be very easy to do this in HTML.

Minutes from Friday's WCAG meeting will be sent separately.    --w      01 March 2001 F2F meeting minutes (AU/ERT/WCAG)  The minutes for both the morning and afternoon sessions are contained in   this document. In the a.m. the AU WG and ERT WG met along with several   visitors. The p.m. session was a joint meeting between AU WG, ERT WG, WCAG   WG and visitors.    Summary of action items, resolutions, and open issues  ?       Resolved: WCAG Will consider EARL as basis for conformance. Places   this on the open issues lsit.  ?       Resolved: WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each   requirement can be referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test   results to be associated with it.  ?       Resolved: add to AU issue list: add requirement that tools import   EARL. note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear that EARL has   firmed up.  ?       Action CMN take issue about UA checking EARL statements about a   page to ERT and UA.  ?       Issue: implications on EARL as to how to express for UA.  ?       Resolved: WCAG will adopt those aspects of AERT into HTML   techniques that are relevant.  ?       Resolved: do this type of meeting again at a plenary like this.

Susan Lesch - W3C, review for WCAG    EARL  LK Language used to describe if web content is accessible. more general for   other types of testing. comes up with vocabulary that may be as wide as   possible. the examples that are canned deal with accessibility of web   pages. scenarios for uses of EARL /* link */ We want to get specific about   vocabulary.  LK In web accessibility, there are many places where the judgement has to   be made by a person. e.g. an image with alt-text. If you have an image of a   cow and the image is a horse, you need a person to recommend what the   alt-text should be.  LK 1st scenario - person gets a report. need way to combine comments from   various people or tools. compare results to one or more standards - in the   states such as 508 vs WCAG. Ideally, a language to translate between   standards. A corporation may have their own standards.  CS Discussion in WCAG of a conformance schema, what's that about?  CMN Instead of conformance to guidelines at level X, have finer-grained or   partial conformance. e.g., I use a mouthstick, there are 9 checkpoints in   UAAG that are critical to me but don't care about visual checkpoints. Can I   use this system to do that. one goal of using RDF, is to make sure you can   do that.  DD The 3 WAI guidelines are for web content, user agent, authoring tool -   what it means to be accessible for each. We have been good at specifying   conformance to each guideline. Each have checkpoints with priorities. There   is a conformance claim you make, Level A etc. (DD explains). In terms of   the accessibility report, we have a way to point into our spec that we can   directly reference. The problem is made complex by the requirement of human   judgement. We can not automate everything. If you co nsider SVG test suite   it is harder to point at testable assertion, but the test is look at   something - is the circle red. It is more objective at looking at assertion   but harder to point at what is the purpose of the test. This language will   have to take into account both kind of evaluation.  LK We have a problem of specifiying conformance in SVG, are there other   comments on that before we move on?  RN From the implementation side, if you break it into qualitative verus   quantitative, when we write tests, we have to document our requirements. I   would like to see a requirement based guidelines, where i can easily see   subjective or not. if quantitative i can write a test for that. otherwise,   what a space for comments or someone else to read.  LK For qualitative judements, in addition to a statement would you want a   scale?  RN feasible, but still human judgement. 1,2,3 can say qualitative. if p3   and qualitative, i may not have resources to do that. how do you get buy in   from the retail side. have to get it as easy as possible. get a quick hit.  CMN Two threads coming together: how do you test something against a test   suite. when we looked at this, rdf seemed a good pick since it let you deal   in things with URIs. if your test suite is 10K cases and each is a page,   and requires a human. as long as you have what needs to be done described   with a URI, then using RDF can say, "this conforms." ATAG gives tests for   how to determine conformance. 1. can you insert an image? 2. can you give   an equivalent? each has a URI.  LH Unlike accessibility standards, we don' thave a clear set of test   assertions. In practise, I synthesize those where implied. You extract a   doc fromt he spec which is test assertions. then you apply those same   processes to the intermediate document.  DD you create a test of chekcpoints?  LH You have to deduce them.  LK You can imagine a lang where each output statement refers to a   particular test, or imagine that it points to something more atomic then   derive if particular checkpoints are produced. You can say this image meets   checkpoitn 1.1 or alt-text exists. then you have another set of rules that   says, 1.1 is ... and in 508 it's ... i wonder if that would be aof   ofrmalizing that.  CMN In the toy that danbri and i made took advantage of that. we had atomic   tests with rules. if you meet all p1's then you meet the atomic test which   is wcag level A.  CS Would it be useful to create markup to define those standards? A way to   describe why want test and rules for what test against.  CMN The user interface is the key bit.  CS Some people will do it directly in XML with a text editor, some people   will want a GUI.  DD I would like to hear from lynn or lofton, we're not inventing something   new here. People have been working on results to tests. They were specific   to a testing technology or specific technology. OASIS has come up with XSLT   evaluation. The etc people have an ISO framework for presenting test   result. keep in mind there are specification of requirement.  LK As people bring up requirements, I want to list them here. Is there a   meta requirement.  CMN Derive a result from other results.  DD These look like requirements for harness rather than language.  RN The language has to generate a report. Also add, modify, delete and   change my report. I don't care what it does, what I want is a report that I   can hand to management. With 508, the coformance is up to each agency to   decide how they will handle it. It applies to corporations and companies.   No one wants a document, it can be supoenaed. You have to have a report.   Who are the players and the end result?  DDimitriadis In specifying DOM tests, the language is indpendent of adding   mechanisms to the test suite. You extend your test suite rather than the   language.  DD Have to be clear not to confuse the language (keep track of test   results) with pretty output. Another language is the language to express   the test. WIll find lots of same data in the result.  Lofton An ad hoc design for SVG work. Similar to test expression language   that NIST has done. It's simple XML grammar that encapsulates the test   purpose, the checkpoints (operator script). Descriptive prose on what you   should see, what should happen, how to issue pass/fail.  LR If you are doing conformance, when you test for it, it has to trace   itself back to a requirement in the spec. You are bound in scope to what   the spec says. Our test suites are based on the same philosphy. We have   test assertions (your checklist), then test purposes and cases. We   represent this in a DTD. Easy to add new tags. All tags have an   identification, purpose, owner, etc. Lots of identification info. You can   generate almost any kind of report you want. On the harness, you can always   view the source code, find the test requirement, link to that clause in the   spec. It's not like a formal language.  PJ The title EARL is what I thought we were working on, but when I hear   "test language" and "reporting lagnuage" I am concern about scope.  LK Testing is expansion of evaluation?  PJ test language is source of running the test. EARL says there is an URI   for the test thatmaps to a requirement. When we specify language of the   test, perhaps too low level. Want to make sure that things scale. Want to   scale at different points. if I have a checkpoint that syas "provide alt   for content." different ways to do it. can say do or don't vs. having test   id's for what i can do to validate.  LH I think the weakest point in our work is the expression of results. I've   seen everything from our earliest suites (a pad of paper), to work with DOM   where you get a visual highlighted result back (indicating pass/fail).   That's what itnerested me in this work. Not sure see the distinction   between evalution and report. Report is result of running evaluation.  LK Evaluation is something that could be read by an authoring tool as well   as particular report.  JT One way I envision this being used, if we have a number of different   evaluation tools and repair tools, a language to express what the authroing   tool evaluates and repairt, then can match up report with a repair tool   that repairs those pieces. Report could contain the EARL.  PJ Making conformance claims is different than results of tests.  CMN Testing is good for feedback on the spec.  DD Scenarios where person does not know how to fix, all you may know is   that hte browser has a problem. The repair info is valuable in others it is   irrelevant. Therefore separated in the language.  DDimitriadis Description of test could be x language y technologies. We   want one eval language, so yes separate. While specifying DOM, if write   atomic tests, e.g. I want to test 1.2.3 it is easy to do a conformance   rating. You generate result then put indication on result. We would like to   have scenario driven tests, "a user wants to add 5 lines of text and change   the screen, etc." Can not express is atomic points. Therefore, output   language probably not output. Put this on the agenda. Capture things based   on prose descriptions.  CMN The repair info that you might carry and ultimately the value is so you   can use it to fix tings. the repair comes out of the tests not the   language. make sense to make sense to make enough use of language that can   say, "here is the test. here's what it says about how to fix." this outside   scope of language itself. I used RDF because the test becomes a URI. I'd   like to see us talk about what the language might look likt and what RDF   might do for us.  MRK I don't see a problem with the language containing more info. The UI   can sort it out. Put info about what needs to be tested, what has been   tested, Advice for how to repair, show in different place.  KD Possible to make scenario based on atomic test. Can we establish   relationship between test and scenario.  CMN We used RDF to describe and needed inference engine.  DDimitriadis Writing tests or results?  CMN Ennumerate tests. Then ennumerate rules for combining tests. If you   pass 1,2,3 you get stamp A.  PJ Very faimilar with XML, don't know RDF. How does it relate to XML.  MRK Scope of the tests? Explain part of the document needs a test and the   whole doc and then the site?  CMN Anything that has a URI - a single element, a whole site.  MRK Put them all together.  RN In my informal survey, there are 1 in 50 that state in contracts: use   HTML 4. don't want to bind themselves. Need to carry on explanation why   something fails. need good examples. easy to read. one centralized tool: do   HTML, do x. One access point. re: test conditions: implementation issue is   that there are over 40 browsers where you can't turn javascript on/off or   css. if make test condition, "now turn off css" or "invert colors." then   you don't rely on how a browser works. it will tell you how.  LK We've been hearing about meta requirements. In terms of pinning down how   and if use RDF. Which of these considerations are teh key things we should   focus on.  AB Why would you consider using RDF? XML?  RS This a.m's discussion is about what you want to describe and how to   point people to more info. In the course of describing these things, you'll   figure out which concepts to encode. RDF and variety of notations will do   in a variety of ways. must first figure out what want to express.  LK Ground rule: as we talk about general requirements, it should be   accompanied by a concrete example.  CS Like to see output importable by bug tracking systems. What line of   code, test, etc. If you end up with 1,000 reports.  LK Want something that could attach any sort of machine readable info?  CS Want to see output, may be a tool issue. Bobby does this, when you get a   report.  CMN Why RDF instead of XML? Wanted to refer to anything in the universe as   a test. RDF model, X has relationship Y to Z. X, Y, Z are URIs.  LK How does that grab you?  AB Right. Seems that people needed clarification.  RS When LK and I talked about this. One question that we thought we might   want to answer was to describe the e-mail traffic over the last few weeks.   Ultimately, what we do with this will be expressable in XML (i.e. no angle   brackets in my description) rather the mechanism. I drew this example to   tie to the N3 description. The notion is that we have stuff. Each oval is a   thing. One is "pat" two don' thavfe names. there is a relationship between   pat and the 1st unknown thing called "child." imagine that the objects   we're talking about are some bit of markup that exists on the web. the   thing on the left is an XHTML markup. it has an img element that fails one   of your tests. #img failsReqruiement http://www.w3.org/some-wcag#p1.   document and conformance claim that is being failed. what is the   conformance test? that's for you to define. prose is good for human   readers, not for machines. What else can we say? We add relationships   between the conformance tests and what repair tools can do. You get to   describe the relationships, their names, their semantics. We can name   anything. failsRequirement is a name of a concept. it will have a URI that   you can follow to find out what it means. We can find out info about any   thing in this relationship. To make it easier to express what's going on in   this image, we have RDF and N3 that we can express it in.  /* go to pat example with 2 children example in N3 primer LINK */  RS What are the attributes of tests that we want people and machines to   discover? What does this relationships mean? How we write them in e-mail,   we need to agree on notation but focus on concepts. Don't spend a lot of   time on syntax. Further info is who made the claim, what did they base it   on, what tool decided it was the relationship that exists, etc. Let's   define the concepts then go to the RDF spec.  CMN What makes this useful in the real world? The use case that PJ and NIST   have. Do testing, get results, etc. Another is Jutta's. If a small shop may   have 8 tools, if larger have 8 departments. What kinds of tools exist?  RN Lots of tools exist. Test conditions will come upon the tools and pages.   We need to prioritize what we do first.  JT seems to be an open issue about what EARL will actually be used for.  DD Here is a vocabulary of things to express.  testinfo - framework (wcag, svgspec, htmlsyntax), test id, test purpose,   code?, manual y/n  result info - individual result (url pass/fail, confidence level, syntax   error line)  repair ino - (optional)  run info - contraints platform, operator instructions (merge EARL Language   with harness language)  are there additional items we should store and process? /* get rationale   and requirements from DD */ perhaps syntax error line is based on something   more generic.  LR Under result info, I would like to see person info as well as date tests   are run. It is important to note that these reports can be used in   different purposes and ways. Dependin gon if i'm going to repair or as a   report to claim conformance, the type of info i get out of the report or   how i use the report will be different. think about how used to make sure   it's all covered.  LK After break let's flesh out addtional info that we want here.  /* break - most of the RDF folks leave */  /* DD changes "schema" displayed on screen on the fly to incorporate   comments */  RS notation and syntax are not user interface. The purpose of the syntax is   to exchange stuff between tools.  RN In two week sin new orleans is a conference by carnegie mellon. seems to   be synergy.SEI - Software engineering institute. Model for how you do   software engineering. Those are foundations for building software.  RS the way you specify the date of the result and the page what information   do we want to record.  LK The question is do we want to record an individual date and stamp for   each element? Some images change. for example, banner ads will change.  RS Test date applies to all.  WC Not necessarily. Test could be on an element or even attribute level.   Tool could only care about one or other.  RN code on the page, versus what's on the page.  CS Separate test from subject of test. Subjectmight be page or image,   runnin ghte sam etest.  WC Harness?  DD framework of interaction that leads you to a result. there are languages   to express how you move from page to page. The test info is part of the   harness.  LK The question on the floor: what does the test mean adn what is the scope   of these thigns?  CMN The scope of the test is whatever you are making the assertion about.   it should be a requirement at an atomic level at an individual object, or   page, or whatever atom you can think of.  KB We need to say that something applies to more than one URL. e.g., ,in   alt-text applies not only to image file but image tag. assertion of   alt-text is about 2 things.  LK good point. let's get to that point after this one.  CS It seems that that is not a test. The test is what you do. If you are   testing a site, you might test index.html (subject) test is "does it   conform" don't wan to mix those in a single term. suggest s wording change?   test case - do these steps, and test object.  CMN Think we're in agreement except on terminology.  JT 2 pieces of inof that relate to test: what the outcome is and how we're   testing it.  JR Instead of something fails, it's that "it fails on the basis of the test."  JT What is the test testing for?  RN Trying to describe test conditions.  CS language should express both automatic and manual tests.  CMN In one sense there is a test that you run. it says "open browser, turn   on the feature, make it happen." that is test case info. result info says,   "thi si sthe verson, browser, etc." Or test case "go to this store to this   shelf and buy the 3rd box...etc." whatever it is, you need the instructions.  CS I have seen this factored effectively: test case - what you have to do   again later, result - what happened.  CMN Are we testing rendered stuff or code? 1 - http.w3.org/image does the   alt-text work? human result. 2. validator says some element fails some   requirement of html spec. completely machine run. code level. don't think   we are writing the test language, we're discussing what we expect to be in   it. ratehr the result language.  KB Generalize platform to context.  RS Don't get rid of details like platform - will help you keep track of   details.  PJ Depends on the test you are doing.  RN I see 2 issues. we're all users. perhaps we're getting caughtu pon test   methodology. we're trying to show our wish list. can we brainstorm what we   want, then we could talk to a test engineer for the best approach. best way   can change - test case/test suite, etc. what do we want to accomplish?  RS Don't worry too much about packaging. I suspect that one objective is to   capture as much info as we can so we can precisely reproduce the test.   Focus on what data needs to be captured and for whom? don't fall into the   trap of generalizing from one detail. Capture as much detail as comes out   of the brainstorm.  JT We need to address what will the info be attached to. Describe the   results. Scenario: i head company x, we have a document that shows how to   conform to 508, must do these 10 things. i want to find a test tool that do   these things (perhaps more than one tool). then want to repair them. i then   find tools to help me repair these things. need description of evaluation   tool and repair tool and what they test or repair.  CS In a bug report i want to see: the environment (the context that the   tester believes are important - might be platform, browser, etc.),   reproduction steps, date test run, version of code aganst which run, steps   of the test, how make it happen, the expected behavior, observed behavior,   optional things - general comments, line number, messages created by   system, copy of code, screen shots. for interactive testing, but could be   applied to automated testing. e.g. reproduction steps: run page x against   schema y. expected results: i get this file with these results.  LK sequence of steps looks new.  CS If a test is not reproducable, is an error on the tester. expected   results still not captured.  LH Should be in test case info.  CS actual code is not there. image 3 could now be image 5.  CMN Only if you've changed teh page.  DD Could also have copy of subject of test.  CS Likely thta the test is run on monday and person who fix won't get to   until friday and will change by then. won't always be available, e.g.   coming from a cgi.  MC Line of code may not be approach. Could have 10 images on one line.  CS Enough geeky info so that developer can find it easily.  RN Specific test condition: if doing test for wcag, could pick up info in   browser, what about screen readers that dn't provide that info? would we   have a box for other devices?  CS Suggest discuss at tomorrow's meeting to discuss context.  LK Let's capture everything.  RN Other device.  CMN I want to talk about tools in general. I want to know what tools exist   already  KB We need to be able to include a cc/pp profile.  LK Can you make that a specific case of something more general?  KB All the things we're talkingabout as devices and platforms, one way to   do it is cc/pp but not only way.  RS Partly a question of how much you snapshot.  PJ concerned about things changing.  RS recommend a practise that when refer to test case, if we change test   case give changed version diff identifier. how much histrory do you want to   record. propose in each circumstance how to record change info.  RN Do we have the export to another tool?  DD requirement listed. just write a parser.  CS Does require some requirements.  DD Might account for steps in the form. may nt have the data.  CS For these sytems, be invalid and not be imported  CMN A value of including stuff by reference is you can ignore it by   reference as well.  MM if there isn't some way to extend this than how we're envisioning, it   won't be useful to all.  LK Doesn't this get into what RS was talking about? The benefit of   implementin gin RDF is that you can extend it.  RS Right. having a flexible structure, rather than a fixed DTD..most DTD   tools break. suspect want a structure where developers can include   structure of own w/out interfereing with other tools.  LK Is this captured here?  DD Part of the framework. It is a requirement.  CS agree has to be flexible. think the verbs should be user definable. may   only care about pass/fail, or perhaps something richer. might want to look   at modularization. perhap automated module and manual module.  DD Captured in subclasses - page/ataga/uaag/suite/bugtrack.

JW Right, that's what we agreed up on in WCAG a few weeks ago.  CMN The issues seem mostly techniquey, but valuable to go through them.   Spend 2 minutes on each of them or 2 minutes and agree to postpone. Useful   from AU perspective for how WCAG will approach them.  JT Valuable piece of going through today, might relate to revision of WCAG.  WC move that we either limit our time, we have 3 groups here and more   interesting issues to discuss.  JT limited discussion at beginning? 1 limited at end? 5    EARL and WCAG  LK Are tehre people here who have not heard about EARL? Briefly, it is a   machine-readable representation of evaluating a web page. Could contain   suggestions for repair. Applications: raw form that would go into a report   tool. Several different EARLs, conditions, could be merged into one report.   (human readable). also fed into an authoring tool for convienient mechanism   to give tool list of what to repair. in terms of WCAG, there are 2 possible   ways it could impact WCAG. if we assume only used with WCAG, then each   statement could point into techniques (in terms of 2.0) and then give   "passes/fails" or other rating. Another appraoch is for EARL to produce   lower level statements that don' thave checkpoints in them. e.g. "alt text   is missing." Rule sets that take that as input and in the context of WCAG   that violates 1.0 or 1.4. or 508 ruleset. with 1st apprach, wcag would have   machine-readabvle reference. possible to point into wcag. instead of plain   text, in terms of HTML it would say "this is missing an attribute." on the   other hand if EARL reflects more fundamental facts from which you derive   checkpoints, then need rule base to convert to WCAG statements. then, who   writes the rule base and is it infomrative or normative?  CMN Interpretting that into checkpoints. working out how to do a test of   your spec.  RN Timeline for implementation of EARL?  LK Nothing has been committed to?  RN We have people interested in EARL. Talking to Karl Dubost, he said there   was a QA conformance meeting in late march.  CMN I will be there to represent EARL.  LK We are interested in those people joining the effort.  RN One tool on the interest group does a WCAG conformance guideline test.   Will there be correlation?  LK This is a format for out put of tools, not a tool.  CS One bullet point of th eEARL proposal is to compare results to one or   more standards. e.g. internal intranet sites. sounds like something like   specML. If feed a spec in, it has to be machine-readable. what would that   look like? It would be a wonderful thing to have.  CMN COmpare results, isn't new. use an rdf thing. does not provide testing   language. a separate project.  CS How do comparison?  CMN When do the tests, ability to record test and say what test was.  CS How does the comparison work?  CMN If you have 15 things, img have useful alternative? etc. then say 508   conformace you need these 3 tests, for wcag you have 2,3,7,9 out of a   million. designed to allowo ther tests to be allowed.  CS MAchine readable version of WCAG is out of scope or not? that's what i'm   trying to determine.  JT It's not a testing tool, it's a method for tools to talk to each other.  LK As far as our charter is concerned we have a general clause, "helping   development".. My personal opinion is that without formalizing it, using an   existing method with rdf. don't want to invent something new.  JW er will have to resolve how they want to support multiple specifications   in their system. if they think it's useful that the test output should   bemapped to a requirements of multiple specs, then they must figure out how   to implement the system. then a joint work item between wcag and ert. what   are the issues that involve both groups that need to be decided, e.g. issue   of conformance claims. Daniel put together a schema for which to make   conformance assertions. If the new language is appropriate for that role,   and provides appropriate granularity, then WCAG may adopt as base for   conformance claims.  LK At this point, judging by the discussion, people are still formulating.   I don't think we could come to a conclusion this afternoon, it is more of a   heads up. The simplest issue is to at least point into text readable   portions of it.  JW Any XHTML version including techniques would povide anchors. 2.0   techniques written as checkpoints in 1.0 version. possible to refer to any   of them from an external source.  HB The EARL has importance for potential readers for them to say, you   conform at a level that my AT can handle. Should there be a standard link   fromt he doc to the place where teh review may be, is something you may   want to consider. versioning issues: if successful with EARL, go back to   creators of docs. particular review can age. we should be able to notify   the reviewer any time the doc has been updated.  MC EARL as a language speaks to saying this thing conforms with that and   that is a URI. machine readable goes into defining what "that" is. for some   guidelines be easy, for others not easy. abstraction of guidelines from   techniques helps. can put it in the context of a specfici language. some   can not be tied down to one thing. e.g. navigation bars. how define that in   such a way that i will always find it and never not find it. what that   means for wcag is that it's an issue when thinking about the gidelines.   while not tying the guidelines donw to being too specific, need a way to   define what apply to.  MM Making a machine-readable spec, lends self to automated tool. techniques   will be non-deterministic. e.g., wherever we use the word minimize. we can   not look at a doc and determine if we have minized the use of images.  CMN versioning isrequirement for EARL, out of scope for this discussion.   already listed as reuirement. notifying reviewers is not yet in EARL. EARL   let's you point to a test. agnostic about test if it is human or manual.   mapping of how you test if you've met a requirement of wcag, is something   we have to do. we're oblighed to show hwo you conform to the spec. whether   we do that by writing up each technique with a test case or if we do it   afterwards and how is something we have t do. if we make those available,   people reuse known tests. not a wcag issue.  JW Can we brin gthis discussion to a few specific points.  ?       WCAG should decide that it will consider EARL as a possible basis   for conformance claims  ?       WCAG should affirm that designing 2.0 techniques, it will ensure   that each technique and approach to testing are identified with specificity   so that EARL can refer to.  we need to confine ourselves to how we will carry this forward.  /* vote */  JW Only members of WCAG allowed to vote on this.  WCAG Will consider EARL as basis for conformance. Places this on the open   issues lsit. favor 11, against none. Resolved.  WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each requirement can be   referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test results to be   associated with it.  CS clarification - we won't use words likeminimize or make them atomic enough?  CMN test has a URI  KHS We'd have to work hard to not do it.  /* vote on JW's point 2 */  Resolved: WCAG undertakes in defining techniques, ensure that each   requirement can be referred to w/sufficient specificity to enable test   results to be associated with it.  LK question of machine readable rules. don't think we can decide it now.  MM w/out resolving normative vs. informative, end up with orphan   checkpoints. EARL and related testing tools won't be able to test for.  CMN Resolving normative vs informative is work of group in explaining what   it means to conform to.  LK I think there is a misconception. Inability to automate does not put it   outside scope of EARL. It can record results of human judgement. e.g. clear   and simplelanguage.  MM: QA dept. won't be able to determine "minimize". There will be orphan   requirements that beg the answer "well...ok...sure". Not a fully formed   compliance with subjective tests.  WC: There will always be subjective tests. As long as manual steps are   clear, no problem. Claims will always be subjective. If assertion is   machine readable, easier to communicate your case.  CS: "Minimize" is defined at the beginning by designers not athe end by   testers.Assertion made following design.  JW: Proposes to move to the next agenda item.  CMN: Still valuable to thrash this out.  PJ: Wants to talk about necessary and sufficient conditions for techniques.  CW: We whould continue discussion.  /* vote - defeated, discussion will continue */  KB: Agrees with JW.  CMN: EARL doesn't care about wording of tests. It does allow different   results for same test. Primary use is not legal, its so stuff will work. It   builds up a body of previous test judgements.  Josh: EARL expresses too much. WCAG techniques need to be more clear about   what repairs are.  MM: There are design principles that use "avoid" or "minimize".  LK: Subjective cps or techs are totally irrelevant to EARL.  MC: Lots of challenges for EARL to handle conformance for WCAG.  Katie: If terms need to be defined consistently, its something for the   glossary. Implementation model for setting up an accessible site.  WC: Passed to EO.  WC: Would like higher conformance granularity.  CMN: Implications for AU and ER not EARL. Let's move on.  JW: Yes, let's move on and leave aside WCAG issues.  JT 4 issues here: conformance statements, operationalizing requirements,   evaluation, EARL language. Not just about WCAG relates to all.  RN Plant a seed: spec needs to read more like a requirement. requirement   rather than words.  KHS important in 508 stuff to appreciate good faith efforts.    EARL and aU  JT Issues are teh same.  CMN Yes, discussion would be teh same except substitute ATAG for WCAG.  LK As far as applying EARL to specify if an au passes ATAG, but one purpose   of EARL is an info feed into authoring tool. Do you need to take that into   account when write spec? bolted on later?  CMN implementing EARL is a useful technique for bunch of AU stuff. not an   issue but an action on AU WG.  HB Also action on EO. usability and accessibility are foreign to most all   of the books that address web authoring.  LK If i create a EARL report, there is a issue that AU wouild import an   EARL report. specific scenario: dreamweaver. should it be seriously   considered? if so, back of mind with other ATAG requirements.  JT How is EARL used to express ATAG conformance and how it is used to   repair doc.  RN If stored where could be referenced locally, great. Agree with Harvey,   right. We need to state proper terminology.  CMN EARL is considered. Does not give rise to other requirements or issues.   implementation issue.  JR Not sure how EARL is stored, a file or info w/in a doc?  LK That's implementation detail. Info is there, linked with the doc. Like   CSS - in head or linked.  CMN ditto.in ATAG techs, havce to figure it out.  JR One reason this comes up, originally it was so wouldn't have to do   manual checks over and over again.  CS if becomes requirement that extra XML included in doc, likelyu not used.  JR could be stripped out b4 published.  CMN maintain stuff or toss, depends on tool or the stuff.  MRK are mechanisms like annotations. have RDF servers.  LK propose: there be an issue added to AU issue list: add requirement that   tools import EARL. note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear   that EARL has firmed up.  Resolved: add to AU issue list: add requirement that tools import EARL.   note that you can't reasonably decide until you hear that EARL has firmed up.  HB Server should deliver EARL evals to requesting client so that they can   deliver appropriately to what the user's capabilities are.  CMN UA check EARL statemetn about a page.

Issue: implications on EARL as to how to express for UA.  /* break */  /* donovan minuting */    /* wendy's personal notes */  priorities - inherit - govnt policies are saying Level A of WCAG, and not   necessarily of WCAG 1.0. Requirements - general to HTML - people need to   test for each language. end up with 1.1.1-1.1.15 for HMTL, 1.1.16-1.1.26   for SMIL, 1.1.27-1.1.37 for SVG, etc.  broken up by technologies, but we also have our core techniques which are   cross-technology.  top level also for policy makers and managers.

WC then shadow our working drafts.  CMN Give us warning for last call.  JW I've seen W3C specs taht say "editors and working group believe next   draft would be  last call." this good idea.

CMN bunch of AU people aren't here. this has been really useful.   particularly where we have a joint meeting, then have individual groups to   have meeting but can run next door to get clarification.  WC At October, WCAG proposed going to PR in November of this year and doing   that in Australia.  JB Poll yesterday "wantto do this again?" "6 months?" 38 yeses. "12   months?" 38 yeses. so another opportunity between 6 months and 1 year.

CS flying where have 18 hour flight, 8 hours of meeting, 18 hour flight is   impractical.  JW Europe easier?  CS For me europe and australia are somewhat similar. (in terms of travel).  Helle More serious talk about going to europe. we have very few people from   europe here. particularly, where we have smaller companies who are not part   of the w3c work but interested in accessibility or required to consider   them. will help outreach. must do more in europe.  KB Agree with europe idea. We were bought by a european company. Brussels   would be good.  JB The WAI has an explicit obligation this year and next to hold a certain   number of meetings. We've complied with, since the metings in brisotl   however the intent is for outreach and recruitment. there are fascinating   things in europe, due to the commitment on the european union level. an   initiative w/in each country. everyone is doing it differently. a WAI most   of week in europe would be great.

        Is the primary goal to make visualizations accessible or to provide access   to data? If to provide access to data (which usually ends up presented in a   visualization), I propose, "Making Large Data Sets Accessible for Persons   with Disabilities."    It still feels a little awkward, but "visualization" used out of context   (i.e., just in a title) is likely to be misinterpreted  (e.g.,  PFWG is   working on  "visual verification."  When I told someone our next topic is   "visualizations" she thought we were doing "visual verification.")    --wendy    At 01:21 PM 10/8/2003, Marja-Riitta Koivunen wrote:    >I prefer the title  >Making Visualization Technologies Accessible for Persons with Disabilities  >  >but maybe we should change "Visualization Technologies" to just   >"Visualizations"?

      I'm working on my action item from last week: what should we incorporate   from the SMIL access note into a SMIL module for the techniques document.    The SMIL access note is very well written.  I compared it to the SMIL 1.0   spec.  The spec describes accessibility all over the place.  I like that   the SMIL note brings it into one place and creates a context for accessibility.    But, what are authors really going to use?  I think they will use the   tutorials that are pointed to from the SMIL page.  The two that I looked at   do not mention accessibility.  They don't even use the word "caption" and   leave out the system-caption attribute where they mention the other system   attributes.    yikes.    The authoring tools working group is working with companies to incorporate   accessibility into existing tools.  The user agent working group is working   with companies to incorporate accessibility into existing user agents.    perhaps our job is to work with documentation developers to incorporate   accessibility into existing documentation?    look at the effort it takes, not only for us but for authors, to create our   own documentation:  1. we have to learn about, write, test and maintain the techniques in our   own documents.  2. we have to raise awareness that the documents exist.  3. authors have to learn from one source what to do, then *unlearn* many of   those things when they come to our stuff.  4. our stuff is a separate thing.  it requires an author to read more than   one document.  is that likely to happen?    The Guidelines need to exist because AU and UA point to them.  They   establish a good baseline that techniques, from a variety of sources, can   point to. It is a great work (that still needs some polishing).  But I'm   wondering if instead of putting our effort into creating all these new   techniques modules, perhaps we would get more bang for the buck if we   worked with existing documents to incorporate accessibility.    Then our techniques document would be lists of pointers to examples,   tutorials, and other documents whose authors we have worked with to include   accessibility.    thoughts?  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello all,    As I mentioned a few weeks ago at a teleconference, I've been looking for a   graphic designer to help us illustrate the working draft of WCAG 2.0.  I   began discussing possibilities with one person last week, Meg.    She put together a page that shows icons and screen shots she has designed   for other clients.  This gives an idea of her style.  It is at:   http://www.digitalmeg.com/wcag/    I was thinking she could create icons for each checkpoint and guideline to   help illustrate the concepts.  If someone clicked on the icon they would   get a larger image of it, more detailed.  I sent her Anne's work, but we   haven't had a chance to discuss it yet.    I'll be talking with her again this week, any questions you would like me   to ask her?    My proposal:  I'll ask her to illustrate checkpoint 1.1 to see what she comes up   with.  We can then talk about it.    Thoughts?  --w  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

      Our next chat will be held Monday, 10 December 2001 at the regularly   scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (15:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what   time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place only in IRC (i.e. no bridge) at:  irc server: irc.w3.org  port: 6665  channel: #er    Agenda for Monday:  - Continue discussion about threads in EARL as a possible solution to the   state issue.  I tried to summarize the issues and a few things to consider at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/12/05-minutes.html#summaries    Towards the end of the discussion, Jim and Sean were talking about   threading between multiple test subjects instead of trying to represent   state info in EARL.    - Jim asked to add "querying earl" to the agenda    - We still need to discuss combining EARL reports    -  Please let me know if you are unfamiliar with IRC, have trouble typing   or try to limit your typing due to injuries or other reasons, or have any   other concerns with IRC-only meetings.  It seems to be an effective method   for this group, but I want to ensure that everyone is comfortable with it.    Are there other topics people would like to nominate for the   agenda?  Please send suggestions to the list.

      We discussed the face-to-face on the call today.    Here is a summary of where we are at in 4 points:    1. After CSUN is out because other WAI working groups have made plans.    2. After WWW9 is out because of the W3C AC meeting.    3. Before WWW9 is possible.  However, it is more likely to happen in   Sophia, France than in Amsterdam, Netherlands due to administrative   logistics.  A quick search of one-way tickets from Nice to Amsterdam shows   the following two options:    Option1  Price: 1 adult @ USD 159.30  Transavia Airlines flight 6584 on a Boeing 737-300    From: Nice, France (NCE) Friday, May 12 9:55pm    Option 2  Price:1 adult @ USD 159.30  Transavia Airlines flight 6582 on a Boeing 737-300    From: Nice, France (NCE) Saturday, May 13 9:45am    I didn't investigate the added cost of a one-way ticket to Nice, then to   Amsterdam then Amsterdam back to a city in the U.S., Canada, or other   country.  It might be cheaper to fly into Amsterdam, then down to Nice and   back...? I also did not find out what a train would cost.    I also need to confirm with W3C folks that before www9 in Amseterdam is   *definitely* out.    4. Len offered that it would be easy to get a meeting room at Temple   University in Philadelphia, PA.  What about a time in April?  Personally, I   am only available April 1 - 19, but think this could work well if people   are able to travel in April. Although, as William pointed out that means   that some people may be traveling March to CSUN, April to an ER meeting,   then May for WWW9.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      15 January - 21 January 2002  from: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-announce/2002JanMar/0001.html    CSS Selectors Test Suite Announced       17 January 2002: The CSS Working Group is pleased to announce the     first release of the "CSS Selectors Test Suite" written by Daniel     Glazman (Netscape/AOL), Ian Hickson, and Tantek ?elik (Microsoft)     for "Selectors" and the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language Levels     2 and 3. Ian Hickson developed variants for all kinds of XML and HTML     in a format invented by Tantek ?elik. The original CSS1 Test Suite     has been converted to the new format. 'object' elements allow the same     tests to be used in different test suites. The Working Group welcomes     comments.

      Hello,    The W3C management has been discussing a W3C All Activity Meeting.  Here is   an excerpt from Janet Daly's message to the chairs sent 8 September 2000 [1].    <blockquote>  In summary, the proposal is for a three-day, all-activity meeting to which   all W3C groups (Working/Interest/Coordination) would be invited. We plan to   have  1.  meeting rooms available for face-to-face meetings  2.  plenary sessions open to all attendees  3.  space available for groups to meet each other, and exchange ideas  </blockquote>    The current timeframe under consideration is the last week of Februrary.    1. Would you be interested in attending a three-day multigroup/all activity   meeting?  Would you want to piggyback a WG face to face meeting on one day   either side of the multigroup/all activity meeting?    2. What content/structure would make this more appealing to you? What   format would you prefer?    3. Which working groups or interest groups should we try to coordinate some   meeting time with?  Particularly, are there groups outside of the WAI   domain that you would like to see us discuss particular issues with?    4. Are you available the last week of February?    Thank you for your comments,  --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2000JulSep/0102.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      A recent webreview.com survey (11 February 2000   http://webreview.com/pub/2000/02/11/poll//results.html) asked the following   question:  "The W3C has established accessibility standards (WAI) to help   people with disabilities access information on the Web. Are you paying   attention to those standards on your site?"    The results:  44% of respondents replied "Yes, we are trying to follow those standards   the best we can."  55% replied "No, we haven't looked into the accessibility standards."    wow.  better than i thought.  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    I have posted the minutes from today's call:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000214.html    I have also updated the home page to link to the minutes from last week's   meeting (which we realized that I had forgotten to do - oops), as well as   the minutes from today's.    As always, please send me corrections and omissions.    Note the long list of action items, excerpted here for your enjoyment <grin>:    LK take title questions for ERT and existing tools document to list for   discussion.    WC find what WCAG says re: text equivalents for audio - need extra file or   not? pretty sure a recent discussion, if so post to ER. if not, send to WCAG.    MC propose wording for change to ERT to check for audio on SCRIPT, EMBED,   APPLET, and OBJECT elements.    LK go through document, pick out sections where a header probe would apply.   Propose a blurb to put in each one.    GR see which techniques this applies to and propose wording for change to ERT.    WC edit ERT to make it clear that if client-side map and server-side   provided then don't need to invoke the "don't use server-side map" check.    MC dig up something about identifying tracks in quicktime.    WC dig up info on tracks in SMIL.    WC look into Flash to determine if can identify various tracks.    WC update ERT to reflect resolution: basic check is to ask the author, when   feasible check programmatically.    Plus, there are still a few open from last week:  LK send note today to EO to ask hold off on review of ERT until we send   them the "all clear."  WC once publish next draft (that takes into account the clean up of review   from Michael's and Len's comments), send EO note to let them know a stable   draft is available.  WC include the NBA wording in the technique about longdesc.  LK take quesiton to WCAG wg - "alt or text content of applet. if text in   applet, also need 'alt'"  (WC incorporate into ERT) Resolved:("valid londesc") it is desirable for   the tool to follow links, whether interal or external, recursively apply   guidelines to whatever depth the author wants. Longdesc is automatic.    thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        I disagree with "The title element: 2.4.1.x ? need to create a success   criterion"  Guideline 4.1 says, "use technologies according to spec."  "title" is a   required element in HTML 4.01 [1], thus html:title must be used and is   covered by success criterion/guideline 4.1.

      In Len's comments from the 23rd of January [1]  about the 21 December draft   [2] he asked that the WCAG definition for a linearized table be included in   checkpoint 5.3.  There was some other clean-up to do as well.    I propose:  <blockquote>  Checkpoint 5.3 - Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense   when linearized  Technique 5.3.1 [priority 2] Verify that  layout tables make sense when   linearized    Discussion Status:  under discussion    Evaluation:  A TABLE element will trigger this evaluation.  This technique applies only to tables used for layout purposes, not to data   tables.    Example of a message to be displayed:  Tables used for layout should make sense when linearized.  When a table is 'linearized,' the cells are read in the order in which they   appear in the HTML source.    Repair Technique:  Linearize the table and ask the author to verify that the result is   understandable.    Test Files and Discussion Files:  Link to test file for this technique.  </blockquote>    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Jan/0059.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-19991221.html      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello all,    The minutes from today are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/19991220.html    as always, let me know of corrections and additions.    Summary of resolutions and action items    Resolved: no need to check a table for multiple levels of row/column   headers unless the table has greater than 3 rows or columns  Resolved: TH elements should have an ABBR attribute if the header name is   greater than 15 characters. ABBR attribute values should be less than 15   characters.  WC send proposal to list for wording of prompt for author to help determine   if table is layout or for data.  GR show how some simple tables look like linearized.  CR write a proposal for a prompt for the author for 5.3.  WC proposal to incorporate null alt-text  CR start discussion on horizontal rule and ascii art.  WC dig up GL discussions about 5.2 and how author would identify.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Len's original requirements (i.e. expectations) at  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Nov/0018.html  dd: is it also used for accessibility of language (e.g. smil) ?  <Geeze> Not so much a formal "language" as a collection of tools/methods   for expressing assertions/evaluations concerning accessibility and   conformance to guidelines therefor.  <Geeze> Should be a requisite part of *ALL* Web documents!  <Sean> And hence enabling us to point and repair according to those expressions  tim: record who did it, what it says, both used as input/output  dave: is the output a rating ?  tim: not just that  <Geeze> "AN" output is a rating. There is no "THE" output.  <Sean> In general we want to create a rich metadata description language   that can describe the accessibility of languages, and also point into these   languages specifically if possible. This should also enable the repairing   of the documents  <Sean> People should be able to make accessibility assertions about their   documents, and accessibility tools authors should be able to utilize ADL   for pointing out accessibility errors and repairing them.  <dd> bill: why not a formal language ?  <Geeze> too restrictive and huge of an undertaking - leads to enmirement in   details rather than obtaining results.  <Geeze> insufficiently diverse.  <dd> we're now looking at charles' RDF page http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/  <Geeze> A collection of such items rather than a formal language is what I   covet.  <dd> but it used rdf, so it is formal ?  <Sean> Note how it compares with myself/Mr. Loughborough's example at:   http://xhtml.waptechinfo.com/subadl/  <Geeze> but it's not "ADL" nor is it itself a language but just use of   existing languages/techniques - already in place.  <Sean> RDF provides a framework that can allow us to create vocabularies  <Sean> How we define and use those vocabularies is the important part  <dd> agree  <Geeze> If we focus on creating a "language" instead of using its precepts   to utilize existing mechanisms we are viewing the "hole" rather than the   "donut".  tim: ability to produce human readable report (using XSLT e.g.)  <Geeze> right on!  <Sean> That's one of many requirements and possibilities  <dd> we're now looking at the requirement section in Sean's  ADL summary http://www.mysterylights.com/xhtml/adl/  <Sean> http://www.mysterylights.com/xhtml/adl/#p31  <Geeze> decentralization and diversification are inevitable/central to   success. More than one way to skin this cat.  <Sean> Look at 3.2 - it's more generic:   http://www.mysterylights.com/xhtml/adl/#p32  susan; how use in authoring environment? important not to look at pages but   entire sites. also, sites that are dynamically generated. what does that   mean in terms of inserting code?  <Sean> ADL could be dynamically generated along with pages  <Geeze> E.g., Bobby/WAVE/A-prompt and many others do similar things in   somewhat different ways. This diversity will be  inevitable/important.  <Sean> ADL could/should be an integral part of a well designed site  cmn: pull pieces together dynamically and make sure alternatives exist for   those pieces. address contents of database plus template that's used to   pull stuff together.  <Sean> Pull what stuff together? Be specific  <Geeze> client side proxy is !important last in "cascade".  LK: fixed content page look at template.  dd: how do communicate to human that human judgement is required? in a way   that they can relate to it.  susan: there are people that don't know anything about accessibility or   HTML (or other langs)  <Sean> Too many!  susan: to be as widely implemented as possible, needs to be understandable   by wide audience.  <Sean> It should be automatic  davep: implement circularly behind the scenes.  <Geeze> They've opted to participate by using a "participating" authoring   tool that has involved them in making human judgements which is flattering.  <Sean> If editing tools had ADL type systems built in, and required   metadata etc...  cmn: assume test suite. i went w/rdf since can associate w/that suite   rather than official version.  <Sean> Like the UWIMP system, we aim to just have people type in stuff   about their site, and out pops a profile  <dd> what's UWIMP?  <Sean> I'll let Mr. Loughborough field that one!  <Geeze> Universal Web Index Management Program  <dd> URI?  <Sean> Not yet. http://uwimp.com/ under construction  <Geeze> http://uwimp.com but it won't be up for about three days. Just   bought the domain name!  susan: re: cmn proposal: say that someone has a long pg, they get back 100   errors, how will the lang help a tool help them decide importance.  <Sean> Based on WCAG levels, I suppose...  cmn: does not prioritize. if you want to, do that on implementation. e.g.   may have a tool that only describes images. can say, this is what i can   help you do.  <Sean> If there were more levels: A1/A2/A3/A4/A5/A6, it would be easier to   assign priorities to accessibility.  cmn: another tool might pick p1's out of WCAG.  <Geeze> User choice as to how usable/accessible a site should be.  cmn: depends on tool implementing and talking w/author.  <Sean> Yes.  jg: how many people use templates from AT vs. use own.  susan: customize templates.  <Sean> If people hear about accessibility, then they should be able to look   it up and see that they can use our tools, the W3Cs tools.  jg g: "using for data?" "using for layout?" what about tool telling   problems while designing template.  <Geeze> "templates" from AT are actually widely exchanged sort of like   music mp3 files. Show me yours, I'll show you mine, etc.  susan: first, if they are a pro designer iterative design. usually have a   design that they have to repair. re: AT (dreamweaver) we don't interfere   w/the design process. we could design something that lays on top of that.   to do that in the authoring environment that would be inappropriate.  <Sean> Most templates aren't even valid XHTML. Even Amaya!!!  <Geeze> E.g. use a little program that makes image map design easier   "within" one's authoring environment.  cmn: take the 1st image in your doc if you turn it off, still able to use   the pg.  sharon: checklist need to go through.  LK two methods: 1 batch mode other do creative process.  JG not to interfere w/creativity, some techs more access than others. if   waiting for post-design comments, they will complain. "if i used this diff   tech when i started out would be ok and not have to redesign.  ag want to capture MVC, model capture it all. give user filtered summary   should be the "view" they reviewing results.  ag; benefits of formality:  1. can use evaluation from one author, repair from another. Interoperability.  2. drive view constructions.  sharon: i agree w/al. i want to add: interactivity during repair is important.  1. as susan said, part of design is interaction.  2. management of repair process. able to talk about progress.  <Sean> Mainly a) Asserts accessibility, b) Makes assumptions about   accessibility, c) Makes repairs as far as I'm concerned  <wendy> are these requirements sean?  <Sean> Yes. They are the core requirements.  daniel: sean why is making repair a requirement?  <Sean> To make assertions about site and page accessibility is the main one  <Geeze> caveat that "makes repairs" is under user control.  <wendy> how is making the repair in adl a requirement?  <Sean> That is a strongly advised option  <Sean> If you make assertions about accessibility, why not repair based on   those assertions?  dd: understand, not sure agree. should it include process assertions? when   in fact a format?  tim: input into a repair tool.  <Geeze> ATAG revisited - the timing/extent of "repairs" must be   author-controlled to be usable.  <Sean> Otherwise, what else would we use ADL for. Except to say this page   is WCAG 1.0 AA  dd: can say where eval comes from. manual, auto, etc. name the credentials.  cmn An ADL description identifies 5 errors. Use a repair tool to fix two of   them And generate some more aDL that says they're fixed  <Geeze> just pointing stuff out is instructional and that's a main goal -   training in methodology. (optimized: change the existing ADL to acknowledge   the changed status)  <Sean> What exactly is ADL for? It's an accessibility description language,   by definition. O.K., so what are we using it for?  dave: bldg on charles idea of modularity. potentially end up w/100's of   reported bad points in code.  <Sean> To assert accessibility, and then allow repairs based on that!?  dp: if prioritize, then can show only important ones. requires matrix of   relative importance needed.  <Sean> That can easily be built in.  dp: if 155 errors are all equal, won't do any.  <Geeze> hence a "user template" of what to report/repair/ignore.  dp: particularly needed if modularized.  <Sean> Just say "you did this error 155 times"  <Sean> That could be a user template option  dp: misinterpreted not same error 155 x's, but 155 errors.  <Geeze> there's no jail term for ignoring or brownie points for following   the pointers to "errors".  dp: where to start.  <Geeze> we've started.  <Sean> So what if we get a list of 155 errors. If we can automatically   repair them all, it does't matter.  cmn: 1. agree that in an implementation, good to prioritize.  <Geeze> in fact Josh Krieger started it with Bobby .1  cmn: another model: hot dog. it has access checking. they have a structure   view of doc. that id's errors.  <Geeze> so will Flash.  cmn: always available. use it as go. if you add 500 imgs to a site.  <Sean> Yes. WCAG need to say exactly how important each checkpoint is. Some   checkpoints are more/less important to some people than others. There is no   fixed table. We have to allow the user to make some sense of it: the user   of ADL that is...  cmn: you might add 500 IMG elements, then assign images or do each as go.  <wendy> wc: (just to irc) we have priorities in wcag.  <Sean> We need more layers  cmn : important that design decisions be made when being implemented.   author can say, "don't hassle me" or" help me as I go":  <Geeze> IMO those "layers" might be user-defined rather than by some   "central authority"  tim: if incorporate priority into ADL.  <Sean> Some people may say that with 500 images, I'm not going to be able   to write 500 longdescs, so they choose to ignore that. William is right.  tim: can point to external resource. as author of tool can say, for   "webman" we'll prioritize that way. bob, will have a diff priority. if we   have 10 standard tests, we can point to wcag, or our description.  <wendy> sean - ok. any comments b4 you go?  <Sean> I have one main comment  sharon: separate description of accessibility from user interface.  harvey: images might have multiple uses.  <Sean> ADL should be a tool that people can add to their sites to enable   automated tools and humans alike to see how accessible that site is. They   should then also be able repair to their needs so that they can access the   site how *they* (the user) needs it. That is a lot of scope, but it is   definitely needed.  harvey: if description attached to image, fix it once then all places point   to it should be able to tell has been fixed.  <Sean> I'll be back later, thanks.  susan: people get back huge reports, the majority of stuff they should look   at not in reports. b/c we couldn't evaluate the code. it is difficult to   decide what to look at. even just priority 1 checkpoints. can be   overwhelming. hard to give feedback as to what to focus on.  <Geeze> sounds like a "retrofit" viewpoint. Must focus on authoring tool   reminders  al: geeze made good point: alerting on the fly is a user option. ATAG   discussed this. has addressed. what do you tell the designer first? when   have many errors. my ideal: have demographics. not only that violated rule   A, but that there is a pattern.  <Geeze> the journey of 1000 errors begins with one mistake  al: 67% of violations of checkpoint 3 look like this. therefore, something   in reporting function. other errors spread over variety of patterns. we   don't have that knowledge base. design description lang so tool can use   that along w/data w/what finds.  <Geeze> I think we DO have a form of that "knowledge base" via WebWatch and   resources like it.  <wendy> (just on irc) of errors made via WCAG?  LK if we want to tell person the priorities, doesn't have to be in aDL   file. that say the errors, separate source tells how to categorize and   prioritize. e.g. 508 might have their own. that pointed to by tool.  <Geeze> I used to hate spell-check notification, learned to love it. same   could happen with ATAG conformant tools.  dave p: another complexity: if I minimize author workload, but they say, "i   have a graphical site, bump up priority of a particular group."  dave P: therefore weight tests based on audience needs. W3C more equal   weightings.  CMN that's len's example. 508 vs. WCAG.  <Geeze> "audience needs" and one's own most frequent transgressions.  LK this is additional.  tim: thought about a lot. trick is attribution chunk of ADL to attribute   chunks to people. if I attribute that SSB conforms and point to 508. access   board points back to my doc and says valid relative to 508.  daveP: ref from rather than w/in.  cmn: statement of what tests use is not integral to test results.  tim: questions about # of tests. important to have commonalities between   errors. would like to see each one flagged as individual violation. esp. as   input into repair too. also, supports need for summary stats in ADL output.  <Geeze> "individual flags" would be *your* option but not mandatory for all.  [10:45] break.  LK: people having interesting discussions during break. share points from   break?  daniel: my feeling is that we should decide if ADL (EDL) is raw data.   anything inferred should not be there. should be in diff file or processed   elsewhere. the eval format should just have result of eval. we need to   discuss what data model is used. len and i drew a simple rdf graph where   have a resource that has a statement about it. both description of error   and the method used to eval. i.e. rdf triplet. URI, problem, method ,   author of description start w/simple data model then map to rdf. don't need   to put in ADL that it is "A" or AA, can be inferred. if this file has 3000   image missing alt, don't put in file, infer.  <Geeze> not just "errors" but also pointers to conformances?  dave P: clarification: you are describing ADL as output of checking   process. my thought was ADL was what does the process.  DD: ADL Is the lang.  daveP; the lang of the report?  DD YES storing rawa data of eval. e.g. want outp ut of HTML validator to be   aDL. today it is just a human report then EDL - evaluation description lang.  LK shall we try to get consensus? should we create a lang that includes   other types of validation?  <Geeze> and other items than "validations"  sharon: clarification: meta info about a product, e.g. B. Schneiderman this   site works best with software X. does raw data include meta info about   accessibility, what user tests were done, etc.  DD: could be. same type of statement. have URI, say something about it.   could say, "it's not usable." using usability method Y. see diff level of   rdf and schema. have overall schema that describe the statement,. the   descrip point to another schema, e.g. for WCAG or whether used human   testing, or heuristic, or ...  <Geeze> hb Jove, I think you've got it.  DD for HTML validation have only one method. using parser Z  sharon: this is a small step in that direction. this beyond what discuss   this a.m.  <Geeze> Giant step!  davep: scope?  dd: boundaries are: designing a lang that assesses...  dd:reports  sharon:describes  dd: list of assertions of fragments  LK continue going around the table  sean (on the phone now): making a framework to eval docs not just   accessibility. accessibility one use?  dd yes  sean: beyond WAI?  DD yes we are in need in W3C to formalize conformance. e.g. test suite to   test SMIL conformance. could generate EDL from test suite.  <Geeze> Hoo Ray!  DD the framework is simple.  <Geeze> WAI will wag the W3C dog in this matter.  DD work detail of accessibility specifics out later.  sean: sounds good.  susan: i talked w/dave during the break. about priority wcag checkpoints   that we could not test for. e.g. p1, shift in natural lang.  mike: cmn and I discussed flash  <Geeze> the author can "test for" that.  mike: what we're working on in future.  dd: i also discussed w/mike at break. flash objects can have unique id.  <Geeze> and longdescs?  mike: pointing into flash files is something working on. want to make files   searchable. like xpath.  mike: not be a longdesc. right now, no. you can assign a flash object w/in   anything in HTMl doc.  cmn: this HTML fragment is a description for this flash object.  dd external file?  mike: yes.  cmn: right it in rdf.  tiM: affects of jetlag.  al; pass  harveY pass  jon: higher level concept: this based on design decision. creating this   affect (e.g. menu) has a variety of accessibility problems. if diff tech   used, could get rid of problems. say this group of things a problem?  <Geeze> tools to aid in habituating indexing.  <wendy> ?  jg: say i have 30 images in a composite images. w/mouseovers. images have   text. if had used something else to make site map. access issues may have   gone away. could simplify site. if known what author doing (site map) then   the group (this feature) could be classified.  dd: summarizes.  jg: rather than saying 100 problems, say there are just these 2.  dd that is compatible.  <Geeze> If ADL-enabled tool is in use it will train the author in   indexing/outlining/clarifying the generated materials.  dd description of real problem, but also the bigger problem. carry raw data   (specific problem) as well as higher-level.  susan: do you mean things like disjointed rollovers? there is info embedded   in jscript?  jg: i can give a demo. at lunch. at design time, questions have to be asked   about what the author is trying to do. after they've created it (getting   gifs in right places) then say "you could have done it this way" they won't   want to hear it. could have saved time.  sharon: this sound like user interface design vs testing. perhaps tools   (category analysis - do upfront). don't go to user testing until get basic   testing out of way.  <Geeze> "user interface PLUS testing"?  sharon: in design phase, do some testing rather than testing phase (for   usability). part of engineering process.  dave: scope, user impact. scope: w/shift to output (say bobby), i have the   image that adl is the app. if emphasis on output have scoping problem   w/prioritization & test integration. 2. from what we're hearing from users,   i want to produce accessible content. but how? i don't care if it is a   checkpoitn, i accept yoru authority it is wrong. i want to be told how to   fix it. straight from report to suggestion. if really curious, explain why.   (effect on users)  cmn: 1. tim&i - we start of mtg talking diff langs. 2. dd suggestion of   separting eval lang that we plug pieces into., supports dave's point. the   tool can point you to where you have configured, e.g. specific schema   example or animated process. 3. checking for changes in nat. lang and many   others are implemented. one reason to keep the model open is we need to   account for that. tools are good and bad at different thigns. 4. take this   model, obvious schema to use would be AERT. this now w/in AU. note   dependency. 5. tim&i - implementing rdf in WART. (it's a form of yes/no   questions).  ag: server that generates report tool from user.  wc web accessibility report tool (WART)  cmn: SSB uses XML schema to carry eval info. cool to see how plug together.   6. canonicalization of non-xml. deal w/javascritp, css,etc. essentially   declare algorithm. bad html another. tidy e.g. that makes that conversion.   7. re: jon's point: you can infer that tool X did or didn't do this. at   implementation level, e.g. dreamweaver has clean up word generated HTML.'   it expects what word generates. anothere.g., know of good images w/rdf. can   expect rdf.  <Geeze> hence the "how" part of the indexing.  cmn 8. requirement: to add human readable comment. or assertion about a doc.  <Geeze> hence "proselevel"  wendy: pass  len: sketching on board what info attachand where. [sorry, william no way   to transmit to you.] e.g. defn of priorities. defn of compliance. defn of   repair.  LK talking about a process that will combine all the info to make a report   or part of an editor. if we go w/that model. then can talk about the   variety fo files. then suggestions about what some processors might do. re:   concern about interactive rather than once finished, the raw issues list   could be updated every time you completed or added another object. person   always look there. check for alerts. this framework should cover people's   concerns.  jg: can this be used tos ay, "this is a good way to do this."? can i use   this to search the web to find out good exampes.  dd yes positive assertsion. right, don't want to call it an "error" it's a   statement about a way of doing something.  jg: if building functionality. collection of 20 or 30 elements i can look   for that.  hb: more than pointing to techniques docx.  <Geeze> real Web examples *become* the "techniques document".  al: chief thing that i hear william saying: we need to promote   documentation of web base and quickly!  alg: now for myself: this is a tech. assessment at what you have of w3c   recommendations. this output is the result of applying some method to some   fragment. you have data of output. this data is the result of applying   criteria to something. this is what rdf does. what rdf doesn't is what dave   asked for. defn. of primitive tests. the pattern that defines a checkpoint   is outside capability of rdf. tomorrow i will talk about pf interface   w/query group. nothing in w3c recommendations that is the normal form for   writing these. go ahead in prolog or whatever we need to write the   low-level traps. all can do in rdf tod ay is refer to test by name. we'll   create namespace for names of test.  <Geeze> but "the pattern that defines a checkpoint" is not outside the   capability of the author, who can make an assertion in good faith.  alg: the point is: the database that we build should accept self-evaluation   assertsions from author.  DP can come from anywhere.  dd: give an example rdf can't do but query can.  al: doesn't have logical variable. has to refer to concrete instance.  DP; schematron does what rdf doesn't.  cmn: can't make an inference.  <Geeze> author can make an inference.  cmn: you can say "man is moral" "socrates is man" but can't infer "socrates   is moral"  al: my vision has to do w/subprogram call interface and notion of foraml   variable. in calling prog. this is like "x" in forall(x). in logic   languges. can't hypothesize entities, only concrete. tim's briefing of   architecture of semantic web. but that info is member private.  dd: question of scope. rep hueristics? or rep adl? that's dave's question.   on that boundary diff in technology base. if app of rdf, then recognise   larger scope. no w3c precedent to say how to do  len: can say this img doesn't have alt-text. can take those 2 statements   and infer a violation.  al: believe yes.  len: use RDF for everyting, but have own custome engine to bring things   together. a custom logic engine.  al: wouldn't say "custom" but tool that performs logic must understand both   rdf and what we add. simply understanding rdf doesn't provide everything.  dd: tools like WAVe have intelligence in the tool.  <Geeze> a multiplicity of such tools wouldn't do us any harm!  dd: we need something stronger than rdf so WAVE can generate ADL. consensus   of scope? is scope the format or the logic process?  dave (has also drawn some circles & lines on the board) app makes ADL   output. both machine and human processable. doesn't deal with formatting or   to scope the priority engine. which should integrate standards, other   prefs, and user prefs. priority engine takes as input: standards, user   prefs, and other prefs. the app takes priorities from that engine as well   as tests. plus a document. the app outputs report (adl) and report (human).   the adl is input into repair tool.  tim: we want to codify inputs into testing tools.  <Geeze> sounds a bit like Sean's app?  dave: that will do it.  tim:that's impossible. not a bad idea, but issue of trust that not   inserting into system. i have 10's of 1,000's of tests. we might be   interested in what my inputs are, the industry is trusting me to make that   for them. as ref. for output, it is enough for you to ref me. it's like   certificate authority. i say this is accessible then responsible for that   claim.  lk: you're lucky. whenever i say that something is ! accessible, people say   "really a problem?" "how do you know?" i need traceability.  dp: time are you saying you deliver in standard format the results of your   tests?  tim: yes. here is how testing and these are the tolerances.  <Al> Wm: What do you mean "Sean's Ap?" He proposed a format. Is there a   processor that goes with it?  tim: if you want to do the research on this, to codify that, ...  dp: thinking much higher. not that level.  <Geeze> "traceability" is a form of centralization that mattereth not. If   the movie "gets two thumbs up" I'll buy a ticket.  tim: map to AERT 1.1.1.A, "al-text bad if have filename" and no further.   that level.  cmn: "the machine said so" good traceability.  <Geeze> Sean has a program on line that does a bit of what's being talked   about here, I'll find a URI later.  cmn: describing how online tool works.   http://www.w3.org/1999/11/11-WWWProposal/atagdemo.html  LK: get most argument from subjective which can't formalize in schema.  cmn can formalize anything.  al: depending on schema lang.  tim: scope: dependency on tests. idea of tests and subtests.  <Geeze> al: one of sean's thingies is at   http://xhtml.waptechinfo.com/xhtmltordf/  tim: a way in rdf to say levels of tests: meets checkpoint 1.1, but how.  cmn: can sum them up.  al: talking about single tree of tests. in cmn comment are 3 trees.  dd: do we have a list of URI whose granularity is good enough.  WC not yet. wrote up ideas last week  dd: need to assess goodness of doing something (methods)  cmn: granularity is test suite. for ATAG-TECHS we have draft test suite.   AERT is sort of test suite. b/c of model, could say best test suite ref is   statement of checkpoint in wcag. method is: check by hand. other cases:   automated or semi-auto tests to gather.  dp: i want my own root as well as the w3c.  <Geeze> Right on, Dave!  [12:28] > lunch  <Geeze> I have this strong image of Charles sitting in this lifeboat   labelled "RDF" as he tries to pull everyone into it from the WWW Sea.  <Geeze> One of the main characteristics of humans is their role as little   islands of negative entropy constantly creating order from chaos and that's   just what we are about here.  <Geeze> It's not just about accessibility. What ADL (EDL?) will do is be   the "electronic curbcut" that makes all this accessibility the route for   everybody to have a truly "Semantic Web"  <Geeze> All the considerations about what machines can do vs. what's   required of the author underline the other buzzword that so nicely   describes what's needed: a "Web of Trust".  [13:00] <Geeze> Al's summation of what I had in my mind was masterful -   especially the "Quickly!" part.  [13:00] <Geeze> Now is the time. This is the way.  [back from lunch]  LK Do we want to have XML applicable to any language, even if it isn't an   XML language?  HB Some of those are closed - you can't tamper without breaking  WC You can't even look at some of it  DP Restrict accepting for output formats. We don't want to present XML to   the user We don't want to output XML to humans  AG isn't the question what we can refer to?  LK Yes  LK: Wendy and people have been thinking about problems in XML that would   result in problems for the  WC We want to be able to look at the accessibility of languages, as well as   the content written in the languages  DD We would have a system that would work for anything that can be referred   to a URI. Anything outside that isn't on the Web  LK Anything can be referred to by a URI  AG It can be referred to. So talked about.  DD If there is a javascript and one instruction is a problem how do you   refer to it? count the line? Is there a reference model for anything? How   useful is that if it is not understood by others .  AG As long as it can be understood by ADl it is OK.  CMN This is the issue of a canonicalization of nonXML  DD Meaning?  CMN Meaning an agreed way of pointing into non-XML. e.g. bad HTML converted   by tidy. That's an algorithm that is defined (and implemented) So what we   mean is "the result of running this through  tidy".  LK So it applies to each language, but it is necessary to figure out a   canonical scheme to reference it  WC Think so. we need something that can make canonical references to javascript  LK Are these in the scope of this project?  WC I think it would be interesting to look at this for javascript. That   would give us an implementation. Then we have shown proof of concept.  LK We have ECMAscript, broken HTML, XML (that is trivial) Should we try to   get something on flash?  MW Not currently...  DD If you want to asses ATAG compliance what you are looking at is a   program not a language. Either you consider Frontpage as an object with an   ID, or maybe it has modules so you say "this piece of frontpage is not   compliant" generally you have two entities. The subject of the evaluation   (maybe a page, or a program, or a coke bottle) and the other piece is the   object - the reference module you are using for evaluation - AERT, ATAG   checkpoints, SSB assessment tests, ... we need to cover all those cases  LK Would we define properties that someone can say "this table lamp is UL   approved"?  CMN The properties we came up with, cover that  WC For the case of a function of an authoring tool?  CMN We4 defined a property for an Authoring tool. We3 have a partial   database of tools, and you can make assertions about a thing or collection   of those things. to use a part of a tool you need a scheme for breaking and   referencing part of the tool. We didn't do that  DP Something that has mostly ASCII - can you asses that?  CMN RDF is XML. XML uses Unicode. So you get to deal with nearly all   characters...  DP So requirement is to deal with plain text information.  WC There are things like that.  DP How to address character encodings? repair could be switch to unicode  CMN an alternative is to define an XML translation for specific plain text   document types (e.g. RFC) which have known characteristics  AG You don't want that if you want to repair them. You want to be able to   index into the broken text and be  able to repair it.  CMN The requirement to make it work for repair would be to have two-way   transformation algorithm. Mark up, address it, repair it if required,   transform back to original format.  LK Scope. Any language (in theory)?  DD Anything that is on the web. anything with a URI  WC Authoring tools may not be on the web  DD We work on the detail for accessibility in that framework  DP Do we mean programming language or natural language?  AG Natural language  DP is that a sub-type of text file?  LK There is "any language. If we build it so it can handle any language,   which ones do we actually work on?  WC An authoring tool isn't "on the web". We can specifically say "any   language, web tools, ..." Basically anything covered by WCAG ATAG UAAG  AG There are those three things  DD That's fine. The charter of WAI is to cover anything that is used to   browse / author on the web.  WC Or used to put something on the web  DD Where is a counter example  WC I think we all agree.  DD If it has a unique ID it is on the web  AG I disagree that it has to have a URI already.  DD I agree. If you consider the CSS test suite there are several tests   grouped under one URI. The padding test has 5 tests with the same URI. To   assess a user agent against it you need to create a URL for it If I want to   say that Mozilla fails CSS1-box property - test 5 I don't have a URI for   that but I will create one. I create a URI then I can use that.  LK Are we in agreement with what we want to include?  SM We had talked about dynamic generated things. THey are things you want   to evaluate. Maybe you want to restrict it to how it evaluates to the   guidelines. but there may be other examples  HB There are a large class of things that have URIs that don't have   descr4iption available. It is only somewhere else that we get a description   of them. It disturbs me hat anything with a URI is subject to our  consideration  DD What's the problem? I can evaluate them against a reference system - for   example is it a valid PNG? We have a generic framework. Both the subject   and the tests can be varied. We want to work on the accessibility   semantics, because that is our role, but leave open the possibility to use   other systems / test  TS THere is a question of what is a URI. How does a file, a hard drive, and   a URI translate? There is no value for me in having a URI. If I have a java   file and give a line number I can start there. How is a URI a necessary   framework? It makes more sense to say this is how I interact with a   pointer. SO people can go write an engine to point into CSS  WC That answers my question about an authoring tool URI Is a good way to   label web documents, but for an authoring tool we would have to make them   up - or have some other descriptor - some way to identify it. ideally   machine-readable. I think identifier is what is required. with javascript   we need a way to identify fragments.  LK Can we put aside a question of URI and see if we are agreed on the class   of things we want this to apply to first?  DP Crudest one I would like to use is a document.  WC Web Content  DD Product is another thing We should put tools into scope. Are we agreed   that we want to do tools, web content, things that a server reads (e.g. php   intermediate processing?  WC Schemas and DTDs If you look at PHP and that are we looking into   databases as  well?  DP suggest we exclude that class of beast.  TS Goes back to the functionality question. It would be super useful to be   able to look into those things  SM Maybe look at the guidelines/checkpoints that relate to dynamically   generated content. For example, look at image fetched by scr5ipt and see if   it also fetches a text equivalent. There is a lot of stuff in ASP, JSP,   CFM, ... - maybe be specific and it would be more manageable.  WC It is basically an authoring tool  AG or the technology no longer supports partitioning the world into those   things.  TS is there a framework in place where we can say "here is our generic   means for doing it" and people can adopt the model and their engine deals   with a pointer mechanism The default that makes sense is a URI. I could   then make something that points into PHP myself...  DD Requirement for scope should be kept in mind as we design a system so we   don't close the door, but focus on what you need as a toolmaker. discussion   is to be aware that we might want to use the description for a larger   scope, but this working group should focus on web content first  TS I agree. That would be a start  AG To index into PHP you need something else. If we divide into cream and   skim milk,. you would like a report that says the problem is here in the   PHP. We have standard indexing into XML. We don't have a standard way of   fabricating that for programing languages.  WC Right. ECMAscript could be a proof of concept.  CMN 2 things. There are well-defined serialization for a lot of programming   languages already And we should spend our time on building an initial tool   and seeing where we are at - we could spend a long time not getting   anywhere because we can't solve all problems at once  DP Good start targets are XML, poor HTML, and ECMAscript  LK We make sure we don't prevent ourselves from doing this, but our initial   focus is those three  HB Poor HTML. If we tidy it, I don't think it is reversible.  <Geeze> I just put toothpaste back into the tube and unscrambled an egg so   I should be able to untidy that poor HTML?  CMN Poor HTML and tidied XHTML result are in same domain - one has been   repaired somewhat.  JG Is it a requirement for invalid HTML?  DP The stuff you find on the web today.  CMN Invalid HTML is a subset of poor HTML  LK We are figuring out how. Can we close off whether we will? So we want to   do the work for XML, lousy HTML, and ECMAscript.  <Geeze> The fact we're figuring out how presumes we've agreed on whether?  TS I propose CSS.  Resovled: Ultimate scope: Tools, web content, programming languages used to   generate it  DD Do we want to call it EDL?  LK 3 minutes  DD Don't care, but idea of more general would be good.  <Geeze> We're going to "evaluate" Prolog and Lisp? Whoopee!  Resolved: we will call it EDL  <Al> Bill, what this says is that the output of the KGV evaluating XHTML   1.3 validity is one of the things EDL may describe. Ultimate goals include   schemas, DTDs, databases  Resolved: we want to start by publishing something  DP concerned of the scope of work. Does it cover input side?  <Geeze> How about "accessibility features of RDF" parallel to   SVG/XML/CSS/SMIL papers of the same title?  CMN meaning?  dp: input side is test definitions. output side is EDL content, and   delivery of that to people  DD We are saying that the programmatic system that leads to an EDL is out   of scope - it is up to the tool to decide what kind of knowledge base to   use. eg are they using AERT?  DP That diminishes the value  <Geeze> then we won't have to pay a VAT?  CMN I thought that we had just agreed that we would work on 3 specific   input types - HTML-rubbish, XML, and Javascript, against some kind of   scheme (My underlying assumption was AERT)  AG does that assumption underlie the consensus?  DD Yes, WC Yes  <Geeze> *YES*!  LK we make this stuff, and say "and furthermore, we recommend this file be   used for... would that make you happier?  DP Yes  CMN agrees  WC doesn't that get into inferences and how to process them?  JG Are we going to talk about accessibility, or other uses to?  WC Once we can show it we can get other people to use it for other stuff.  <Geeze> The ADL subset of EDL  LK what would be one or two initial things to do with it?  DP Feed it to a repair tool  WC Feed it to insight...  LK RIght now Wave displays a test. If it includes a test something else makes  AG Can you consolidate a report with the metachecker  WC Some tools may not do any repair  LK Get some summary human readable report. As far as feeding it into repair...?  DP Suggest one is a variant on the other. One is presented for people. THe   other may have different  content and be targeted at a machine interface.  DP the raw output is ugly for machines, transform it to a pretty thing for   a user to read  LK We want one tool use it to help the user make a repair. Is it useful to   make use of this, or would it make sense to plug this stuff right into   dreamweaver?  SM We have a ajavascript API on dreamweaver - thinking about how to look at   this to look at the code, and then use it.  DD Sounds that a tool would read an EDL, step through the problem, and help   the user solve it.  WC Some of the examples of specialized tools - determining if the alt text   is useful for an image - you use it as a transfer format when you run that   plugin.  DD The intelligence to read EDL is less than to write it.  LK If all EDL did is say "you have missing alt text" it would be just as   easy to do it another way  DD But a human report that says "the alt text is no good" - that is helpful   for the tool to pick up on and help the user deal with  CMN Machine holds the repair functions, user can do fixing, and EDL says   which things need to be worked on  TS Piloted fixing - this is what we do. This isn't a tough thing to do.  HB Do you recheck everything? Or assume original observations were independent  TS At the moment we check all, but I would rather have it working via EDL  DP Like a spell checker ignore function.  TS In industry the QA people can export the info back to the developer and   get them to fix the problem  DD Success criteria? Define a format. Have tools output the format. Tools   read the format and provide human output. wizard that reads the format and   provides guided repair  CMN Add "read EDL and auto-repair" - e.g. validating HTML...  DD ADL part should include testing method in the specific case of   accessibility evaluation.  LK I think Phill Jenkins (IBM) had more in mind. Here is some usability   testing we did, here is the steps we did, ... test cases for a particular   application.  CMN give them aURI and I will give you some RDF that says what happened   (met or failed)  WC I envisaged this with WCAG 2.0 having technology-specific checkpoints.   So you conform to a requirement specific to your language (e.g. HTML) with   a number of requirements.  DD There will be a set of URIs that we can use to point to as tests?  WC Yes.  DD Do we have anything that could help identifying the method? Do we have a   schema that says "auto checking, manual checking? Do w need it?  DP Up to the implementor  WC We have been working on that - looking at tests you can do.  DD That is AERT?  WC IT doesn't live anywhere. THat would be best in WCAG.  DP I can't see the requirements in initial scope working for filling in   forms, etc.  DD What was meant?  LK Phill was saying we do user testing - I want to document that if I click   Edit -> Find -> enter some text, and I get something inaccessible.  DP If you think what is involved with that, the DOM that XML relies on is   inadequate for that task.  LK Right. THis is describing the behaviour of a human testing a system.  WC maybe that belongs in ultimate scope not initial scope.  AG this makes manual checks incrementally more concrete.  <Geeze> So by evaluating output vs. tool used we are actually evaluating   the author?  <Geeze> This person who logged in as "love26" never even used this feature?  CMN shows http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-EVAL-20000913/  WC There are tools that use eye-tracking and predict how people track   through web pages.  [break]  LK Issue - include output?  <Geeze> using a rubber clock?  TS I suggested it. impetus is that the report should be transferable but I   don't know if that it applicable anymore. I don't think it is as important   anymore. It is purely derivative.  DD SO no longer a requirement?  Resolved. Not a requirement Combine results of different tools  DD Built in. If you can say which method was used, then you can combine them  DP I think this is where my scoping question comes. If I don't have   information about the tests and the tester I can't derivethat  DD You will.  DP We are starting to put requirements on the application  TS I think it is the resolution with respect to the source document that   says where the tests are  DP That is a definition of a test  CMN I don't think you will, I think that you may and teh system will still   work. So long as the system supports having that information I hink it is OK  DP requirement should be that teh results include source of test and teh   authority of the test itself  HB e.g. the human that made the judgement  TS The attribution should be the auto-test or the human who judged it  DD draws diagram  {subject of eval} --[the evaluation]--> {thing}  {description of test} --[description]--> {thing} <--[ ]--{test}  {SSB}--[test judge]--> {test} <--[method]-- {some test algorithm}  <Geeze> EDL includes a spot for who/when so the info as to who made the   judgement inheres?  DP This says "A tool that SSB wrote says 'X'"  TS This is part of RDF - I make a set of assertions. "SSB says this alt is   OK" and "a smarter person says it doesn't"  <Geeze> "A tool that SSB wrote and was used by "Y" at (time) says "X". etc.  DD There is a human per test?  CMN for a set of evaluations, you can attribute them all to a person and   state that the person making assertions about manual tests did them  HB What happens if there is a conflict?  <Geeze> per EDL tool use instance.  TS Is there a way to resolve who said what?  DD That is the real meat of EDL. The same framework can be used to evaluate   a SMIL browser.  DP I think what you have there is more detailed. What you are talking about   is a higher level. If you wrap up a group of tests I would be happy.   individual test consist of a URI, what, and how.  <Geeze> authoring = browsing = evaluating =  DD Schema will provide slots for saying what, how, ... and we have to come   up with defaults - the person making the obverall statement is default for   who did it. and so on.  <Geeze> whoever logged onto EDL assumes responsibility  DD So we need to some up with IDs for tools that are used to do tests and   scheme for them  LK There are rules for assigning priority to tests. There are compliance   assertions that depend on them. Within the scope of what we are doing do we   want to define them?  TS I think you can point top that with the description of the test  DP the priorities are only relative within a group of tests.  <Geeze> No, because the "regulations" might change but the "evaluation"   won't for a particular user test X has priority A but for another user it   has priority B A user can feed in their priority scheme. But that is out of   scope.  LK Do we want to make that part of the scope? If not we have a log file but   no conclusion.  TS Doesn't it make sense for that to be the description of the test?   argument about the shape of the scheme and which bit goes where...  <Geeze> <lang es>no me importa</lang>  LK there is a case for being able to give a level of confidence to a test   result.  <Geeze> 3.7 stars?  LK yeah. For alt text... it might be woeful, just not very good, or really   rather fine...  DD priority of a test is not defined in EDL but it is linked.  DP My organization has combined a bunch of different tests. Chaals has a   different set. for my organization... they may demand a particular set of   requirements  <Geeze> And some will use the Legion of Decency Index to find out which   movies to go to rather than which to skip.  CMN In the confidence rating?  DP In marking scheme  CMN This doesn't define a marking scheme. just a lot of yes/no factoids  DD We are doing the same test, but for WAI it is critical, for dave it is   nice to have. So priority setting is outside.  LK Needa piece that says how to combine these outside priorities...  <Geeze> That's called "CDL"  LK Do we want to point to a statement?  AG The question is what is the way you assess 65%? you have sum(accessible   nodes) / sum(present nodes) for example  <Geeze> In GPA it's below mediocre, in an election it's a landslide.  AG the filter that weights the tests is an organizational policy  LK how you state the policy is outside the scope?  AG The way you state the policy depends on what we are doing, but doesn't   sit inside it.  CMN e.g. you could write priority scheme in PICS  LK We are not going to say anything about the format of priority schemes...  AG they must be pointable from the rest  CMN you only have to point the priorities into the test.  AG wrong. You need to be able to point to where the problem was  CMN but not from in the EDL tests. From the pp, that does more  DP I just need to be able to say test 163 has priority 154. The application   dealing with these can decide how to deal with the priorities  CMN There is not a requirement on this that tests are prioritized. That is   another level up  <Geeze> Maybe Al can run this by Eric and I'll take it up with Kynn?  DD HTML validation. there are a number of tests. All auto.  DP There is that use case. There is also a website where I have a bunch of   relative priorities that are for my organization. I will completely forget   some things and insist on others.  <Geeze> The "Friday" principle: just the facts "ma'am" - what you make of   them is up to you.  CMN That is an early stage development case. We should demo it using WAI   priority scheme, but should keep it out of the basic tests  DP I agree it is out of the initial scope, but required for it to be   commercially useful  LK You need to be able to deal with multiple URIs - e.g. two pages with   inconsistent navigation...  DD You use a bag, which is a URI.  LK Why make it a URI?  <Geeze> [SBP] it's all about whether EDL contains stuff that isn't properly   part of it.  DD When we are in the detail of RDF encoding we might find it is practical   to have a list.  LK This is different.  <Sean> [WL] So they're discussing about making the scope for EDL even wider???  cmn: SBP nope.  <Sean> Whew.  <Geeze> [SBP:] Sort of. Some of them want such things as priority levels be   inside EDL rather than using pointers.  cmn: nah, we seem to have decided we don't want that.  <Geeze> Whew  LK there are tests that intrinsically require two URI's  <Sean> Good, we should point to stuff from EDL, not include.  LK e.g. do text links match image map? there are two URI's. the test has to   point to the URIs of each piece.  <Geeze> DUH!  AG the definition of the test includes a template which may define multiple   references into the thing under test for the specific test there is a   binding to particular pointers (multiple)  HB Conclusions may differ pointer to pointer  AG no. THat is if there are multiple things to test. THis is "are X and Y   equivalent - you need to name X and Y to make the test clear  <Sean> [WL:] Is there any consensus on what the EDL structure is going to be?  DD I don't want to force cases to use multiple pointers when it isn't   always necessary  <Sean> If you use XLink having multiple links is very easy  <Geeze> [SBP:] I think it's whatever we (you 'n' me) make it.  LK so use a one-URI test where applicable, and create a complex node for   test that need to refer to more than one thing. That's getting into the   nitty gritty a lot.  <Sean> [WL:] I hope so. We seem to be moving away from the point rather a lot.  DP we've got the item we test, the test itself, part of the test i have   results. al, you said something about the assertion.  dp can't remember bell that rang... subject/object does not capture it.  al: subject/object/result that's on the test app.  dp: ya.  DD draws diagram  [16:25] > [15:45] > {subject of eval} --[the evaluation]--> {thing}  [16:25] > [15:46] > {description of test} --[description]--> {thing}  <--[ ]--{test}  {SSB}--[test judge]--> {test} <--[method]-- {some test algorithm}  hb: top level meta data about suite using.  cmn test id.  <SBP> The things that you have pasted in look very much like triples...  <wendy> yes, i suppose it is examples of the bubbles on the board.  dd: from the "desc of test" i want to point to a WAI document (e.g. AERT)  cmn priorities are diff than test. might be in same doc. id of test (refers   to description of test)  dd: hb question is where find version of test.  cmn test id. it identifies a particular test by version. URI dated version.  dd: id identified version but version is in the test. from id find what   version running.  cmn ya  lk can't tell if 2 people run the test using diff version can't tell which   more recent version. unless check doc or human may read.  tim: if same tool read same test 2x's replace assertions.  cmn must explicitly state dated tests versions.  dd can have same statement twice. policy question. will tool bark.  dP: actually app that generate real codes could change. test descrip. could   change while app stays the same. test not reflect description.  cmn pick which to refer.  lk could have a doc that changes w/so many tests. it changes. new version.   2 people apply same test, not obvious getting diff results.  dp: messes w/quality.  lk: confuses human . ideally put tests into a format where each one is   wrapped in  something. so we know if referring to same test.  tim: e.g. of test changing?  dp: corporate color changes from green to purple, on corp web site says   "corp color is X" a test looks for specific rbg value. series of tests   passes,until the rule changes then fails. at some point either abstract   source test data or do something to tie them together. otherwise blow quality.  lk therefor w3cneeds atomic tests.  wc yes, idea for 2.0  dp: if remain frozen.  lk: if have separate uri for each test a way for machine to know that 1-7   changed, and rest did not.  cmn don't produce change list in machine readable format.  wc need schema for tests so machine can read.  dP scope!!!!  lk we've generated work for other groups.  * Sean agrees with Wendy. Need to produce Schemas.  <Geeze> we've generated work for the entire W3C  ag: if generating engine that ...  <Sean> [GL: Too much work, the scope is much too wide  now]  ag: cmn saying we're generating more work for someone else.  cmn: not enough for them to be committed to yet. we are going to build   something and until we built that we  don't have something for them to commit to.  dp: each test which when in use shall have a stable URI (with help from cmn)  dp the content has to be static and it's uri as well.  <Al> Sean: the graphs on the board have more than three nodes in them.   Maybe we could reverse engineer these graphs into a graph grammar of   triples...(reply from before you fell off) or you pull it into a local copy.?  <Sean> Yes. That can be done. I have models that use an odd number of nodes   in them  lk: if requirements document wrap in a span or div, if sufficient struct   take 2 docs, do a diff...  <Sean> mainly from my XHTML to RDF thing. SiRPAC uses genIDs to fix it.  lk: can say which requirements changed which didn't.  dP: not quality.  <Sean> Al: Is that what you mean?  DP: diff set of tests.  tim: only see using this to transport data between eval and repair. if want   static...  dp: yes, content needs to remain fixed.  lk as a procedure: if diff people judging have them use the same version.   otherwise diff opinions could be caused by diff reqs.  dd: i am concerned about solidity of model wrt to outside changes. and   factorization. if we generate docs that are 2 megs to express facts that's   a problem. maybe when look at rdf detail can find way to express. at some   point have a ref that something is missing.  <Sean> They mean that the EDL system will generate a lot of garbage  dd how do we cope with adding EDL to existing file... versioning should be   brought inside.  so we can make management easier.  <Sean> But if you point to stable definitions (i.e. Schemas) as URIs, you   save a lot of the descriptive waste  dd ya    next steps  dd we need to assign someone to encode the model in rdf w/real vocab. i   need to look at for conformance point of view.  <Geeze> wonder who?  <Sean> :-)  dd, lk, cmn, wc  dd: assign someone to revise the EDL document.  (sean's summary)  dp: request that scope be included.  ag: expand pls.  dp: scope of work w/very clear boundaries need to be explicitly stated.  wc got it.  <wendy> sean? you gonna revise your summary?  <Sean> Yes, fine!  <Geeze> We've made ADL into EDL and this is a "good thing" IMO. What it   promises is that the group meeting tomorrow will have to realize that they   will be lobbying heavily with other W3C entities to acknowledge/advise/help   in all this.    $Date: 2000/12/11 21:31:25 $    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

      Marshall,    Thank you for writing this up!    Based on all of this information, do you think there is anything missing   from the current draft of the reformulation?  Is there something else we   need to add?    Do you know how this changes as the eye is less able to distinguish between   colors or shapes?    What about people with Attention Deficit Disorder?  Does the delay in   movement apply to them as well?  It is my understanding that it doesn't,   that any movement will continue to distract them. Lisa, can you comment on   this?

      Thanks to Chris for taking these.    Minutes available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2000/11/27-minutes.html    27 November 2000 ERT WG Telecon  Participants  ?       Brian Matheny  ?       Harvey Bingham  ?       Sean Palmer  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Chris Ridpath  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Dick Brown    Topic: Face To Face Meeting on December 4-5  LK: This will be a joint meeting with PF group. First day is ER only,   second day is with PF. (Len can only attend first day.) We will also be   coordinating with AU. Anybody know how busy is PF?  WL: Lots of overlap between us and PF. PF has plenty to do because of W3C work.  LK: Ideas for day 1 topics?  WC: Recent email on list, titled "Requirements for ADL", had questions   about ADL. Perhaps we could discuss these questions.  LK: Not all questions answered.  WC: Topic could be to answer questions.  LK: Yes.    Topic: Accessibility Description Language (ADL)  WL: ADL - Why was it created could be topic. Design of ADL should be addressed.  LK: We should discuss high level of ADL and implementation details.  WL: High level is clear.  LK: What should it apply to? HTML and XHTML? Any XML, like SVG, it should   apply to.  HB: Lots of XML is database to database and should not apply to that.   Should only apply if doc has end user.  SP: All user interface technologies - it should apply to.  HB: If eventually sees user then it should apply to.  DB: Schema must have setup for access info.  SP: If user interface is not needed then accessibility info is not needed.  HB: Yes, but may only know at source database. If database is serving   images then should have ALT text.  SP: yes.  LK: Yes, even database to database should include ALT text.  LK: What sort of guidelines are needed for ADL?  WC: Create semantically rich documents. Like allow images with ALT.   Language should support guidelines.  LK: ADL general framework - statements point to something like elements,   attributes or whole site.  WC: Two different things - schemas and content. WCAG 2 has new checkpoint   that says "Conform to XML accessibility guidelines", so this is needed.  WL: XML Accessibility Guidelines!? (XML AG)  WC: PF is doing it.  LK: Is publicly available?  WC: Yes, link but is hidden from ER page.  WL: Is this DD note?  WC: Yes. But is PF work so they should do it. We don't know outcome. Will   likely come back to WCAG but don't know for sure.  LK: Should ADL work on XML? Yes. Anyone see a complication?  Everyone: No.  LK: What about XML with syntax errors?  SP: Should not be syntax errors if conforms to WCAG P1 guideline.  LK: Even if has syntax errors we should be able to point to errors and note   it is bad.  WC: We must leave in syntax problems - people may put them there for a reason.  LK: Even CSS. If well formed XML then can use Xpath. CSS, ECMA script,   HTML, or XML with syntax errors.  WC: XML if not well formed then browser will crash. Tool could be same way.   Or could clean up.  LK: Or tool could say "sorry invalid. Try again later".  WC: Question is "will we address" and I think answer is yes.  LK: If we see huge problem then do we address?  WL: What is ADL then?  LK: Specific language spec.  WL: Output of Wave, Bobby Aprompt?  HB: Static list or environment where repair can be made.  WC: Implementation detail.  HB: Standard way of reporting (can be shared among tools)?  WC: Yes.  LK: scope - defining language yes. Should also include presentation details?  WC: Could be scope of group in implementation, but not in language.  LK: Group will have at least one implementation.  WC: What is this going to be? A note or W3C recommendation? Must have at   least 2 implementations for recommendation.  LK: For example, AU can't be recommendation candidate?  WC: AU went through before 2 implementation requirement was in place. Used   many different tools to show that they can be done. Candidate requirement   is now stronger.  WL: How did RDF get through?  WC: Don't know.  SP: Schema has been in for about a year.  WL: RDF is dependent on schemas getting accepted.  LK: Why need schemas for RDF?  WC: Schema is like table definition. When apps communicate, schema will lay   foundation for discussion. Like DTD for HTML - "here's what you can expect".  DB: If no place for ALT then ALT will not be there.  WL: Web is like database so schemas could define data.  WC: Right. Like early days of HTML when browsers made best guesses. Can use   RDF without schema but schema is good for strict typing and namespaces.   More audit trail and can avoid anarchy.  LK: Essential for RDF like other XML languages.  SP: RDF schemas are not XML schemas.  SP: Just proposed specs for RDF. Maybe writing for Dublin Core.  WL: Are we like Dublin core for accessibility?  WC: Charles has proposed something similar. Expresses if complies to WCAG   but also could include meta data about site.  WC: Can attach attributes to anything that has a URI.  LK: More than just attributes? Is ADL more than just attributes?  WC: What kind of inferences or logic would you like to include?  LK: Examples: what expert says etc.  WC: Like a database. Could perform a comparison of statements and facts.  LK: ADL could be a simple XML app. Or could be RDF app. Not implementation   detail.  WC: XML tables of data. RDF expresses relationship between data. So is not   either/or but likely both. (Both are XML.)  LK: Could be nothing but RDF.  WC: Right. We're looking at scope now and need to know what to bring to PF.  SP: Anybody seen Tim Berners-Lee 'design issues' document?  Everyone: No or very little.  SP: Will send URL to list. Tim & Dan describing web problems. Describing   semantic web is very well laid out. Applies to what we want ADL to do.   Parallels to ADL.  LK: Can anyone think of an example of accessibility description that avoids   RDF?  WC: A-Prompt does it?  CR: New Java version does it (uses XML only).  LK: So what does RDF buy us?  WL: The 'f' (framework).  SP: XML is just data. RDF is metadata. Since ADL is meta data, why create   more XML? RDF gives meaning so that's why it's needed.  WC: Interesting question to PF. Since PF reviews all W3C specs they see all   problems and they can think about this.  WC: PF can check our thinking and see how it fits in with other work.  LK: HTML already has Meta tags.  WL: Backwards compatibility, we want forwards compatibility.  LK: What does RDF buy us?  SP: RDF is more universal (will work in not HTML files). Meta tags does not   mean anything unless you know the XML but schemas are more universal.  LK: Self documenting, applies to other that HTML.  WL: We get more aggressive about our data about data.  LK: HTML spec has info about how to create doc that doesn't validate.  SP: Modularization is needed for other namespacing.  LK: Anybody working on module to put RDF into XHTML?  SP: Yes. Needed by others.  WC: Put on agenda - updates on XHTML and other info about this.  WL: Do have attribute in Head in XHTML for putting in metadata. What about   the 'profile' file?  SP: Works for now. Can put RDF in to XHTML and is now used in W3C home page.  WL: What use can be made of it?  SP: Rich summary of W3C page. Can be used for extracting info about   accessibility. Example - could be used to find W3C WCAG compliance logo and   create WCAG compliance statement.  LK: If page is XHTML then could get tools to work on accessibility checking?  SP: Yes.  LK: (back to agenda) We need talks on technology.  WC: Yes.  SP: May attend by phone. What is needed by me?  WC: Example of what RDF buys us.  LK: Please put URIs on mailing list. Should we brainstorm ideas on what ADF   will be like?  WC: Useful and instructive.  LK: Future discussion on list.  WC: Ask people to provide test pages.  LK: Break into 2 or 3 groups and compare results. Will continue discussion   on list.      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        Hello,    Paul, Cynthia, and I took an action item at the 23 May telecon [1] to   suggest improved success criteria for Checkpoint 1.2 regarding real-time   information.    We've put together a proposal at [2].  Our proposed changes are marked with   the class "proposed" and appear in white text with a red background.    The complete text of checkpoint 1.2 appears on this page, but we have only   changed the pieces that are marked.  We wanted to see it in context.    Notes:  - The "unless" clause on SC # 4 is derived from "Federal Captioning   Mandates: What They Are and What They Mean to You." [3]  - We asked Geoff Freed about real-time audio descriptions.  He said that   they (NCAM) have provided audio descriptions on special occasions but there   is nothing happening regularly in the broadcast world that he is aware of.    Thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/05/23-minutes.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/05/cp1-2.html  [3] http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/captioncenter/cis.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      I took an action in today's meeting to rewrite the mission statement in the   charter.  How's this?    The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:  to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if a Web site is   accessible and when it is not,  to make it easier for Web content developers to repair inaccessible Web sites.    The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools,   developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement.    thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      DRAFT - 2 Checkpoints for HTML, XML, SMIL, and CSS    I only considered two checkpoints in an attempt to create technology   specific checkpoints. It is interesting that in each of these cases, the   technology-specifics are highlighted. I think what we will find is that we   will have general principles but that those are principles of design and   not markup language. Each markup language has a strength and not all design   principles will apply to each of those strengths. For example, separating   presentation and content means that two languages may be employed for the   desired effect. Therefore, if we do have technology-specific checks they   will be tied to other technology-specific checks. For example, XML and   style sheets.    The draft is available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/05/wcag-techs.html    Note that it is very rough.

LK send note to delorie developer before adding info to the list of tools page.  Resolution: let authors know what text we're going to include, and ask that   they keep us up to date.  LK volunteered to review a few tools.  WC make link to exisiting tools list more prominent on the ER list.  WL will look at the list of tools and see if i can take any.  LK will ask everyone on the list to write something for at least one of the   tools.  resolved: the people on this call agree that "Techniques for Web   accessibility evaluation and repair tools" and if someone wants to suggest   something new and gather consensus.  Resolved: plan for publishing a public document: WC finish going through   comments on my comments, then we all need to reread to ensure that WC   didn't break anything. then send to IG let them review for 1 or 2 weeks,   incorporate their comments, then become public. Therefore, we'll publish   tomorrow review over the week and discuss at next week's meeting.

Anne,    Have you ever heard of WYNN [1]?  It's a tool created by AccessAbility,   Inc. to help people who have difficulties reading.  It provides a variety   of cues and configurations to help people read text.  For example, for some   people the letters might bleed together if the letters are too close   together, so with WYNN you can configure how much space appears between   each letter.  It will also highlight words as it reads them outloud to you.    CAST has a similar tool called "eReader" [2]. Here is a statement on their   product web page, "CAST eReader is a software tool designed to support   learners of all ages who may lack the skills needed to read materials   independently. The software can take electronic text content from any   source and read it using synthesized speech and visual highlighting. The   program's universal design features allow it to meet a wide range of needs,   abilities and interests, supporting those who have difficulty reading. "    Therefore, I don't think it is "wrong." There are a variety of reading   difficulties that one can experience and there are a variety of strategies   to make reading easier or possible depending on the needs of the reader.    --wendy    [1] http://www.4access.com/products/wyr.htm  [2] http://www.cast.org/udl/index.cfm?i=197  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      I have two questions in relation to this issue:  1. will user agents automatically make adjustments for background or   foreground color if the author specifies a good combination but the user   only specifies one or the other (foreground or background but not   both)?  It is my experience that user agents do not.    2. I intend to include this in the techniques document, but would like a   rationale.  It seems that the rationale is good design rather than an   accessibility issue since the answer to the first question seems to be "no."    If there is no disagreement, I propose editing section 5 (Colors) of the   CSS techniques module to read:  <blockquote>  Use these CSS properties to specify colors:  'color', for foreground text color.  'background-color', for background colors.  'border-color', 'outline-color' for border colors.  For link colors, refer to the :link, :visited, and :active pseudo-classes.    Note that when a background color is specified, specify a high-contrast   foreground color and vice-versa.    Ensure that information is not conveyed through color alone. For example,   when asking for input from users, do not write "Please select an item from   those listed in green." Instead, ensure that information is available   through other style effects (e.g., a font effect) and through context   (e.g,. comprehensive text links).  For instance, in this document, examples are styled by default (through   style sheets) as follows:  They are surrounded by a border.  They use a different background color and also specify a high-contrast   foreground color.  They begin with the word "Example" (or "Deprecated Example".  They also end with the phrase "End example", but that phrase is hidden by   default with 'display: none'. For user agents that don't support style   sheets or when style sheets are turned off, this text helps delineate the   end of an example for readers who may not be able to see the border around   the example.  </blockquote>  --wendy    At 12:59 AM 6/7/00 , Wendy A Chisholm wrote:  > From the issues list:  >  ><blockquote>  >Issue raised by: Philip Newton - 7 May 1999  >Issue:  >If the author specifies a background color, they should also specify the   >foreground color (and vice versa), otherwise if the user has selected a   >particular foreground color that does not contrast well with the author's   >background color, the page will be unreadable.  >  >Proposed Resolution  >While the user should be able to adjust preferences on the user agent, it   >is good design.

        issue: should we have a css (for example) document that stands on its own?   if we have checklists where every item must be met for conformance, then   techniques documents should take a similar form. In other words, since CSS   can not be used alone to meet all of the success criteria it should not   exist as a separate document.  It is fine for it to exist as a separate   source file but should not be used to generate a separate document.    discussion:  - if a person working on the css part of their work, they are likely to   want a css-specific document.  -  are techniques documents means to conformance (like checklist)?  - we can generate a checklist easy enough that will incorporate the various   technologies that someone is using, but will we be generating entire   techniques documents?  - would we end up with one long techniques document that contains   everything?  technologies are intended to be used together.    propose: log this issue in the requirements document. attempt to move on to   get techniques requirements published.  won't know the answer until we get   further along.    action mc: log this as an issue in the techniques requirements    ===  schema and templates    richard gave an overview of work on i18n templates.  he hopes to develop a variety of templates for a variety of audiences.   create a shell to pull in info as needed.    issue: create a template for every possible output? e.g., a template for   html+css and another for svg+script.  then someone says, "i want   svg+html+css" how would they get that?    discussion:  - they would have to create it. or  perhaps write an xsl specific to that   document. to create these views, create an xml file with structure and xsl   to extract the info at which point.  - templates vs dynamic generation. i18n also planning for dynamic   generation? not now b/c of complexity needed to generate   dynamically.  relationships defined in template not in database.    propose (for wcag): use templates for short-term since relationships in   database will be complex.  use work on templates to help define what   relationships need to be defined in database and how to define them.    ===  editing process possibility:  1. attach editors to different source documents  2. submission process (form to generate xml and send to editors), editors   add to source  then multi-people not editing same thing at same time.    ===  action: wac work on schema and tools (talk w/altova re: xmlspy authentic   view of xmlspec+richard's extensions??)  action: bc continue work on the checklist (prototype).  action: mc revise techniques requirements  action: mc and bf to review html techniques and begin submitting proposals   to the list (for changes in content)  action: all discuss new phrase to replace "rules" on thread on w3c-wai-gl  action: mc look at templates    ===  tomorrow: some of this will come up at tomorrow's wcag telecon    next week: report back on action items and discuss schema  milestone: next week we'll start to put in place for creating a document   (although likely to be somewhat underway based on current action items)    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      going through older mail...    Charles, part of your list of what scripts should _not_ be used for is   already included in the HTML module of the techniques document.  refer to   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#scripts-gt    What is not included I will add.    I would disagree that all browser sniffing by scripts is a bad thing.  An   example that I heard yesterday is that Netscape 4.0 and 4.01 have very bad   support of style sheets.  Therefore, an author can determine that those   browsers should receive the base style sheet while other browsers, such as   Netscape 4.5, receive a more complicated style sheet.    What I do agree should be avoided is sniffing for only the most recent   browser and telling everyone else, "you need to upgrade."  especially when   they only sniff for Microsoft and Netscape leaving Opera and other recent   browers out of the fun.    The other techniques you asked about:  1. Dancing or scrolling status lines  2. "rollover" scripts - providing a highlight for a mouse rollover.     From what I remember, older screen readers used to have a problem with   scrolling status lines.  Text in marquees, whether created with a MARQUEE   element, a script or a Java applet, was read as text appeared on the screen   whether in the status line or in the main window it was read.  We need to   recreate these tests with today's browser and screen reader configurations.    For people who read slowly, if there is important information that scrolls   they may not be able to read it in time.  Also, as I understand it, for   some people with attention disorders they may be so drawn to the movement   that the rest of the page almost becomes invisible.    Rollover scripts can be a problem if they pop up additional information.  I   have not heard of problems if they just change the appearance of a link,   unless new information is being provided that is not obvious.    I think the general statement of scripts is "use them with care."    Last year I worked on scripts and style sheets for a while and wrote up   some thoughts which are available at:   http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/~chisholm/dhtml/  This is not completely up to date with where i left off, nor is the work   completed. I will be returning to this work in the near future.    --wendy    Charles wrote:      >SO what should scripts not be used for? Here is my preliminary list.

        Yes, we went through it before.    I have collected the URIs at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/resref.html    We will be adding to this as we collect more references on a variety of   topics (not just color perception).    Does anyone want to help me gather the various links, resources, papers,   and etc. that we have referred to over the last few months?    e.g., Lisa I know you contributed several links for references for learning   disability. Could you help me dig those up?    Thanks,  --wendy    At 12:54 AM 5/31/02, Lisa Seeman wrote:  >We went through all this, not that long ago.

      Phil and Charles,  I have reworked my proposal. does this cover your suggestions and questions?    <proposal>  1. Flag images with:  * the IMG attribute alt="", alt=" ", and alt=" " (or alt=" ")  * OBJECT (of type="image/gif" or "image/png" etc.) that has no text content.  (Note that OBJECTs of other types should be handled elsewhere in the ERT   document.)    2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., <a   href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=" ">Refer to our home page</a>)   this is o.k.    3. If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the   image.    3a. If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those   words should not be separated, advise them to use   (or alt=" ")   instead of an image.    3b. If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text,   advise them to use style sheets, IMG alt=" ", or spaces in the content of   OBJECT.    3c. If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to   provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary a longer description.    3d. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of   the page, advise them to provide either brief descriptive text, that they   handle it as a "space" (see 3b), and suggest that they may also want to   provide a longer description of the image (on IMG with the "longdesc"   attribute or as text in the content of OBJECT).    Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style   sheets, such as graphical list bullets. Advise authors to use style sheets.   (See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document).  </proposal>    How does an author know when to do what for 3d?    An example situation.  I have a page where My Company's logo is displayed   several times.  The first use is a link to our home page.  The text content   is, "My Company's home page."  I'm very proud of how detailed we made the   logo, so I provide a longer description of it.  On the bottom of the page   we provide a row of the logos - the same image over and over again.  It's a   branding presentation effect.  The first logo has the text equivalent "My   Company" the rest have a space. I do describe the effect for my friends who   used to have sight because I think I can describe it well enough for them   to form a mental image.    This is the "extremely friendly" version.    the "basic" would be:  I have a page where My Company's logo is displayed several times.  The   first use is a link to our home page.  The text content is, "My Company's   home page."  On the bottom of the page we provide a row of the logos - the   same image over and over again.  It's a branding presentation effect.  They   all have a space for a text equivalent.    I don't see a clear algorithm for how to walk an author through the   decisions.  Ideas?    --w    At 07:15 PM 12/6/99 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Although I agree that a brief description in alt values is redundant, I would  >suggest that a longdesc is often appropriate.

      Based on Michael's comments, I have created the following technique.  I   replaced the text that was there with this text.    Technique 3.6.A [priority 2] Check that list elements are within a list   container and well nested.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Not allowed:  LI element used outside of an OL, UL, DIR, or MENU element.  Not allowed: DT or DD element used outside of a DL element  Suspicious: excessive nesting of lists. The following example indicates   that list markup is creating a formatting effect rather than indicating a   list structure:  <UL> <UL>  <UL> <UL>                                             <LI>  </UL> </UL> </UL> </UL>  Suspicous: single list items within lists might indicate formatting rather   than structure.  For example:  <UL><LI>  </UL>  <UL><LI>  </UL>  Example Language:  List items should not be used for formatting text.  Repair Technique:  Allow the user to format the text within the LI element to another element.  Test Files and Discussion Files:  Link to discussion on this technique.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Provide text with timecodes that is classified as either caption or   video description.  this information can then be synchronized and   synthesized to speech, synchronized as captions, or collated into a   collated text transcript.    Keep in mind that for people who are deaf and blind, the combination of   both the captions and the text of the descriptive video (a "collated text   transcript") is their only means of accessing the information.    --wendy  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>        

      We discussed both the specifics of checkpoints 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 and guideline 4 overall.  Despite agreeing last week that 4.1 is advisory, there was discussion this week that perhaps if we reworded it differently it would still apply.  Cynthia took the action to work on the checkpoint text of 4.1 and 4.2 as follows:  <quote>  Action CS: rewrite 4.1 - along the lines of, "Checkpoint 4.1 Choose technologies that support interoperability and compatibility." and also include something in 4.2 along the lines of, "Include accessibility provisions where applicable."  </quote>    Jo and Lisa will work this week on 3.3 and send to the list for possible discussion next week.    Gregg and Wendy gave regrets for next week.  Could someone volunteer to take minutes?

        Hello,    Yesterday, I had a hard time explaining an issue about mapping   technology-specific "rules" to success criteria.  Here is an attempt to   make it clearer.    User agent support is one aspect of the problem. However, I am primarily   concerned that the minimum level success criteria for checkpoint 1.3 make   all HTML structural elements equally important.    In other words, it seems that some HTML structural elements are more   important to accessibility than others, but the minimum level success   criteria put them all at the same importance.    The minimum level success criteria for checkpoint 1.3 are:  1. any information that is conveyed through presentation formatting is also   provided in either text or structure.  2. the following can be derived programmatically (i.e. through AT   compatible markup or data model) from the content without interpreting   presentation.         a. any hierarchical elements and relationships, such as headings,   paragraphs and lists       b. any non-hierarchical relationships between elements such as   cross-references and linkages,  associations between labels and controls,   associations between cells and their headers, etc.       c. any emphasis      My interpretation of this puts all HTML structural elements at the same   priority. Here are all of the structural elements (per [1] which was   derived from the HTML 4.01 spec)  A  ABBR  ACRONYM  AREA  BLOCKQUOTE  BODY  BUTTON  CAPTION  CITE  CODE  COL  COLGROUP  DD  DFN  DIR* (deprecated)  DIV  DL  DT  EM  FIELDSET  FORM  H1-H6  HEAD  HTML  INPUT  ISINDEX* (deprecated)  KBD  LABEL  LEGEND  LI  MAP  MENU* (deprecated)  OL  OPTGROUP  OPTION  P  Q  SAMP  SELECT  SPAN  STRONG  TABLE  TBODY  TD  TEXTAREA  TFOOT  TH  THEAD  TR  UL  VAR    These seem to fall into 2 categories:    1. those elements that genuinely provide structure, are commonly used, and   make a much larger accessibility impact when they are used.  e.g. H1-H6,   UL, OL LI, TH, LABEL, etc.    2. those elements that are not commonly used or supported and do not   provide a large accessibility benefit. e.g. CITE, VAR, KBD, etc.    They don't provide a sizable benefit because if you don't know that   something is a citation by the markup hopefully you can glean that from the   context.  Unlike headings which can be used as navigation markers as well   as create the structure that the document is built on.    Does this make more sense now?  Can you see how a sub-priority scheme is   almost forming from this?  Or do you think they are all equally   important?  This might be an incorrect premise  on my part (that some are   less important to accessibility than others).    I look forward to answering Jason's question from yesterday's call, "Is   this an isolated instance or is it part of a more general problem?"  I   still need to find the notes from our talk last November, Jason.    Best,  --wendy    p.s. Yesterday I mentioned an overlap between 1.3 and 3.1. This is a   separate issue.

        Kynn,    Yes, the border between server-side techniues and how WCAG and ATAG apply   to them is fuzzy.  Content Management Systems (Matt's favorite topic :) is   a good, concrete example to begin the discussion between AUWG and WCAG   WG.  It will be interesting to hear if the AUWG talked about this   relationship (between CMS, ATAG and WCAG) at their F2F meeting last week.    If it hasn't been done yet, it would be interesting to list all of the   issues related to CMS, accessibility, WCAG and ATAG as a starting point for   a discussion.  Are you interested in taking a first pass or digging up what   has already been written?  (Matt?)    Perhaps server-side techniques could be a shared Techniques document   between ATAG and WCAG or at least have entry points for each set of   guidelines.  I'm not sure how that would work, but it could be something to   consider. We've discussed joint telecons between AUWG and WCAG WG, although   a particular date and time for a discussion has not been scheduled. Once we   do schedule a discussion,  this topic ought to be on the agenda.    I've created issue #309 as a placeholder for this topic [1].    --wendy    [1] http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=309    At 04:51 PM 6/16/2003, Kynn Bartlett wrote:    >FWIW, server-side scripting techniques would seem to fall somewhere  >between both the WCAG working group and the ATAG working group.

I think we can just cut the reference to "cry wolf".  I also have addressed   Len's first comment in this proposal (here is a rewritten introduction in   its entirety). Note, that i did not change the last paragraph. it is very   eloquent.  <blockquote>  The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has produced a foundation document,   The WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0), that describes   what must be done to make a Web page accessible to all.  Tools are needed   to help authors determine if a web site is accessible to everyone and to   help repair it if it is not.    This document builds on the WCAG 1.0 foundation by outlining techniques   that evaluation and repair tools may use to uncover accessibility problems   and possibly repair them. These techniques may be used by those who create   web authoring tools or by anyone interested in creating accessible Web   documents.    It is important that people with disabilities are included in the "anyone   interested in creating accessible Web content." Creating accessible Web   content is as important as accessing Web content. Therefore, evaluation and   repair tools themselves need to be accessible to people with   disabilities.  However, this document does not describe how to make the   user interface accessible. Please refer to the Authoring Tool Accessibility   Guidelines 1.0 for information on making the user interface accessible.    Many people using evaluation and repair tools may be new to the Web and   will not be familiar with the various markup languages that are used. Many   others will not know about Web accessibility.  Tools should be intuitive   and easy to use and available at a minimal cost. Tools should not generate   excessive warnings or false positive accessibility errors.    It is clear that only a limited set of the WAI Guideline's checkpoints may   be objectively tested by a software tool. There will still be a dependence   on the user's ability to use common sense to determine conformance to the   guidelines. It is imperative that any tool have features that assist in   reminding, without nagging; in helping, without demeaning; in suggesting,   without demanding. We hope that the techniques in this document,   implemented in software programs, will gently guide authors along the path   to more accessible documents.  </blockquote>    >  > > Messages displayed to the author if a problem is found  > > LRK:: Change to "Example of a message displayed.  > >  >CR:: Should the 'Example Language' section remain in the document?

In suggested language, we need to acknowledge that Checkpoint 6.1 and   Checkpoint 3.3 are mutually exclusive: one or the other will always be   triggered.  </blockquote>    I propose that if 3.3 (Check document for use of style sheets) is triggered   and fixed, then 6.1 should be triggered.  Thus the following would occur:  1.  the document does not use style sheets (3.3 triggered)  2. user adds style sheets  3. 6.1 triggered to verify that the style sheets transform gracefully    However, if style sheets are identified, then 3.3 is not triggered but 6.1 is.    I propose rewording 3.3 as:  <blockquote>  Technique 3.3.A [priority 2] Check document for use of style sheets.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Check document for presence of STYLE or LINK rel="stylesheet" elements   within the HEAD element or use of "style" attributes throughout the document.  Example Language:  Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. For example, use the   CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element to control font styles  Repair Technique:  Notify the user if the document does not use style sheets.  Once the user has added style sheets, trigger technique 6.1 to verify that   the document is readable when style sheets are not applied.  </blockquote>    I don't believe a link to 3.3 is need from 6.1. I propose that 6.1 says,  <blockquote>  Technique 6.1.A [priority 1] Verify that the document is readable when   style sheets are not applied.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Triggers:  -LINK element with a REL attribute set to 'stylesheet,'  -STYLE element,  -At least one "style" attribute used on any element.

      Yes, the UA section needs a lot of work.  I was hoping for feedback about   the AU dependencies first. I think the coordination and dependencies   between ER and AU will be very similar to ER and UA.  Therefore, I wanted   to smooth out the one I had the most experience with (AU) before tackling   the other (UA).    As I noted in my request for review of the charter, I was concerned that   perhaps I made the dependencies with AU WG too stringent in trying to make   the dependencies clear.    At the joint face2face between AU and ER we realized that ER would need to   have a similar relationship with UA as we have begun to form with AU.  Len   has an action item to discuss this with you, Jon.  The group felt that we   more than likely will want to have regular meetings with UA but we were   anticipating that UA would want to hold off on these until UAAG has gone to   Recommendation.    --wendy    At 05:51 PM 5/31/00 , Jon Gunderson wrote:  >Wendy,  >I would also like a more clear statement of the proposed relationship and   >I think it should be brought to the UA working group for discussion.  >  >Jon  >  >  >At 04:48 PM 5/31/00 -0400, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >>Couple of comments:  >>  >>The relationship with user agents should be more clearly sorted out (at the  >>moment the draft doesn't describe the relationship, just the UAWG).  >>  >>There is a question about what changes if maintaining a list of tools is done  >>in concert with AU.

        Hello,    There is more work to do, but a new draft is available.  This is primarily   to let you all review the latest structure I'm using.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2002/10/WD-EARL10-20021004.html    Major things to take care of before publishing as a TR draft:  1. make sure the use of terms in the prose matches the terms defined in the   schema  2. minor touch-ups on schema  3. outline issues related to the schema. My understanding is that we have 4   issues:       1. testMode - is it just manual and automatic or do we include   heuristic?       2. defining groups of test cases.       3. uniquely identifying user agents       4. uniquely identifying pieces of content (the hash/normalization issue)  4. Make sure all terms defined in schema are described in prose.  5. Clean up as many comments as possible.    For the classes and properties, I used a structure similar to what Nadia   suggested at the June F2F.  Let me know if this works.    Please review this draft for:  1. General flow and content  2. Is the intro too general?  Too long?  How does it flow?  3. Will a reader who doesn't know RDF or XML have difficulty understanding   what it is about?  4. Will a reader who knows RDF and XML find fault with any language used?   examples?  5. There are 2 intro paragraphs, which do you prefer?

        Hello,    Let's chat at the usual time and place:    17:00 to 22:00 GMT on Wednesday        Server: irc.w3.org      Port: 6665      Channel: #er    I've been working on a spec.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/EARL/    I've been generating it from the schema (xml rdf format). Here's the XSLT   (kind of ugly, but fun): http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/EARL/earl-spec.xsl    It still needs a lot of work, but I'd like to get some initial reactions   (i've mostly been playing w/the XSLT instead of writing   content...suggestions welcome...as well as EARL for the various user   scenarios towards the end).    Here's the current timeline:  - publish a more polished draft before the F2F (24-26 june)  - do some work on the spec at the F2F  - publish a revision soon after the F2F  - once we all agree on it, publish a working draft to TR and solicit wide   public review (make sure  to get comments from QAWG, RDF groups, etc.)  - incorporate comments and publish as a Note (there is ongoing discussion   about whether this will end up as a Note or be put on the Rec track)    Thoughts?  Reactions?    Also, I've been working on an XSLT that transforms LIFT XML output to   EARL.  Then I hope to do another transform that combines HiSoft EARL and   LIFT EARL into a checkpoint-by-checkpoint comparison of results for a   particular resource (i.e. I'm evaluating a mock-site and want to compare   the results that each tool gives me).    What have you been up to?  Please send a brief report.    Best,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

The call is scheduled   for 11 a.m. pacific/2 p.m. eastern and I will send call-in information to   people who respond to this message.  Please respond off-list.    The purpose of the call is two-fold:  1. bring together people from PFWG, AUWG, and WCAG WG for an initial   discussion of techniques for web applications.  2. brainstorm and collect issues with web applications.  for example, refer   to Mark Pilgrim's review of   gmail.  <http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/10/gmail-accessibility>    The reason for the ad hoc call and lack of scheduling is that I'm   presenting at WWW2004 next week and want to get some feedback before my   presentation.    (This same message was sent to WCAG WG:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004AprJun/0422.html)    Best,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

Dick Brown    Agenda  Agenda Item 1  Use of RDF to specify accessibility status of pages. This continues what we   were discussing last tuesday's joint meeting with AU.  Our action item there was to review the capabilities of RDF... at least at   a high level... and then think of some concrete examples of what assertions   we would want to write and what inferences we would want to extract.  Example assertions:  A particular image [specified in some way] has no ALT text.  A particular image has ALT text but it's accuracy has not been manually   checked  A particular image has ALT text and it's been check. [this is so that tool   doesn't keep asking you to check it]  This authority says that the following checkpoints are checked  Example inferences:  Based on assertions from a particular authority, this page is accessible.  Based on assertions from multiple authorities, this page is accessible.  This page would be accessible with the following browsers ...    Agenda Item 2  Use of classes to define parts of a document (see discussion of "Grouping   Links" at 31 July minutes.    References for monday  We just have to skim to get general idea... you can pick and choose from...  ?       RDF spec (contains built in tutorial)  There are a number of intros to RDF on that page. A few that caught our   eye.. don't know if they are the best...  ?       Lassila  ?       Bray  ?       Miller  ?       Ianella  ?       Elements within a document may be referred to without anchors by   ?      XPointers Tutorial  ?       XPointer candidate rec  ?       ATAG Demo of RDF statements and inferences  ?       Charles and Dan's exchange about classes  ?       Dan's notes Grounding link relationships and classes names in the Web    RDF  HB Decreases clutter, they're all in the HEAD element.  WL Could be like external style sheets. Clutter is just link to RDF document.  LK In CMN example, when he refers to a resource, he spells out the full URI   each time. With namespaces you could define an abbreviation that refers to   the URI.  If you use a particular set of names a lot you can use those as the default   names. As far as the end user is concerned this is all transparent.  WL I've started a new web site called rdf.pair.com/intro.html I would like   some help on quotes and references. "Sipping from a firehose."  LK A quote on the page says that the difference from previous technologies   is that previously centralized and now decentralized.  WL A zillion accessibility standards, who do you trust? How do you check   that you are not being spammed by a porn site? The naked lady site put   every word in the dictionary in their meta info, the search engine doesn't   know the difference. Need digital signatures.  LK Let's come up with a bunch of RDF statements that we would like to see   put on the Web then decide what to do with them. The machinery for doing   stuff with this is being experimented with. Several inference engines   available none are Recommendation.  We can RDF statements that identify who said what. A machine searching out   the info could determine who asserts it.  Who said it?  Basis of what being said. In U.S.: WCAG, 508, Microsoft, ATT, etc.  Statement itself - we have AERT.  WL Before you go into doing that, look at the dublin core. They have 15   recognized things.  LK /* looking at the dublin core */ title, creator, subject, date, type,   format, identifier, source, language, relation, coverage, etc.  HB Some of those can be multiple.  LK Many of these have obvious uses.  WL Rather than reinvent the wheel, let's see what they mean by that. As you   get into it, then you can say, "this comes under that" We'll have to be   immersed in this since the tools will use it.  LK looking at just "title, creator, and subject" how would we use these?   I'm an evaluation tool, I don't look at the page, but what other   authorities have said about a page, then I draw a conclusion about the   page. Let's come up with examples of how these are used.  WL Has no alt-tags, alt contains the word ".gif".  LK How actually use.  WC Need for page level and element level.  LK A page where AFB has approved the alt-text, a deafness organization has   approved the captions in the movie, etc. Some statements will apply to   multiple elements.  WL We have lots of good ideas for how to use. But, XML is just 3 letters.   There is time to digest this.  LK I agree, but I'm trying to get some concrete examples for how to use   this stuff and what we're going to do about it. Are we going to define RDF   predicates that people can use?  HB In the latest Dublin Core they have added qualifiers (refinements) to   their elements. "for relation" "has part, is references by, format of, etc."  LK When I look at the Dublin Core elements, they instantly make sense when   I want to apply to a book or article, I am having trouble seeing how they   apply to what we're doing. I"m not saying they don't apply, but I don't   comprehend it yet.  WL We have a lot of studying to do.  LK Maybe we haven't assimilated the information well enough, but I   personally do not see how to apply.  WC Relationship.  HB Digital Talking Book using some, still in flux. Mostly SMIL.  LK In the expanded aspect, do these touch on internal aspects of a book?   chapters?  HB If a book has a narrator, who narrator specific chapters, commentary.  WL There will be concordances for War and Peace just as with Bible. You   better have a way to sift through it.  LK If an authority publishes a review of a web site or part of it, The   Dublin Core provides us with the way to publish the commentary. Creator,   Contributor. Commentator. You could have cross evaluation project to   evaluate web pages. This describes the commentary itself.  WL This whole vein is that a lot of the meta stuff appears within a   document, e.g., creator, date, etc. But it doesn't have to be. E.g. you can   comment on the Bible without having written it.  LK Does the Dublin Core have special terms for works that are reviews of   other works.  HB Don't believe so, no. "Is referenced by" and "references"  LK Are there various types of references?  WL You can create that on your own.  HB /* reads about references from dublin core */  LK Say there is a history book that uses HB's as a secondary source   material. Or I could review HB's book and reference it. At this point in   time, the dublin core does not distinguish between these references. I'm   reviewing or making use of.  HB There are further text to use.  LK A web site is a review, we have used the dublin core on the site   (contributors, date written, what referencing) it's referencing guidelines,   the document it is reviewing, etc. Then the insides of the web page is   making statements about the site. Like WL mentioned you can mention info   about each alt-tag. RDF does have a way to assign numbers. We would have to   define something new. But we could define something on a scale: poor,   somewhat poor, good, very good, etc.  WL There was a public relations debacle that happened with PICS. PICS tends   to be what we're looking for for evaluations.  LK Did they get into Dublin Core stuff?  HB It predated the Dublin Core.  LK For statements about individual elements, is it straightforward for   every checkpoint to be obviously converted to an RDF statement.  WL WCAG checkpoints?  LK Looking at AERT.  WC Schematron. Would be interesting to look at it and fill in what's   missing, e.g., is the alt-text accurate.  LK Looking at AERT, auditory descriptions...  WL When put it in, leave an audit trail that it is present.  LK Let's say, here is a page, it has a link to a real audio file. I want to   say, "there is a text description for this audio file." I've prepared it,   listened to the file, etc. I want to convert this to an RDF statement.   "has-audio-description" "name of the file" "yes/no"  HB I can't believe the Daisy folks felt they needed 43 additions to the   Dublin Core.  WL Somebody is saying the same thing you have said. They probably have not   heard back yet.  LK What are those?  HB format generator, multimedia type, front page, page normal, etc etc.  LK Language is in the original set.  HB This might be a translation from the original.  LK Of that list, which most offends?  HB They all deal with document itself, no chunking.  LK We have consensus that there are useful things in the Dublin Core.   Schematron is an initial cut at specific RDF statements. Question is: what   additional statements do we need?  LK Here is an HTML document, here is an element.  HB It has class= already.  LK We can embed the comment in the doc or put it in external.  HB Or add an attribute value pair to existing element for which our   commentary applies. CAST's Bobby puts something in new version of document   as a placeholding mark (with hats).  LK Are the Bobby hats intended to markup the document for machine-readable   tracking or just to communicate with the human.  HB Right now is informative to human. Used to link to more info.  LK Your talking about inserting new tag into new document. Say you have img   with alt-text. Are you saying you would add attribute value to image tag   itself?  HB That's one thought.  LK Another way?  HB XML comment convention. I would discourage it's use. Way to put in   non-visual.  LK <!-- -->? Adding meaning to comments. Don't like that.  HB Basically trying to define an audit trail. It can either be in source   document, where it can persist over revision or in concurrent document.  LK If in concurrent document, how does it make assertions about each element.  WL It's name contains something that that's what it is.  LK Here is an RDF doc, it says that a certain image lacks alt text. E.g.   you can think of various ways to point to an image. XPointer "It's the 3rd   child of 5th descendent" but what happens if someone asserts some material   in the page. Then you break that relationship.  WL The revised document doesn't check out again.  WC Unless editor keeps track of things being inserted.  LK Fine if the editor is keeping track, what if external? There would have   to be a diff between versions.  WC For image, could look at src.  LK There are heuristics. Sending diff to RDF to correct itself...  WL The way it was organized in the first place will dictate that. If   originally done by machine, can be done again.  LK What kinds of standards would we have to define? Ideally want a diff   tool that works on the DOM.  Action WL Start the basis of "What are the accessibility features of RDF"  Action WC: Check out schematron, how can we make it more precise?    Next f2f?  WL I could try to arrange something in San Fran in November.  LK Piggyback off of ASSETS and CUU? DC in November.  Action LK post links to ASSETS and CUU  WC Who do we know in DC who could host?  WL Government organizations. NIDDR, US Mint, GSA, etc.  LK Just a room?  WC room, A/V, breakfast, lunch.  HB AOL is in the area.  Action WC ask JB who she knows in the area that might be able to host.  HB Also XML 2000 in DC in early December.  WC I am presenting there.  Action LK post link to XML 2000 to the list.    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

        We received comments from the W3M (W3C Management) review of the   charter.  Two changes were required. I made them and republished the   charter at:  http://www.w3.org/2002/10/wcag-charter-draft.html  The WG needs to also approve the changes and then the charter should be   ready to move forward for consideration by the Advisory Committee    1.

The Working Group will continue to work on   the following deliverables:  ===    Now it says:  The WCAG WG has been working on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines   (WCAG) 2.0 since November 2000 and seeks to renew the charter to finish the   work. Addressing a breadth of technologies, reformulating the priority   scheme, and writing a suite of documents that meet the Requirements for   WCAG 2.0 has taken longer than anticipated. The Working Group will continue   to work on the following deliverables:  ===    2.  10.3 IPR, used to say:  W3C promotes an open working environment.

      Hello,    I have edited the charter [1] per today's discussion.  Here is an overview   of the edits:    1. 2nd point in mission statement now reads: "to find tools that implement   the techniques and where there are none, prototype or participate in the   development of an implementation;"    2. moved 4th point in mission statement  to the 3rd point. it now reads,   "to assess the implementation of these techniques in evaluation and repair   tools;"    3. the audience used to be listed as 3 bullet points. I converted it to a   definition list and expanded the description of tester. it now reads:  "Content authors, designers and developers  Role: develop and design Web sites.  Need: tools to help identify and fix accessiblity issues.    Users  Role: use Web sites.  Need: tools to transform inaccessible sites.    Testers  Role: evaluate Web sites for conformance. These include policy makers,   purchasers, managers, testers that are part of the Web site development   team.  In other words people who may either be external or internal to the   organization creating the site.  Need: tools to identify accessibility issues."    4. In the deliverable section, I added the following sentence to the   description of  Evaluation, Repair, and Transformation Tools for Web   Content Accessibility, "We will also evaluate which ERT techniques are   supported by which  tools."    Please send comments to the list by this Friday, 21 April.    thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello,  I am sending this on behalf of Tim Boland from NIST.  At the 4 March F2F he   took an action item to draft "Accessibility Testing Technical   Documentation." It is based on other W3C Test Suite work (primarily SVG,   CSS, and UAAG) and outlines possible requirements for a shared ATAG and   WCAG Test Suite.  We discussed this draft briefly at the 23 March joint   meeting between the ATAG WG and WCAG WG.  --wendy    >>>Attached is a draft of an accessibility testing technical document (WCAG   >>>action item due March 20).

      Possible Agenda Items  - presenting EARL to humans (RDF to XHTML via XSLT)  - EARL Primer  - Existing tools - redesign of page, new tools to add?  - AERT open issues, look for msgs from me  - next f2f    Participants: Katie, William, Wendy, Sean,    Summary of  discussion (detailed minutes follow):  - F2F in September sounds good.  One option is to look for a place in   Brighton.  Suggested that if people attending by phone that minutes be   taken in IRC.  Need a better phone system as well.    - It is not clear where this group is headed.  After we finish EARL, there   was discussion of merging with WCAG and AU, or providing support for those   groups in developing tools to help them get through CR with respective   advanced versions of their documents.    - Not clear how developers will include or refer to EARL since there isn't   a MIME type.  There is a possibility of using http headers with RIDL, but   that is not yet a standard and not clear if it will be   implemented.  Therefore, we talked about using comments within headers like   CSS and scripting use for backwards compatibility.    - SP talked about XWeb a new language he and Aaron Swartz are working   on.  The group is very interested in learning more, since it includes a   switch-like statement to associate multiple alternatives with a piece of   content.  SP needs to check with Aaron before releasing the URI to   everyone. Also discussed an article written with Murray Altheim.  SP needs   to send URI to article to the list. See summary below.    - WL wants an abstract of EARL to take to the DIWG.  He will summarize the   issues of the DIWG so someone can write an abstract that shows how EARL can   help with those issues.    - We briefly discussed if WCAG 2.0 would require machine-readable   assertions of the accessibility of the content.  So far the WCAG WG has   discussed granular assertions but have not gotten into detailed conformance   discussions as of yet.        ***Detailed minutes    Next F2F  WL Seattle in September  WC However, SP couldn't make it. Therefore, what if we went to SP?  (SP is in Brighton Sussex)  WL Make sure that minutes are in irc.  Need a better phone system -   everyone should be wearing headsets.    WC Focus of next F2F?  KHS Where is this group going? Purpose of ER?  WC Working on tools to help ATAG and WCAG get through CR.  Implementations   of EARL.  Need to do WART to show that it is "real."    SP Link EARL from XWeb. EARL doesn't have a MIME type.  WC Do annotations have MIME types?  SP RDF, not officially listed MIME type.  WCAG should be labeled for what   it is.  Namespaces help, if not XML rely on MIME types.  KHS possible to register?  SP Yes, need RDF registered first. SVG uses the +xml, we would need to use   +xml and +rdf.  WL What can we do to enable author to enable EARL declaration?  SP Http headers using RIDL.  Could define new types of content w/URIs.  WL what if you had a comment and code at beginning that made it something   you could use.  SP Like P3P labels and PICs. OR http-equiv attribute.  WL Kludges are perjorative, but the whole thing is a kludge. Legacy is   non-existent.  SP That's what they did for CSS in HTML, a comment.  WL I think there is some way to do it.  Put meta anywhere.  SP Serialze EARL in augmented meta data. Perhaps by qualifying some of the   types.  WL Idea of authors to make assertions is needed. Everything presumes a   certain set of baseline capabilities/system requirements. One assertion   that an author makes are the presumptions, e.g. you need IE7 to use this.    /* SP describes XWeb, a language that he and Aaron are writing.  It's a   modularization of HTML, true separation of presentation from   content.  Allows multiple alternatives for content.  Looked at using switch   statements to determine which alternative to use.  Packaging for reuse   between documents. SP has URI, but not sure Aaron wants to publish to   people yet.  We all encouraged SP to prod Aaron to publish URI.  SP said it   had only been in development for about a week.   Also talked about a note   with Murray Altheim re: modularization of XHTML, augmeta.  */    Action SP: send URI to list re: modularization of XHTML - augmeta.    WL Need an abstract of EARL to take to DIWG.    Action WL: summarize issues of DIWG and send to group so someone can write   abstract of EARL for DIWG.    WL Highlight things that make use or potentially make use of EARL.    SP Machine-readable assertions required in WCAG 2.0?    WC Not yet, have talked about granular assertions.

      Hi all,    Could someone give me an idea of which tools on the existing tools list [1]   have been reviewed by ER?    Which ones have been developed in conjunction with ER?    Which tools are people's favorites?  i.e., which ones do you think will be   best for a demonstration to the W3C Advisory Committee on November 3?

      Hello,    Thanks to Max and Eric for scribing.  Here are the minutes.  http://www.w3.org/2001/03/07-specProd.html    Specprod BOF notes - 27 Feb 2001  Present: Mark Nottigham, Yves Lafon, Eric Prud'hommeaux, Hugo Haas,   Philippe Le H?garet, Susan Lesh, Karl Dubost, Wendy Chisholm (chair), Ian   Jacobs, Dan Connoly, Charles McCathieNeville, Max Froumentin (scribe), Paul   Grosso, Norman Walsh, Jean-Fran?ois Abramatic (observer), music and beer.  Regrets: Eve Maler    Dan plays a blues riff    Susan: a bug in xmlspec produces all kinds of unnecessary tags when   converting to HTML. Default attribute values are inserted in the output,   like: rowspan="1", colspan="1".  Norm: That's a bug in the DTD.  ACTION (Norm): fix DTD and get Eve to use the cvs repository for xmlspec.    Dan: about the cvs repository, who has write access to the DTD and stylesheet?  Hugo: technically everybody.    Round The Table  Norm Walsh: maintaining the stylesheet and the DTD with Eve. One plan to   add markup to DTD to do XML element content.  Paul Grosso (Arbortext): worked with Norm on DTD, used it on fragment   interchange.  Eric Prud'hommeaux (W3C): sample application for me.  Mark Nottigham (Akamai): involved in IETF spec production and editing.   Interested in W3C stuff.  Yves Lafon (W3C): to know what is going on here. Will need for XML protocol .  Max Froumentin (W3C): was involved in the stylesheet. Been in touch with   folks who want to use the spec prod tools but don't know how to (which XML   editor to use, etc.)  Dan Connolly (W3C): been editing DAML spec - which is HTML jabber. Started   xspec prod list on a lark. Thinks XSLT is a great hammer to work with  Ian Jacobs (W3C): Worked on UAAG and HTML/CSS. UAAG in CR for 3 years.   Built up our knowledge in nasty perl hacks. Tried to go from HTML to   xmlspec prod. I hear folks wanting to start with HTML, not a custom DTD.  Dan: I'm not gonna invest in a DTD.  Wendy chisholm (W3C): co-editor of WCAG and some work on the perl scripts.   Now that we'ere starting UAAG 2.0 I'm looking at XSLT. Still deciding   between XHTML and a DTD.  Norm: so you migrated your spec to XHMTL to use XSLT to do what perl   scripts used to do a small bit.  Karl Dubost (W3C): conformance manager, interested in seeing better quality   in the specs and in translation issues.  Susan Lesh (W3C): proofread lots of specs in CR, PR and REC. Looked at   markup and found table markup bug. should get rid of tables.  Dan: more to contribute in style guides. We'll see  Charles McCathieNeville (W3C): staff contact for authoring tool guidelines.   Work from source html, final xhtml, generates toc, refs, multiple views of   the same source. go to my home page and look. Review lots of specs for   accessibility, did translations on Spanish. Work for WAI protocols and   formats group making sure the specs themselves are accessible.  Philippe Le H?garet (W3C): DOM wroking group, DOM WG products (spec, idl,   java/ecmascript code, text version) are completely written in XML (using   modified xmlspec DTD). not using XSLT, were using COST (by Joe English) for   DOM1. Rewrote everything in java using the DOM.  Hugo Haas (W3C): got involved when I was W3C webmaster, now staff contact   for xml protocols. Now working on publishing the first xml protocol   document. Thought xmlspec prod was cool. Noticed that ALT generated on tables.  Philippe: also summary on tables.  Paul: we need some amount of trust. Fixing the stylesheet is ok but we   should be conservative regarding the DTD.  Norm: but everybody will make their own version of it.    HTML or custom DTD?  Charles: lots of people use XHTML, they don't have a nice XML editing tool.   Want to make spec prod available to a larger group of editors but don't   want to teach them emacs. I want some kind of reasonable wysiwyg tool.  Dan: do they have HTML editors and no XML editors? Amaya is not accessible,   it doesn't run on mac.  Charles: runs on my mac wendy: how long do people want to go? agenda: ...   get from wendy ... chaals: propose shift accessibility (tools and docs) to   the list * votes for ...till 19:30 ietf production issyues ian's perl   scripts nroman, paul, chaals: vote for DTD issues chaals: editors and tools    Ian's perl scripts  Ian presents his perl scritps that have typed refs in the source (normative   vs. not), tools to insure that user refs are defined, tools to strip unused   refs, glossary. Dont have: calculating dependency graphs, generation of   spec package for offline reading, PS and PDF single HTML. No multi spelling   checks, duplicate words, tidy to produce XHMTL at the end all kinds of   scripts to generate cross-linking index and sub index generation same with   defined and instances. TOC, short and expanded, checklist of requirements   (but strips out comments) want spec to be proven, and more fornal methods.  ACTION Ian: send this to the list    Philippe's DOM scripts  PLH introduces DOM groups cool scripts: crosslink, glossary, references   don't have: normative and informative references, can't remove unused   references.  Dan: make sure all biblio is ref'd in spec  PLH: done in DOM  Dan: all normative refs must be checked closely  Paul: how do you know normative refs? xmlspec DTD should be changed to   reflect normative/non-normative refs.  Dan: editor writes it in the link...  Norm: I'm moving references to normative/informative section. and links are   made appropriately. I claim whether my refs to a spec is normative or not  Others: doesnt' work, depends on the link  Mark: I approached this by: whether a ref is normative is defined by ...  Charles: I make a normative and an informative link to a document.  PLH: we also generate an automatic index at the end, with links and glossary  Wendy: documented?  PLH, Ian: no.  ACTION on PLH and Ian to document this to the list.    Susan: doc for xmlspec says that dtd does not yet specify format for   reference entries (e.g. [1] or [XML]). Can we agree on what a reference   looks like?  ACTION: susanL - bring this up on the list?  Karl: are not too many cross links an indication of a poor quality?  Dan: the XML schema spec demonstrates this prob ...  Norm: people don't like the blue text of cross references, too distracting   when there are many of them in the text. e.g. XML schema part I. We want to   change a way to do examples and tables. How do we change the presentation?  DanC: submit it to peer pressure. I trust your judgement.  Wendy: xhtml vs DTD  Danc: we don't want to agree on this, people can choose.  Charles: less stuff to maintain (e.g. XSLT) if everybody does same.  Hugo: allowing html gives control over style. DTD is content only.  DanC: this is maximum constraint. people do want to change style.  Charles: would be cool to collectively use references between specs: same   glossary. The WAI glossary is shared between specs and accessed using xslt.  Paul: we want contents in the DTD not style. Norm can fix the style. No   need to tell the author not to mess up.  Dan: we can all do it in xhtml.  Paul: chaals said that with xhtml people can see that it looks like.  Chaals: with xhtml people can see what it looks like, especially using   editing tools.  Paul: we (Arbortext) have an xml editor, every platform but linux. Others   companies do it too, Frontpage is a bigger risk  Danc: can use tidy  Chaals: other tools like dreamweaver can roundtrip xhtml.    Mark on IETF  Canonical form is ascii text, header and footer on each page, line length   constraints. RFC editor will accept ascii text and nroff but big debate   currently about using html. Tools that evolved: word macros, nroff macros,   DTD described in RFC2369 with implementation in TCL that spits out nroff,   HTML, and ascii. Works reasonably well: TOC, references  SusanL: can you point to an RFC that does it right?  Mark: all do. Most people like it for production (no headers or footers).   Some private talk about tools to do process management and issue tracking,   some commonalities with W3C  ACTION: Mark to send summary to specprod.  Danc: if process management spans out, can you send mail to specprod?  Mark: wierd dtd has lots of presentation in it  Hugo: how does Reagle do his specs? reagles are spit out for W3C and IETF  Dan: probaly uses Jim Davi's html to generate markup/sgml./specprod text   from html.  Mark: you'll never get consensus in the ietf.  Mark: there is a schema version of the specprod DTD. I use henry's XSV.  Wendy: close  Other agenda items:  why doesn't DanC invest time in DTD development? (he made a comment as we   went around the table and Ian wanted to know more).  XHTML vs. XMLspec DTD - had some discussion on this, but could probably use   more.  Editors and tools - what are people using? Had a couple comments on this   but not complete (my request).  Translation issues (Karl's request).  Examples - instead of tables use pre or other (Susan's request)  Accessibility of spec-prod tools (Charles' request).  How to make changes to the spec-prod DTD. Discussed a bit, but don't   remember clear resolution (DanC's request).  Style guide - reference and how look (Susan's request)    Eric Prud'hommeaux, Max Froumentin    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello,    In trying to get the ERT published as a public working draft as issue has   come up with the title and the short name.    I had proposed that the short name (the unique URI identifier) for this   document be "ERT" as that is what we have been calling it within the   group.  However, other W3C folks felt that the short name needs to reflect   the title of the document.    Currently, the title is, "Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of   Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"  which is a real mouthful...    The proposal is that we change the title to something along the lines of:  main title: "Techniques for Evaluation and Repair Tools"  subtitle: "for conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"    thoughts? if we get this settled today it can still be published as a   public working draft this evening otherwise we wait until next week.    thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        >WL: I can't speak for W3C but I think the idea of us evaluating tools  >vs. reporting on individual's experience with them is out of bounds.    WC:  Will tool developers see a difference?   I know we talked about the   marketing advantages of the database and the incentive it may give   developers to make their tools conform to WAI guidelines.  I realize we   won't give anything a formal "WAI seal of approval" or "official evaluation   tool of the WAI" but if someone searches for Level A compliant tools they   will basically be finding those tools that we deem WAI conformant. In a   sense this is a seal of approval.    I still think this information is very useful.  I also still have my   concern that I expressed during the joint telecon on Tuesday.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Hello,    I'm playing with ETA, the W3C issue tracking tool.  I've added the 2 issues   raised during today's chat about the EARL 1.0 working draft.    http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/issuesList.php3/wai/ER/    Please send additional comments about the draft to the list.

        Hello,    Nick Gibbins published an earl strawman schema [1] during the F2F in June.  Since we almost have consensus about schema changes (SBP has some objections), I have been using Nick's schema to generate the next draft of an EARL 1.0 spec.  Has everyone had a chance to look at the strawman?      I compared the strawman to the 1.0 test schema [2].  What follows is a list of classes and properties not defined in the strawman and proposals for how to deal with them (or not). Assuming we move forward with the strawman,  I want to be sure we don't accidentally leave out something important.      Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of these proposals.    1. Severity (new)  At the F2F we had consensus that a severity property, similar to confidence and validity, would be a good thing.  I propose we add something to the strawman.  Refer to Ian's proposal: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Jun/0044.html    2. repairInfo, expectedResult, suspectAgainst (from 1.0 test)  These seem to be evaluation-and-repair-tool-specific and don't seem necessary to combine or compare results of tests.  No changes to the strawman proposed.    3.  operator, operatorInstructions, purpose (from 1.0 test)  These describe properties of the testCase.  Since we do not want EARL to be a pseudo-test description language, it makes sense to get rid of these.  One question: what if the operator is different from the assertor?  It seems the two could share the assertion. No changes to the strawman proposed.    4.  testMode (from 1.0 test)  testMode had 3 instances: automatic, heuristic, and manual.  One of the original features of the language was the ability to store information about how the testSubject was evaluated and who made the assertion.    We get at this somewhat with properties of Assertor, but this could be different information than the Assertor properties.  If not covered by Assertor properties, I propose we add something to the strawman.     5. TestCriteria,  suite, level, excludes (from 1.0 test)  While these describe pieces of the testCase, at the face to face we agreed that we need some way to group tests.  Suite, level, and excludes were created to do this.  I propose we add something to the strawman.  Ideas?      6. os, version (from 1.0 test)  Is this covered by platform.  It seems to me that these are necessary to uniquely identify user agent test subjects.  If not covered by platform, I propose we add something to the strawman.      7. snapshot  (from 1.0 test)  I think this was created to help deal with dynamic web content.  A snapshot could capture the content at the time of an evaluation. Is this handled by reprOf?  At this time, no changes proposed.    8. date  (from 1.0 test)  I believe SBP created an EARL-specific date datatype to deal with ambiguities in DC. Date is important in identifying "versions" of dynamic web content.  The strawman does not contain any constraints other than rdfs:range and rdfs:domain, whereas 0.95 and test1.0 had a variety of constraints (mostly daml).  Many folks felt that constraints was something to attempt in a future version after daml/oil/owl/other are stable.  Is creating a datatype for dates a similar issue?  Has this been dealt with someplace else (DC?) since earl:date was created?  I do not have a proposal one way or the other at this time.    I look forward to your comments.    --wendy    [1] http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~nmg/er-swad/earl-strawman.rdfs  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2002/06/earl1-schema.rdf    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Thank you for your comments and compliments, Steve.    I have a few questions and comments that are interspersed and marked with WC::    >  >"Resolve the relationship between user agent support and author supplied  >content (cross-platform and backwards compatibility issues)."  >  >Yes, extremely important.  >Does "author supplied content" include the role of authoring tools?    WC:: This is an interesting question.  I would say "yes" because the   majority of people creating content do not want to deal with pointy brackets.    >In short, I believe WCAG2 must include sufficient knowledge from the user  >agent and authoring tool accessibility guidelines as well.    WC::  What should we include from the ATAG and UAAG guidelines?  Could you   give me an example?    >And, of course, user agent = browser + assistive technology.  >Guidelines should carefully and clearly give guidance to the developer  >about:  >1. "What do I have to know about how the (user agent, authoring tool) does  >behind the scenes, how it works, in order to  produce accessible content?"  >2. when to ask 1, that is,  >"How do I know that my possible lack of knowledge  >of how user agents and authoring tools work may be influencing the degree  >to which my content is accesible?"    WC:: However, a large portion of people who are creating content for the   Web will not be technical.  Therefore, providing tests that they can   perform to determine if their content is accessible seems to be a less   ambiguous way to go.  I think this information might be more helpful to   people creating the tools that evaluate content for accessibility or that   create Web content (i.e. evaluation tools and authoring tools).  That   knowledge should be build into tools so that the author is not required to   learn that.    >      What I'm driving at here is that, in problem solving, it is important  >to know how and when  to break your problem down into simpler problems  >(finer grained detail) you can solve.  >If you are solving a really new problem, with no prior experience, you  >don't know ahead of time even what details need to be considerred in the  >first place.  >Guidance must be givenn.    WC:: Yes, we must give guidance, especially since some people will use a   text editor and the guidelines to create accessible content.    >(For a much better treatment of these issues, see George Polya's classic,  >"How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method".  I think Polya's  >detailed discussion of the problem solving process is worth reading for  >anyone creating what amounts to a domain specific problem solving manual.  >Especially useful are his example dialogs between teacher and student.)    WC:: Has someone provided a summary of this somewhere?  I can only find   references to buy the book (do you work for Amazon.com? <big grin>). How   long is the book?    >"XML technologies (DTD authoring? namespaces?)"  >  >Absolutely, essential, esp. considering  >issues raised in  >" XML Accessibility Guidelines", (  >W3C WAI PF draft note - 17 February 2000  >http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/xmlgl.htm)  >considering that there are a proliferating number of markup languages and  >as noted in the above,  >there is no accessibility built into XML itself (e.g. requirement for an  >alt attribute), are there any thoughts about modifying the XML spec itself  >to do this, (or will these be handled via style sheets?).    WC:: Yes, we will absolutely cover XML. The question is more about how to   incorporate the PF XML guidelines. What do we do about DTDs?   Namespaces?  The approach of these guidelines is currently very different   from the current WCAG 1.0 and we aren't sure right now how to fit them in.

Best,  --w    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/07/f2f-agenda.html      Tuesday, 1st July 2003    9:00 - 9:30 Introductions, Agenda setting  9:30 - 10:45  Plenary discussion      Possible topics:           - WCAG 2.0 Conformance           - Process comments from latest public Working Draft           - WCAG 2.0 messaging           - Migration from WCAG 1.0 to 2.0           - Testing for conformance to WCAG 2.0    10:45 - 11:00 Break  11:00 - 12:30 continue plenary discussion  12:30 - 1:30 Lunch will be provided  1:30 - 3:00  Break into groups of 3-4 people.  Discuss these questions in   your group and appoint one person who will summarize the discussion and   report to the rest of the group at the end of the day.  You don't have to   answer all of the questions, these are suggestions to get you   started.  Your group may also wish to discuss questions about WCAG 2.0 that   are not on this list.  The goal of this exercise is harvest ideas about   WCAG 1.0 adoption and usage and how that will influence WCAG 2.0 adoption   and usage.       Discussion questions:           How is WCAG 1.0 currently used in your organization or your country?           How do you think people in your organization or country would like   to see           WCAG 2.0 conformance structured?           How do you think 2.0 will be used?           What are the primary issues you face with WCAG1.0?           What have you heard about 2.0 (are people talking about it already)?           Are you familiar with ATAG?           What authoring, evaluation, and repair tools are you most familiar   with?           How do you or your organization currently test for Web accessibility?  3:00 - 3:15 Break  3:15 - 5:30   Plenary discussion     - reports from small groups     - agenda setting for Wednesday      Wednesday, 2nd July 2003    9:00 - 10:45  Plenary discussion       - continue with reports and discussion from small groups       - agenda setting  10:45 - 11:00 Break  11:00 - 12:30  break into groups of 3-4 people     Possible topics and work items:        - Continue discussion of questions from yesterday        - Techniques (semantic web, html, css, client-side scripting, svg, etc)        - Draft proposals to address open issues        - WCAG 2.0 messaging        - Migration from WCAG 1.0 to 2.0        - Testing for conformance to WCAG 2.0        - WCAG 2.0 implementation testing framework    12:30 - 1:30 Lunch will be provided  1:30 - 2:45  continue small group discussion  2:45 - 3:00 Break  3:00 - 4:30  Plenary discussion - reports and summaries from small groups  4:30-5:30  Planning and next steps    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--          

        New Chat Application Includes Accessibility Features for Users of Screen   Readers and Screen Magnifiers  Dagmar Amtmann, Ph. D., Assistant Director, UW Center for Technology and   Disability Studies  Debbie Cook, Director, Washington Assistive Technology Alliance  http://wata.org/pubs/bulletins/winter2003.htm#chat    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      At this a.m.'s telecon I was trying to find a site that I had seen earlier   in the week.  I have found out it was not a public site, so I will   summarize the issue that we found.    The site uses rollovers on menu items to display pictures.  For example,   "architecture" is associated with an image of an indoor swimming pool,   "industrial design" is associated with an image of a station wagon with the   back door open so that you can see into the back of the car, "interior   design" seems to be associated with a modern, shiny kitchen.    The issue is that the links on their own "architecture, industrial design,   and interior design" give you no context.  The images provide you with an   idea of what you might find if you follow the link.  In the text-only   version they only provide the links.    The question we asked this morning is, "how would you determine if these   two sites (the text equivalent and the graphical with rollovers) are   equivalent?"  They have the same links, but there is information presented   on the graphical page that is not available on the text-only.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Note: this is an issue for the next working group.  The charter for this   group ends in 2 weeks and before then we need to draft a new charter,   release another version of techniques (primarily a restructuring), and   close current open issues.    However, I suggest people check out the latest W3C Recommendations XPath   and XSLT.    <BLOCKQUOTE>  The World Wide Web Consortium announces two new Recommendations - XSL   Transformations (XSLT [1]) and XML Path Language (XPath[2]) - that will   enable the transformation and styled presentation of XML documents. "Anyone   using XML can now take advantage of XSLT, a powerful new tool for   manipulating, converting and styling documents, and XPath, a simple way of   referring to parts of an XML document." said Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director.   "Together, XSLT and XPath strike a fine balance between simplicity of use   and underlying power."  </BLOCKQUOTE>    The major theme of the WCAG is "graceful transformation" meaning that   content is separate from presentation  so that the user can control the   presentation whether it be on a cell phone, a handheld device, an auto pc,   etc.  Therefore, as gregory said, we need to address functional limitations.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath      At 01:09 AM 11/18/99 , Scott Luebking wrote:  >Hi, Gregory  >  >I'm not quite sure what to say about the issue of customized web pages.  >If the technology exists to let a user specify how the web pages should  >appear for such preferences as colors, layout, content, etc, why not  >allow for the page to be structured so that it easier to use also?  >  >I guess the first question I will go back to is whether the demo  >customized web page that I've put on the web has features which makes it  >easier to use?

        Thanks Jason. Carlos Velasco and William Loughborough  (on PF WG)   agree.  I've closed the issue as it relates to success criteria and expect   if it comes up it will be in a server-side techniques document.  --wendy    At 07:31 PM 10/22/02, Jason White wrote:        >On Tue, 22 Oct 2002, Wendy A Chisholm wrote:  >  > >  > > Hello,  > >  > > The WCAG WG has an open issue about protocols [1].

      Message summary:  This message grew more the longer I thought about it.  Reading an article   about Netscape 6 from WebReview.com [1] inspired me to compile some   statistics on browser usage [3].  One of the stickiest WCAG 1.0 issues we   have is the "until user agents" clause.  We don't have a clear answer to   apply to the WCAG 2.0 working draft yet.  Here's an attempt to gather some   information that might help.  I have sent this e-mail specifically to   several people on the GL list since I've included a list of questions about   usage in people's regions or work environments. Answers to these questions   might help us form a clearer picture of the technology that people with   disabilities use and if it is significantly different than the rest of the   population.  --w    WebReview published an article last week called, "Why Netscape 6 Woes Are   Your Best Friends" [1] by Makiko Itoh.  In it, he discusses some of the   bugs in Netscape 6 but also its conformance to W3C standards (DOM Level 1,   part of DOM Level 2, CSS1). Many previous Netscape proprietary document   objects are no longer supported, e.g. the layer and ilayer objects.  Refer   to WebReview's comparison chart (updated 14 January 2001) for more info on   CSS1 support [2].    He says, "Despite the frustrations of having to change the way we work, the   strict nature of a browser's adherence to standards makes sense. If there's   a certain level of core standards support in all major browsers, it makes   our jobs as Web designers and developers much easier, much less time   consuming, and more cost effective."    Netscape 6 is much less forgiving of invalid markup which should hopefully   force designers/developers to validate their code.  That push should help   accessibility quite a lot.    Perhaps one of our primary activities should be working to help people   worldwide to upgrade to IE5.5 on Windows, IE5 on the Mac, or Netscape 6 on   Linux/Unix/Win/Mac.  At least that might help solve some of the baseline   capabilities problems.  It's a dream but perhaps not so far off.    I talked with someone who recycles old computers to give to people with   disabilities.  I had assumed that this was his primary business and that   people with disabilities were spending money out of their own pockets to   buy assistive technology and computers.  Instead, he says most of the   people he works with here in Wisconsin (please don't generalize this too   much), get money for technology from the Department of Vocational   Rehabilitation.  Since they often spend $1000 or more for assistive   technology they are also getting brand new computers off the shelf.  He   receives more offers than he can handle for donations of old computers and   turns a lot of people away - the computers are too old and worthless (a 386   with a black and white monitor for example).  He says most of the people he   works with, if not all, will be using the computer to communicate (e-mail,   web, messaging, etc.).    I want to know what it is like elsewhere.  What are other people   experiencing in their part of the world? Anne (school environment for   children with learning disabilities - U.S.), Jim (school environment for   children with visual disabilities - U.S.), Claus (Denmark), Lisa (Israel),   Max (Japan), and Jason (Australia), Chuck (Canada) - as well as everyone   else -    What is happening to older computers?  Are they being recycled? Upgraded?   Trashed?  Which operating system(s) do you use at work?  In the schools in your   region?  Disability user groups in your region?  a. DOS b. Windows 3.1 or earlier  c. Windows 98/2000/Millenium d. Windows NT  e. Macintosh 7.1 or earlier  f. Macintosh 8 or later (Macintosh Be, MacOS)  g. Unix  h. Linux i. other - please specify.    Which browser(s) do you use at work? In the schools in your region?   Disability user groups in your region?  a. Microsoft IE 3.x or earlier  b. Netscape 3.x or earlier c. MSIE 4.x d.   MSIE 5.x  e. Netscape 4.x f. Netscape 6.  g. Mozilla  h. Opera 3.x  i.   Opera 4.x  j. Opera 5.x  i. IBM Home Page Reader j. PWWebSpeak  k. Other -   please specify.    Are there particularly agencies in your state or country that help people   with disabilities acquire technology?   How often are they able to   upgrade?   Are they encouraged to upgrade?   Are they given support to   answer questions or to help install new software?    How different is the technology in inner cities versus rural areas?  What connection speeds do people typically use?  Can someone provide information about Russia?  Africa? China? South   America? Other European countries? Other U.S. states?    I collected some data from a variety of sites and published some notes [3].    One interesting quote I stumbled upon is:  What browser are they using? "...it doesn't matter. What DOES matter is   that there are differing browsers with differing characteristics, and there   are LOTS of them already out there. Even if the best "selling" browser   changes, the chances of the majority of users converting to that browser   within a short period of time are very slim. Even if the percentage of   users drops lower, 25% of 276+ million is a respectable figure - around 80   million."    As of October 2000 Internet.com had several accesses by Microsoft IE  1.x   as well as Netscape 1.x. They also report that about 83% of access requests   include Javascript support for Javascript 1.2, 1% were for JavaScript less   than 1.2, and 15% did not support Javascript or had it turned off (is my   interpretation of "Javascript false" although it might mean not supported   rather than turned off).    Most stats show a clear lead of Microsoft over Netscape over   other.  however, the breakdowns vary.  An even larger variance is shown   just in support for IE5. Note that it is not always clear if they are   reporting IE5.x, IE5.0, or other.  So i have included how they report it as   well as the date that they reported it.  31.7% WebSnapShot.com (IE5.0 22 January 2001)  81% WebSnapShot.com (IE5 20 January 2001 as reported by Browser News)  32% How Big is the Internet (MSIE5 24 May 2000)  66% The Counter (MSIE5.x - 20 October 2000)  73% The Counter (MSIE5 20 January 2001  as reported by Browser News)  67% My WebSite (MSIE5 20 January 2001 as reported by Browser News)    I think this info might be useful as we try to tackle the baseline   capabilities/until user agents discussions.  I will continue to add to this   summary. Please send info and links that you would like included in this   summary.  I'll be interested to read people's responses to my questions above.

It is my   interpretation of sifting through the archives that if the "desired effect"   is a space between two characters, using an image for this is   inappropriate.  We suggest style sheets.    Also, some people have favored "" while others like " ".  Most of the   arguments have been based on the current state of the art handling of   spaces.  However, it appears that "" and " " are currently handled the same   [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/spaces.html].  I was the only one to   respond to the tests, so it only includes the 3 browsers I was able to test.    Many people pointed to the HTML4 spec where it says that "leading or   trailing spaces" may be ignored.  However, is a single space trailing or   leading?        is inappropriate since it is intended to be used as a typesetting   hint as Nir described on 17 November:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec/0070.html  Alan Flavell also makes a good point about nbsp not being considered "white   space" http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec/0069.html    Therefore, I don't think it matters much if we suggest that people use ""   or " ".  Personally, it seems to be a matter of author preference.  Neither   one is going to cause horrible things to happen (although "" has   historically - i.e. it supposedly used to be ignored by Lynx but doesn't   seem to be anymore).    If we look at the long term, I would suggest using a space since spaces are   supposed to be preserved in XML.  However, I also agree that it is a matter   of separating content from presentation.  A space seems to say, "there is   formatting going on here" while null says, "it's decorative."    Again, I think it boils down to author preference.    >3d. If the image is decorative, use alt="" but ask if the author would like  >to associate a longdesc  I think it is up to the author, thus why I left it as either a blank or a   short description.  It is my understanding that some users appreciate   knowing what is on the page. If the author wants to support short   descriptions for them, it is their choice.    As we look forwards to tools that will allow users to navigate the   structure of a page, if a user chooses to navigate past images then we   won't have to worry as much about users wading through alt-text that they   don't care about.    Therefore, I once again include a proposal for review:  <proposal>  1. Flag images with:  * the IMG attribute alt="", alt=" ", and alt=" " (or alt=" ")  * OBJECT (of type="image/gif" or "image/png" etc.) that has no text content.  (Note that OBJECTs of other types should be handled elsewhere in the ERT   document.)    2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., <a   href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=" ">Refer to our home page</a>)   this is o.k.    2a. if the link does not have text, look for other links on the same page   that point to the same URI and use the text from those.    2b. If no other links to the URI are found on the page, prompt the author   for text to be included as a text equivalent of the image (or if the author   wants to add it as text of the link.)    3. If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the   image.    3a. If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those   words should not be separated, advise them to use   (or alt=" ")   instead of an image.    3b. If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text,   advise them to use style sheets, IMG alt=" ", alt="", or spaces in the   content of OBJECT.    3c. If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to   provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary a longer description.    3d. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of   the page, advise them to provide either brief descriptive text, or that   they handle it as a "space" (see 3b), and suggest that they may also want   to provide a longer description of the image (on IMG with the "longdesc"   attribute or as text in the content of OBJECT).    Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style   sheets, such as graphical list bullets. Advise authors to use style sheets.   (See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document).  </proposal>    --wendy    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    The ER working group is creating techniques that evaluation and repair   tools can use to determine or help the author determine if elements on a   Web page conform to WCAG 1.0.  [1]    One technique is, "Verify that the page is usable when programmatic objects   are disabled."  This means that it must first identify programmatic   objects.  We had assumed that we could identify which OBJECT elements   included programmatic objects by looking at the "type" or "codetype"   attribute.  However, there is not a type defined for Java or Flash in the   current list of MIME types [2]. I had expected to find a subcategory of   application for Java and flash.    Should this be taken to the HTML working group?  Have we overlooked something?    Perhaps we should say that OBJECTs with type="application/*" are potential   programmatic objects?  We don't want to limit it only to Java and flash,   but I expect a lot of what we'll be seeing is Java or flash and if we know   that is what we have we could suggest specific techniques for those   technologies.    Thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/  [2] ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        If you would like the WCAG WG to discuss a specific issue,    1. check if the issue is already in the issues list  links to condensed bug report lists:   http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/  we have 4 open issues related to client-side scripting:  http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/clientside_issues.php    2.  If your issue is not on the issues list  create a new issue in the WCAG Bugzilla database  http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/    3. Propose a solution to the issue and send it to the mailing list  For example, refer to this message from Michael Cooper about using the   summary attribute on Table elements.  He summarizes the possibilities and   proposes a   solution.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0294.html    Another good example:  summarize the issue and raise questions that we need to answer about a   particular technique:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003AprJun/0215.html    ===  While scripting issues have not been the core of our discussions, we have   been making progress. Here is an overview of what's been happening with   Techniques for WCAG 2.0 (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20.html#techs).    1. updating issues lists.  all previous HTML issues have been moved to bugzilla    2. discussing open issues on Wednesday telecons and mailing list  primarily addressing HTML issues, summary of those discussed in the last   few weeks:  - tables  - alt/title/longdesc  - abbr/acronym    3. designing schema and tools for techniques  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/sources/xmlspec-tech.dtd    4. converting old html techniques to new dtd  Loretta is doing this.

      After thinking about this more, we could discuss the following techniques   that would help determine if a page is accessible to someone with low vision:    1. how to determine if an image has text. if it does have text suggest that   the text become the alt-text, perhaps also suggest that the author use   style sheets.    2. check the page for high contrast color combinations - see the color   study done by the ATRC in Toronto for more info.   http://snow.utoronto.ca/readtest    3. check images for high contrast color combinations - this requires   determining the colors used in the image.    4. I'm not sure what automated technique to suggest for this one: 2.1   Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without   color, for example from context or markup.

      Note that under Principle 1 there are a couple of paragraphs.  The first I   thought helped to clarify the principle, the second is an alternative wording.    There is also some clarification with Principle 2.    Part of this is to address Ian's comments about responsibilities, it is   also partly to help clarify what is meant in the short Principle statement.    Principles 3 through 5 do not have clarifications.    --w  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Authoring Tool WG (AUWG),  Web Content WG (WCAG WG),  and WAI IG,    The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERWG) has been working on   the Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines [1].  This document describes techniques that Web   accessibility validation tools may use to evaluate the conformance of HTML   documents to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0). This   document also describes techniques that Web authoring tools may use to help   authors modify HTML documents to conform to WCAG 1.0. We anticipate that   tool developers may develop accessibility validation and/or repair modules   to be incorporated into commercial authoring tools, validation tools, and   perhaps user agents.    The ERWG believes this document is ready to be published as a public   working draft, but would like comments from AUWG, WCAG WG, and WAI IG   before moving forward.  This document still needs work - thus it is a   working draft.  You will notice several double at-signs (@@) throughout the   document which mark open issues, questions, and other to-do's.  There is   also a list of to-do's at the beginning of the document.  We would   appreciate comments on these as well as any other comments that you may have.    This review period will end Thursday, April 6 2000.  Please send review   comments before that date to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org.  Archives for this list   are at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/.

      If there is not a specific proposal to change the guidelines, then this   thread is not productive and should stop.

      Despite some of the reactions about the stats collection that I posted the   other day [1], I'm still curious and will continue to add to it.  <humor><img src="wendy.jpg" alt="wendy gives everyone the raspberries"></humor>    Today's addition:  results of a bot that crawled the sites on the Media   Metrix Top 500 site last summer to determine which technologies they   employed.  Results are:  79.9% of the sites use Tables  62.0% use JavaScript  38.2% use Imagemaps  20.6% use Style sheets  2.1% use ActiveX  1.1% use Java    That's likely a lot of tables used for positioning.    This data is from The Client-Side Conundrum by Ray Valdes (August 2000, Web   Techniques)    BTW - Currently, the browser usage and demographic stats that are listed in   my collection are only for desktop users with some info on WebTV users, I'm   anxious to collect info about mobile devices.    FYI - I'm not actively pursuing this info but keep running into it and   decided to document what I've run into - lest you worry that this exercise   draws from my attention to the WCAG 2.0 work (although I think it's related).

      Yes, that would be the best approach.    Also, I stand corrected.  Each of these appendicies is linked to at least   once.  Appendix A is actually linked to 3 times.  Therefore, I think we   ought to keep Appendix A, the Appendix on identifying bullets and the   Appendix on identifying horizontal rules, but incorporate the rest back in   with the techniques that refer to them.    And, i think we should do that   by pointing to examples as Chris suggested.    --wendy    At 03:21 PM 8/22/00 , Chris Ridpath wrote:  > > The others are placeholders to discuss placeholder information (ironic  > > <grin>).

      Hello,    I have published a new draft of the techniques document   [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000309/].  The revisions are   minor.  I realized that I didn't have enough information from the group to   move forwards with restructuring it in a way that would satisfy everyone's   needs.  Therefore, I hope we will talk about this more at today's   call.  Particularly, Tim's comments from 21 February   [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JanMar/0263.html]    The revisions I did make:  1. I updated the "status of this document"  2. added links to the HTML and CSS modules at the top of the main   techniques document. (there are now 3 links one to the contents of the main   techniques doc, one to the HTML doc, and one to the CSS doc).  3.  included checkpoint text in the HTML module where it says, "Checkpoints   in this section."  previously it was only the checkpoint number.  the   checkpoint number is the link and the entire text of the checkpoint is   included after it.  i only did this in HTML techniques because I wanted to   see if i was on the right track.    I still have the rest of charles' comments from 15 february to finish   [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JanMar/0244.html].   These are mostly editorial, but there are a few that warrant further   discussion.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        >  >A and AREA elements that have a HREF attribute should also have a HREFLANG  >attribute. Valid values must be in the IANA registry (we have info about  >that somewhere else).    13.1 is a priority 2, but the checkpoint to identify the language of a   document (4.3) is a priority 3.  Identifying changes in language within   text (4.1) is a Priority 1.    I think this is most like Checkpoint 4.3 but fits best as a technique under   13.1 but with priority 3 rather than 2.    However, we have already agreed that the Technique priority is inherited   from the checkpoint priority.  Perhaps we should revisit that   resolution?  or is this actually a priority 2 Technique?    Plus, I think this is a user agent issue.    >This brings to mind another technique that I thought I added to my  >submission over the weekend but must have been tired and forgot. We should  >also check for the TYPE attribute of A and AREA elements, wich identifies  >the MIME type, i.e., _computer_ "language", of the target. The advantage of  >this would be users (with browser support) would know not to follow links to  >images or whatever that put them in dead space.    hmm, again I think this is a user agent issue.  The resource that is being   retrieved should identify itself.  For example, today I can tell Netscape,   MSIE, and Opera not to load Java or scripts.    Your example, where I don't load an image because it will put me in "dead   space" is interesting to consider.  If I have said not to load images, but   I follow a link that bring up an image, then what will the browser do?  I created a test file to find out:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/image.html    I turned off images in both Opera 3.6 and MSIE 5.  When I followed the   link, both browsers did the same thing - showed the image.  I guess what   else can they do?  There is no alt-text associated with it...    In the user agent guidelines, this is a priority 3:  <blockquote>  8.4 Make available to the user information that will help the user decide   whether to follow a link. [Priority 3]  Note. Useful information includes: whether the link designates an internal   or external anchor, the type of the target resource, the length and size of   an audio or video clip that will be started, and the expected natural   language of target resource.  </blockquote>  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128/    This takes me back to the discussion above....    Looking at 13.1 in WCAG again, using "title" is suggested, kind of like a   P3.  There actually seem to be 2 checkpoints here:  WCAG 13.1 - Clearly identify the target of each link [Priority 2]  WCAG 13.1a - Provide supplemental information to help users determine if   they want to follow the link. [Priority 3]  This includes: language of the   resource, type of resource, size of resource, etc.    Therefore, I propose that we take this issue to WCAG WG.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      <wendy> nick - is there still a way to get static output from page valet?  <wendy> while stepping through the errors is cool, there's not a good way to skim through them.  <wendy> i thought the "document view" link would give me that, but it just described the different views.  [18:48] <nick_kew> hi wendy.  [18:48] <nick_kew> just a mo  [18:49] <nick_kew> Use the "messages+source" view - though I may have broken it yesterday  <wendy> hmmm. tried that. i'll try again.  [18:51] <nick_kew> It's under development; not really satisfactory even if I didn't break it  <wendy> trying again...get the page view and have to tab through messages.  [18:55] <nick_kew> OK, yes, I did break it  [18:55] <nick_kew> Try again now  [18:57] <nick_kew> (the "highlight" links require javascript to work well - without it they just go to the element but don't highlight it)  [19:05] <nick_kew> sbp, have you seen FillyJonk?  <wendy> hmmm. i have javascript, but nothing is highlighted....  [19:06] <nick_kew> It might be out of the window you can see.  Click a second time  <wendy> you've taken the WCAG errors out of the main source and put them along the left side?  [19:06] <nick_kew> Yep  <wendy> ah. i see what's happening. why move them out? i liked them in w/the other errors. :) found it much easier to read.  [19:07] *** JibberJim (~Jim@bh-cw32-152.pool.dircon.co.uk) has joined #er  [19:07] <nick_kew> Well, the default document view puts them inline  [19:08] <JibberJim> Hi, apologies for being late - my dodgy cable!  [19:08] <nick_kew> hi  <wendy> ah - ok. was that broken before also? i thought i tried that.  [19:09] <nick_kew> No, that was fine.  That's always been the "primary" mode of use  <wendy> I still find the WCAG1, WCAG2 confusing.  [19:09] <nick_kew> In the messages?  [19:10] <sbp> <nick_kew> sbp, have you seen FillyJonk?  [19:10] <sbp> of course - I was in #validator when you guys were testing it  <wendy> I see the issue w/expressing confidence as "WCAG1/High" or "WACG2/Low"  Seems to be 2 priority levels not one for priority and one for confidence.  [19:10] <nick_kew> Ah, of course...  <wendy> nick - yes WCAG1, WCAG2 in the messages.  It makes it seem like WCAG version number rather than priority level.  <wendy> we all seem to be here...already discussing Nick's questions...continue on with that?  [19:11] <JibberJim> I want some advice from you sean on how to present the result of EARL queries in an understanable form in IRC, then I could add in some EARL querying to FillyJonk (it's valuable as it's all javascript I'd re-use in other scripts.)  [19:11] <nick_kew> Maybe I can change them to WCAG:A, etc?  [19:13] <sbp> Jim: Hmm... I'd represent them as N3 of course, which was designed for scribbling down RDF in environments such as this  [19:14] <JibberJim> How easy is triples to N3 ?  [19:14] <sbp> but OTOH I use N3 for everything, so you have to take that cum grano salis  [19:14] <sbp> triples to N3: very easy  [19:14] <sbp> if you can spew them out as XML RDF, you can surely do it as N3  [19:15] <JibberJim> I'll look at that then tomorrow...  [19:15] <nick_kew> Wendy, is it any better now?  [19:17] <JibberJim> Do we have an Agenda?  <wendy> yes agenda posted to the list today.  * wendy digs for uri  <wendy> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Feb/0019.html  [19:18] <JibberJim> I was too busy moaning about the "tonight" :-)  <wendy> nick - it's interesting to use A, AA...I understand it. wonder how other people will do with it.  <wendy> we've discussed some of nick's questions.  <wendy> shall we continue on with that then get to Jim's?  <wendy> I sent the agenda to Marja, EriP, and Ralph w/the hopes that one of them might show up for the chat.  [19:19] *** Masaya (~ando@210.255.84.226) has joined #er  <wendy> no luck, it seems. although, i did chat for a while yesterday w/marja and i'll be at MIT in a couple weeks and we'll work more on this stuff.  <wendy> Welcome Masaya!  [19:19] <nick_kew> Wendy, my main question now is to discuss how well these confidences work  [19:19] <Masaya> Hello  [19:19] <nick_kew> hi  <wendy> Everyone - Masaya is working on the J-WAS project - an evaluation tool in Japanese.  [19:20] <Masaya> I am Masaya from Tokyo  <wendy> They are considering implementing EARL.  <wendy> Masaya - we are discussing Nick's tool called PageValet at:  [19:20] <JibberJim> That's good the more developers the better.  [19:20] <JibberJim> Hello Masaya.  <wendy> http://valet.webthing.com/page/  [19:20] <Masaya> hi  [19:21] <Masaya> ok... I will see...  <wendy> Nick - you are wondering about the confidences - you mean e.g. "WCAG-A:High" or "WCAG-AA:Low"?  [19:21] <nick_kew> Well, two things   [19:22] <nick_kew> firstly the High/Low/etc values  [19:22] <nick_kew> secondly how best to express them (needs an explanation page, too)  [19:23] * sbp waves to Masaya  <wendy> with WCAG-A/Low you are saying it passes with low confidence or fails w/low confidence?  [19:23] <JibberJim> I'd really like numbers rather than high low etc.  <wendy> oh, I guess fail, eh?  [19:24] <nick_kew> Yes.  All the messages are saying "possible fail"  <wendy> Can you be more explicit in the message? something like: Fails but needs human testing - Priority 1 WCAG checkpoint: blah blah blah"  [19:24] <sbp> the inclusion of "-" is interesting; perfectly uncertain fail == pass  [19:25] <nick_kew> sbp, yes, that's because there were two null tests in Section508, and I put in the messages for legalistic completeness  [19:25] <nick_kew> (i.e. so as to test the checkpoint)  <wendy> or: Possible failure - please confirm. WCAG Priority 1 checkpoint blah blah blah...  [19:26] <nick_kew> wendy, I'm trying to avoid verbosity.  These reports are already long!  <wendy> 7 extra words is too long eh?  [19:27] <nick_kew> I've seen pages generate >500 messages.  500*7 is a lot  <wendy> what about: Fails, Possibly fails, Uncertain failure - or something like that?  <wendy> as 3 diff levels?  [19:28] <nick_kew> Well,  [19:28] <nick_kew> I think the ideal thing would be a visual cue in CSS  [19:29] <nick_kew> the words are just a fallback  <wendy> what if you give someone a choice of viz cue, text, viz cue+text?  <wendy> (3 separate choices)  <wendy> jim - you prefer numbers? what kind of numbers?  [19:30] <JibberJim> it's XML (or RDF) - we have a choice already...  [19:30] <nick_kew> Ug - lots of stylesheets to maintain  [19:31] <JibberJim> for confidence of EARL predictions, I'd prefer it if we could use numbers rather than just high low...  <wendy> e.g.?  [19:31] <nick_kew> Jim, I'm already worried about my assignments.  With percentages it becomes even harder  [19:32] <JibberJim> valet says pass confidence 60% - Snork says pass confidence 70% - then we can combine the two easily and with appropriate rating on how well the different tools assess that checkpoint.  <wendy> re:css - then i think the default ought to be viz cue+text  <wendy> how do you determine the percentage?  [19:33] <nick_kew> Jim, you need an extra link in there: how much do you weight each of two tools  [19:33] <JibberJim> That depends on the tool, for high/low/definate we can just have 100/66/33 or whatever.  <wendy> e.g. provide an accessible alternative to script elements. if there isn't noscript, then what percentage confidence can you provide?  [19:33] <JibberJim> that's a user issue Nick depending on how you use the two reports.  [19:34] <JibberJim> I'd say that's high for code not authored by about 3 people in the world, low for the other 3...  [19:34] <nick_kew> wendy, I take that as low confidence because <script> often has no accessibility problems, even without noscript (it may not be doing anything critical in the first place)  <wendy> do we really need more than 2 levels? e.g. can we just say "passes" or "fails"?  [19:35] <nick_kew> No, because Valet can't be sure in many cases  [19:35] <nick_kew> e.g. the script on Jim's page  <wendy> right. so passes, fails, not sure.  [19:36] <nick_kew> But I'm using a finer-grained notsure.  <wendy> do you need to? what benefit does the user get?   <wendy> if i have a list of things I know failed, i'll focus on those.  <wendy> if i have a list of things that might have failed with low certainty, i might ignore.  <wendy> if i have a list of things that might have failed with high certainty, does that say much more to me than those w/low certainty?  [19:37] <JibberJim> I (and many users) would rebel against tools which told me my accessible (by human judegement) page fails.  [19:38] <nick_kew> I think it's important that the user can see which messages mean "that's probably wrong", and which ones mean "probably OK, but you might want to check"  [19:38] <nick_kew> Jim, do you think Valet's "probably ..." approach will work?  <wendy> jim - i'm not saying that the page should say "you fail" i absolutely agree we need the human to check and make the final decision.  [19:39] <JibberJim> For humans in isolation yes, for combining I'd convert them to numbers in any case.  <wendy> will you have an interface that let's the user make assertions? e.g. valet says this one might fail, but i've tested and determined it doesn't.  [19:40] <nick_kew> Also it's not saying this is[n't] accessible; it's saying this does[n't] pass some test suite  <wendy> then valet could update the report?  [19:40] <nick_kew> Wendy, yes, but that's some time away  [19:40] <JibberJim> I think that's related to my agenda item in any case...  [19:41] <nick_kew> That's where EARL becomes more useful ...  <wendy> exactly - one of the main reasons for it.  [19:41] <nick_kew> HTML includes <link rel="accessibility" href="earlstuff.rdf">  <wendy> so, nick, whatcha gonna do? :)  [19:42] <nick_kew> Valet reads assertions, and applies them.  And provides an interface for the user to generate the assertions  [19:42] <nick_kew> But .. lots of work before it does all that  [19:43] <nick_kew> Jim - your agenda item:  Are you ahead of me on this one?  [19:43] <JibberJim> I would hope so, but I need some help :-)  [19:44] <nick_kew> From me?  [19:45] <JibberJim> Nope, From someone who knows about RDF databases and has a server to run them on...  [19:45] <JibberJim> That is unless Annotea is already a solution.  [19:45] <nick_kew> [mumble] .. another thing on the neverending todo list  [19:46] <nick_kew> wendy, can you find an annotea expert to tell us what it can do for us?  <wendy> i tried to get marja, ralph, or eric here today...  <wendy> i was able to get annotations from jim's page using amaya the other day. very cool.  [19:47] <nick_kew> I can't get amaya to work :-(  <wendy> at all?  <wendy> that's surprising.  [19:48] <nick_kew> Well, it can view one or two pages before crashing  <wendy> what version?   [19:48] <JibberJim> Eric describes a general RDF database at http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/0505-perl-RDF-lib/ which I assume could be used to store EARL easily, however the examples aren't clear.  <wendy> re: rdf databases, sean, isn't libby a person we could talk with about that?  [19:48] <sbp> indeed  <wendy> jim - is your issue that you want to store only rdf and not w/any annotea wrapper?  [19:49] <sbp> and Sandro et al. All of the rdf-rules community  [19:49] <nick_kew> amaya 5.2  <wendy> do you know if any of them is around to pull into our chat right now? or perhaps i ought to schedule a time for them for next week...  [19:49] <JibberJim> The Annotea wrapper seems to make it useless - I can't make any queries on it.  <wendy> why not?  [19:50] <JibberJim> Because Algae which use to query the annotea - doesn't look inside the annotation.  <wendy> ah - thus why i was downloading the annotation/earl to view rather than amaya displaying it to me?  [19:50] <JibberJim> That's related certainly.  <wendy> so, is that a problem with the algae implementation or the annotea idea?  <wendy> if it's the imp, then talk with ericp. if not, try to set up our own rdf database?  <wendy> i think an earl-only database would be good for several reasons...  [19:51] <JibberJim> I think the annotea idea (with respect to EARL), but I don't know for sure that it couldn't be changed - I prefer the EARL own though, and see that as a easier solution in any case.  <wendy> primarily so that clients wouldnt have to speak "annotations"  [19:51] <nick_kew> I downloaded an rdf-on-mysql thingey - possibly from annotea  <wendy> athough if they did, we could combine data from both.  <wendy> are any of you planning to attend the w3c technical plenary?  [19:52] <JibberJim> We could have our EARL RDF database store Annotations aswell, they are just RDF after all - it would just need more intelligent clients.  [19:53] <nick_kew> On the TBD list is to see if I can port it to pgsql so I can run it with valet  <wendy> is the annotations database just rdf? if so...couldn't we store earl there?  <wendy> seemed to me that eric was saying something about a very generic store  <wendy> so that no matter how the annotations evolved they could store anything there.  [19:54] <nick_kew> I think it claims to be just rdf  [19:54] <JibberJim> I believe it can yes, but if you chuck EARL at it directly it just complains.  <wendy> sounds like we ought to talk w/eric p.  [19:54] <JibberJim> the Annotea server doesn't understand anything but Annotea, but underneath the database does.  [19:55] <nick_kew> Jim, what's your database at the moment?  [19:55] <JibberJim> For the old earl client?  [19:55] <nick_kew> yep  [19:55] <JibberJim> A sort of hacked together mysql tables.  [19:56] <JibberJim> It's not good enough and needs replacing.  <wendy> http://www.w3.org/1999/02/26-modules/User/RdfSQL-HOWTO.html  <wendy> "The Annotations server is a narrow shim on top of the RDF database.  <wendy> "  [19:57] <nick_kew> http://www.w3.org/1999/02/26-modules/User/RdfSQL-HOWTO.html  [19:58] <nick_kew> oh, .. blush  [19:58] <nick_kew> That's the one I'd like to port to pgsql  <wendy> ah.  [19:59] <JibberJim> I should really be able to get it going, but I dislike perl so would have to port the "shim"...  <wendy> instead of perl, what would you use?  [20:00] <JibberJim> I also don't really have a server for it :-(  [20:00] <JibberJim> javascript of course...  <wendy> check out: http://web1.guha.com/rdfdb/  <wendy> uses perl...although someone did a port to java...how do you like java?  [20:02] <JibberJim> I prefer perl wendy...  <wendy> jim's order of pref: javascript, perl, java  [20:02] <JibberJim> with about a million dots between perl and java  [20:03] <JibberJim> porting the shim is probably not to hard, I could even use perl for any difficult bits.  [20:03] <JibberJim> I couldn't make the server widely available currently though through lack of bandwidth resourced.  [20:03] <JibberJim> What do people want from an EARL database in any case?  [20:04] *** SeanP (~sean@m48-mp1-cvx4c.pop.ntl.com) has joined #er  <wendy> check out all the apps: http://www.ilrt.bristol.ac.uk/discovery/rdf/resources/#sec-apps  [20:05] <nick_kew> Well, the kind of usage I was describing earlier will be for intranet users.  Too heavy to put up in public, esppecially with the overhead of securing it  <wendy> rdf query in javascript: http://www.w3.org/1999/11/11-WWWProposal/rdfqdemo.html  [20:06] <JibberJim> that's been kind of superceded by http://jibbering.com/earl/rdfquery4.html - but mine doesn't have documentation.  <wendy> cool  [20:07] *** sbp has quit IRC (Ping timeout)  <wendy> well, the point is...there are lots of resources for creating rdf databases.  <wendy> but, you ask a good point - what do we want to do w/it.  [20:07] *** SeanP is now known as sbp  <wendy> what i want:  [20:08] <nick_kew> but how mature/robust are they?  <wendy> a place where multiple tools can store and/or retrieve earl data.  <wendy> whether it be for a search, a repair, or an evaluation.  <wendy> then query it depending on the app.  [20:08] <JibberJim> I think we should research them Nick, and move on to what to do with it.  [20:09] <JibberJim> Do you log evaluations Nick? could you easily send all to a database - either live or in batch mode?  [20:10] <nick_kew> The only evaluations that go into a database are the manual ones (the user feedback form)  [20:10] <nick_kew> - and those from the site monitoring service  [20:11] <nick_kew> NOT from the developer tools like Page Valet  <wendy> could they? (the ones from page valet go to a db)?  [20:12] <nick_kew> Yes.  But I don't have the resources to do that on my poor little server  [20:12] <JibberJim> Than should be easy to create Wendy, all we need is a server, if we could get Eric interested in creating I'd've thought the server could be up in very little time - then I could easily build some Mozilla/IE based clients.  <wendy> cool.  [20:13] <JibberJim> Can you get Eric on board for that?  <wendy> i'll try, yes.  [20:13] <JibberJim> How about a server for it - is that feasible?  [20:14] *** SeanP (~sean@m4-mp1-cvx4c.pop.ntl.com) has joined #er  [20:14] <nick_kew> [we assume W3C has more server horsepower than we do]  [20:15] * JibberJim is more concerned about the bandwidth for the ones at his disposal  [20:15] <nick_kew> - that too:-)  [20:15] <nick_kew> Mind you, I could upgrade my server and bandwidth easily, if someone paid  [20:17] <JibberJim> Is there anything in Seans 1.0doc ? didn't you have a new "suspectsomethingorother" in valet Nick?  [20:18] <nick_kew> That was before I implemented confidence levels  [20:19] <nick_kew> (btw, sbp's spec defines High/Medium/Low for them)  [20:19] *** sbp has quit IRC (Ping timeout)  [20:20] *** SeanP is now known as sbp  [20:20] <sbp> [[[  [20:20] <sbp> earl:ConfidenceLevel a rdfs:Class; rdfs:label "ConfidenceLevel";   [20:20] <sbp>    is rdf:type of earl:Certain, earl:Likely, earl:Unlikely .  [20:20] <sbp> ]]]  [20:20] <sbp> - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Feb/att-0007/01-1.0.n3  [20:20] <JibberJim> Sean seems to be having problems..  [20:20] <sbp> indeed  [20:20] <nick_kew> I think [high|medium|low] come from an earlier draft  [20:20] <sbp> yes, from 0.95  [20:21] <JibberJim> Can we not have a choice of types?  [20:21] <sbp> is there any consensus on the range of levels needed? Jim asks for a numberic value, Nick now uses an extend range...  [20:21] <sbp> choice: of course. it's not a strict enumeration  [20:22] <JibberJim> so RDF:type means what - it could be this, but?  [20:22] <nick_kew> Numeric (eg percentage) values would be the most flexible  [20:23] <nick_kew> but I'd just be using them as synonyms for high/low/etc  [20:23] <sbp> the earl:confidence links a validity property to its confidence i EARL  [20:25] <nick_kew> Jim, would percentages suit you, even if they were just used as synonyms for something more fuzzy?  [20:25] <JibberJim> Of course, I don't mind how some tool gets to the %  [20:26] <JibberJim> I just would like when I'm combining 3 evaluations combine them with different weights and thus make a more true comparison.  <wendy> then why don't we use weights? 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low?  <wendy> how would you combine them?  [20:26] <nick_kew> Right.  But the way I'm working, that translates to  <wendy> if report one=1, report 2=3, and report 2=3 - do you take the average?  [20:27] <nick_kew> Wendy, that's exactly what I do now: it's just that the weights have names  <wendy> get a confidence level of 2.3  [20:28] <nick_kew> enum { Test::Low = 1, Test::Medium=2 , ... } confLevel ;  [20:28] <JibberJim> An average yes if all tools were equal but if one was Bobby and one was page valet, I'd want to give page valet a higher weight, and if one was human I'd do even more) this could mean I could get a rating of 1.5 where would that go?  [20:28] <nick_kew> could scale those up and call them percentages  <wendy> i'd like to see these clearly defined.   <wendy> e.g. when does a low-high become a medium?  <wendy> e.g. 2.3 - is that a medium? or low?  [20:29] <nick_kew> Use Bayesian or neo-bayesian logic  [20:29] <JibberJim> Exactly so if we have %'s we don't need to worry we just give them the % and the tool decides...  <wendy> i want some clean, testable rules! :)  [20:29] <nick_kew> (I'm using something more akin to a Dempster-Shafer belief function)  <wendy> what if the human wants to decide? e.g. - 3 tools said you pass and one said you might fail.  <wendy> instead of "you pass with 70% certainty"  <wendy> although, that could be helpful, too.  [20:30] <nick_kew> Jim, have you worked much with frameworks like this that combine evidences?  [20:31] <JibberJim> No.  [20:31] <JibberJim> I did a little a long time ago, but then I was never paying attention at Uni in any case...  [20:31] <nick_kew> I have, and it's harder than it looks to get sensible results out  [20:32] <JibberJim> I'd still like it to be possible, but can always implement it over the top.  [20:32] <JibberJim> high/low etc. do map to numbers without problem.  [20:32] <nick_kew> (when I did speech recognition research we had an evidence-combination engine, but it never outperformed an old-fashioned neural net)  [20:33] <nick_kew> - and the research money ran out just as we were in a position to start getting some really interesting results  * wendy searches for rdf projects that combine results...  [20:34] <nick_kew> OK, this is a much easier problem than speech recognition, but nevertheless...  [20:36] <nick_kew> Jim, I'm kind-of thinking a human evaluator will be allowed to assert things with 100% certainty and overrule anything a tool says  [20:36] <JibberJim> Of course!  <wendy> i agree.  <wendy> although, what about some people who might not feel comfortable and want a second opinion?  <wendy> i don't think we should rule out uncertainty by humans.  [20:37] <nick_kew> And that brings us to #2: what happens when the [human+tool(s)} gets it wrong?  [20:38] <nick_kew> - the need for a feedback system, where other humans can submit well-structured problem reports  <wendy> i wonder how amazon and the IMDB rate user feedback?  <wendy> ah duh, the user submits a subjective rating on a scale.  [20:38] <nick_kew> I mean user feedback dealing specifically with accessibility  <wendy> so, maybe some sort of scale is the best way...  [20:39] <nick_kew> wendy, yes, humans can assert uncertain things too!  [20:39] <sbp> { ?x earl:asserts [ rdf:subject ?y; rdf:predicate [ earl:confidence [ earl:pc ?pc1 ] ]; rdf:object ?z ] .

[20:40] <sbp> in the RDF spec? the RDF spec talks about graphs, and what happens when you merge them. you just combine the graphs  [20:40] <nick_kew> and then that assertion would NOT override the tool, though it will of course modify the overall belief state  [20:41] <sbp> [conjunctively]  [20:42] <nick_kew> RDF can say two arcs go between the same nodes (different assertors assert assertions on the same subject+object)  [20:42] *** JJ (~Jim@bh-cw31-059.pool.dircon.co.uk) has joined #er  [20:42] <nick_kew> but it's up to the tool to reduce that to a single {arc|assertion} and combine confidence levels  [20:43] <sbp> indeed  [20:44] <sbp> s/quotient/quotientOf/  <wendy> sbp - mind if i do some editing on the EARL 1.0 spec?

      my 2 bits....    Charles,  It seems to me that some of the terms that you suggest are similar to those already defined in ATAG.  For example, I think "information conveyed by a document" and "Information provided by an element" are trying to get at the intent and purpose of including those elements.  The purpose is based on how the user perceives and/or uses the contents of the element or its attributes. Perhaps reusing "rendered content" is the most efficient approach (rather than selecting new phrases to use).    I really like what is in ATAG and propose we inherit some of those definitions in WCAG, at least as a starting point to see how they fit.    >  Content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts. Phrases  >  such as "content type", "text content", and "language of content" refer  >  to this usage. When used in this sense, the term content encompasses  >  equivalent alternatives.

Some other thoughts:    element content - The text or other elements contained between the opening  tag and the closing tag of an element in an XML or XML-like language.  (this is specific to one selected element)    content - 1. a collection of element content, i.e. every node in the tree.  2. an individual node of the tree that has can been rendered in some medium.  3. content is information intended to be presented to the user or controls that the user will interact with.    rendered content - content that has been rendered in some medium for the purposes of user interaction.    Therefore, the distinction is that we have individual nodes and we have the collection of nodes.  I see the individual nodes being called "element content" and the collection as "the content."   I see this as being synch with the beginning of the ATAG definition where it states, "Content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts."    "Document" only seems to apply if the collection of nodes makes a document; some of these collections will be applications rather than documents.  I know it refers to the "document object" and therefore all of the nodes. It has confused readers in the past, leading them to believe we are only talking about documents and not including applications. Therefore, I hope we can be careful in the usage of the word "document" (i.e. be consistent with DOM definitions but also keep in mind the possible confusion it has for readers).    --wendy    At 08:01 AM 1/21/02, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Good topic...  >  >There are several uses of content in play.  >  >One is "element content" in the strict XML sense - the stuff between an  >opening tag and its closing tag, which may include elements (e.g. for the  >content of an HTML head element it is required for validity to include a  >title element)  >  >Another is the information contained in an element, which will include  >attribute values.

        Hello,    I apologize that this agenda was not posted 24 hours before the   meeting.  We will hold a meeting at our regularly scheduled time (later   today): 4:00 to 5:30 PM ET (which is 20 hours UTC/GMT).    More information about the meeting and phone bridge is available at [0].    There are items from the 7 August agenda [1] that we have not discussed yet.    This week, there a mailing list discussion and various proposals for   checkpoint 4.1.

        Hello,    On the mailing list, we have had some discussion about numbering success   criteria [1].  Jason, Gregg, Ben, and I were editing the next draft and   came up with the following proposal.    If each guideline was identified by a letter (e.g., "N" for "Navigable")   rather than a number (3) and if each conformance letter was identified by a   letter (M for Minimum, S for Second Level, T for Third Level), then each   success criterion could have a unique identifier (e.g., N3M1, N3M2, N3S1).    For example, the current checkpoint 3.4 with the proposed scheme:  Checkpoint N4 Provide consistent and predictable responses to user actions.    Success criteria    You will have successfully met Checkpoint N4 at the Minimum Level if:     N4M1. where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential          to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure          games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them.     N4M2. wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the following         is true:         a. an easy to find setting, that persists for the site visit, is   provided             for the user to deactivate processes or features that cause             extreme changes in context or         b. extreme changes in context are identified before they occur             so the user can determine if they wish to proceed or so they             can be prepared for the change    At the Second Level:       N4S1. the content has been reviewed, and it has been found that where         inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential to its         function (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.),         the user is warned in advance of encountering them    At the Third Level:    (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  ===    Pros and Cons:     - Should sound better for screen reader users since there are not        multiple numbers that are read in a row and the numbers follow        the letters.     - Creates a unique identifier for each success criterion.     - Might be harder to decipher the checkpoints.     - Is not consistent with WCAG 1.0, ATAG 1.0, or UAAG 1.0       numbering schemes.     - However, since it is different and since some people need to       conform to both WCAG and ATAG or WCAG and UAAG,       they are less likely to confuse ATAG/UAAG checkpoint 3.4       with WCAG 2.0 checkpoint N4.     - Not sure that it help distinguish our conformance levels from        those of WCAG 1.0 (Level A, Level AA, Level AAA) and        the priority scheme (priority 1, 2, 3).  Although, we did make        a minor change: previous "Level 2" is "Second Level"        and "Level 3" is "Third Level."    Discussion questions:     1. Is this easier or harder to decipher than the previous proposals?         i.e., 1.1.1.1 or 1.1-1a ?     2. Is it a benefit that this is different from the WCAG/ATAG/UAAG 1.0         numbering scheme or will it cause confusion?     3. Our preliminary tests showed this was better for screen          reader users.  Do you agree or disagree?     4. Other issues or comments about this proposal?    We discussed some other possibilities but discarded those because:  1. we wanted to associate the checkpoint with the guideline in some way to   preserve the grouping (thus we didn't want to assign a unique number to   each checkpoint).  2. we wanted to make something that would not be garbled by a screen reader   (1.1.-1a was read as "one one one ah" instead of "one one one A").

      Hello,    I finally got around to updating the issues list [1] per our telecon on   Monday [2].  I've been going through a few more and here are my   conclusions. We can include this as a brief discussion on Monday's telecon.    One thing that I did different from the decision on Monday, was put #17 as   an issue for xtech rather than ATAG.  It's requesting a definition of   multimedia which seems to go more with xtech than atag.    Here are the other changes i've made:    #20 Allow user to change the units of measure.  a new technique for ATAG-TECHS, therefore ATAG issue.    #22 Check document for missing quote markup  Moved to WCAG [HTML Tech] since need guidance on use of <Q>. There was a   thread in January 2001, but I don't think any resolution.    #23. ABBR values should be shorter than 15 characters.  Moved to ATAG.  This is describing a possible technique for identifying   abbreviations and if they are pronounceable.  Looks like a someday pile and   not something critical.    #25. Testing embedded technologies  Moved to ATAG.    #26. Server-side to client-side image map conversion  Moved to ATAG.    #27. Logical tab order  Closed.    #31. Provide general information about a site  Moved to ATAG    #43. Priorities for techniques based on level of heuristics  closed.    #44. HTTP headers - check for refresh?  Uncertain of the issue.  Does anyone remember this one?  William? you   raised the question.  LK took an action item, but I don't see any   follow-up.  Should we consider this closed?    #47. Checking A elements for valid text content  closed    #48. Checking for quoted text  Moved to ATAG.    #50. Suggested repair for updating equivalents of dynamic content  Moved to [WCAG Scripting Tech]. Although this is a discussion about   repairing dynamic content, I think the definition of what it takes to be   equivalent needs to come from WCAG.    #51. Identifying OBJECTs  Moved to ATAG    #52. Checking for device independent event handlers  Moved to WCAG [Scripting Tech]    #53-60 - didn't get to yet.    --wendy  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/07/09-minutes.html    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

        Wording ala the 08 January 2003 draft [1]    Comment #1a  Aaron Leventhal, 07 Oct 2002 [2]  Add to Benefits: physically disabled users that cannot use pointing devices   or speech input. For example, users with ALS who use single switches to   simulate keystrokes.    Comment #1b  WWAAC (via David Poulson and Colette Nicolle) , 4 Nov 2002 [3]  Benefits: The illustrated benefit is probably not such a good example as   speech input is only appropriate in a limited number of cases. A better   example would be that keyboard mapping for functions allows specialist   switch input devices to work with the applications    Proposal #1  Add a 3rd benefit: Individuals who are physically disabled and cannot use   pointing devices or speech input can have access to the functionality of   the Web content or site.    ==============  Comment #2a  WWAAC (via David Poulson and Colette Nicolle) , 4 Nov 2002 [3]  minimum level success criteria #: Could be made clearer i.e. user agents   and event handlers may be too technical for some readers. Checkpoint 2.1 is   particularly difficult to follow.    Comment #2b  Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 [4]  Suggest rewording "Minimum Level" to "content uses only event handlers that   are designed so that, at a minimum, they are operable through character   input." The current wording can be interpreted as meaning an event handler   can not also support mouse input (i.e. that it must be a keyboard event   handler only).    Proposal #2a  event handlers are designed so that they are not tied to a specific input   device (i.e., "device independent").    Note: refer to checkpoint 5.3 for information regarding support in user tools.    Proposal #2b  event handlers are designed so that they are not tied to a specific input   device (i.e., "device independent").  The user must be able to interact with the content either  - through a pointing device such as a mouse or a stylus or  - through the keyboard or  - through keyboard emulation.    Note: refer to checkpoint 5.3 for information regarding support in user tools.    Rationale #2  I am toying with the idea of "user requirements" attached to each success   criterion that explain *why* this criterion is important.  In other words,   tie each success criterion back to a user need.  It might make each   criterion too much and is likely redundant with the benefits (so they could   be collapsed)...not sure I like it, but thought I'd give it a try.  A   couple comments suggested we have more why/how info related to each checkpoint.    ============  Comment #3  Terry Thompson, 21 Oct 2002 [5]  Maybe what confuses me here is the prepositional phrase on the end ("to the   content or user agent"). Is it necessary? What else would a user be   providing character input into other than the content, user agent, or both?   As I think about it though, I'm confused by this entire checkpoint. Is this   not placing an emphasis on character-accessibility over mouse   accessibility? Why not "device-independence"?    Proposal #3a  Ensure that all of the functionality is operable via a variety of types of   input device.    Proposal #3b  Ensure that all of the functionality is not tied to a particular type of   input device.    ============  Comment #4a  Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 [4]  Level 2: what is a "more abstract event"? Same question applies if the   wording for this should be "more abstract event handler".    Comment #4b  SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002 [8]  level 2 #1: This item is not clear as currently worded and needs rewording.   Does it mean to use device- independent event handlers? If so, say that   instead. Otherwise, clarify. What is a "more abstract event"? "Used" how?    Proposal #4  Delete this criterion.  If they satisfy the minimum level criterion, it is   not likely there will more that they can do...i.e., if they have already   created something device independent, then creating something *even more*   device independent is likely just to confuse people more than inspire them.    ============  Comment #5  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [6]  The Character input definition refers to a character set called the W3C   Character Model. Are the tab and arrow keys part of this character set?   link to where this character model is defined.    Proposal #5  If proposal #2 is accepted, then we would not need to rely on "character   input."  For reference, W3C Working Draft: Character Model for the World   Wide Web 1.0 [7] does not include tab, alt, or other keys that might be on   a keyboard.  The model only refers to text strings (per my ignorant   understanding of the model).    --  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20030108.html#device-indie-events  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0023.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0135.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0111.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0080.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0117.html  [7] http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/  [8] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0130.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      There seem to be good overlap between our latest draft and theirs .  We   ought to be sure to keep these issues, checkpoints, and guidelines in mind   as we move forward with our revision.    Internationalization Guidelines 1.0  23 May 2000  This version:  Editor:  Sujatha N. Marsden, eTranslate    Abstract  This specification provides guidelines to content developers in developing  content with internationalization in mind.  These guidelines explain  some general issues to take into consideration while working on   internationalizing  anything on the web.  This would help in easily moving the content  from one locale into another without much hassle.    This document is a part of a series of internationlization documents  published by W3C (To be written yet)    http://www.w3.org/International/Group/2000/05/i18n-guide-20000523.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Hello,    This is to let you know that a reorganization proposal is available for   your review.    This reorganization is by no means a silver bullet to solve all of the   issues we are facing; I wish it were.  Instead, it tries to:  1. demonstrate the clarity gained by moving best practices and additional   notes to a separate document (NOTE: a mock-up of "gateway to techniques" is   not provided as part of this proposal. we did not have time to complete this.).  2. demonstrate that no requirements are lost by moving best practices and   additional notes to a separate document.  3. suggest rewrites.  in some cases we propose a new checkpoint or success   criteria; in other cases we propose combining two checkpoints into one or   separating one checkpoint into two.  4. identify testability issues, ambiguities, and unclear phrases.  in some   cases we suggest proposed text.    We acknowledge that there are issues with this draft.  For example, we   combined checkpoint 1.4 (core) and 3.2 (extended) into a single extended   checkpoint (3.2).  We have reasons for doing this but are not convinced   that this is the best approach;  we hope to stimulate discussion.  We hope   that the proposal, with its faults, will be considered a step forward and a   useful framework to discuss the issues already on the table.    Other issues and comments:  1. As with the July review draft, the introduction has been omitted so that   the focus is on checkpoints and success criteria.  2. We moved definitions from within the checkpoints to a glossary at the   end of the document.  Even though in the xml each glossary item has a   unique id, those ids are not present when the document is transformed to   HTML.  In checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2 we wanted to demonstrate linking to   definitions instead of providing them in the checkpoint.  Because the   glossary items do not have ids, the links to them (from the checkpoints)   are broken.    The 3 drafts:    1. the "clean" draft  does not show any editorial notes nor does it show any edits.  we hope this   gives people a sense of how the document could look after it has been   "cleaned up."  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/09/06-reorg-proposal.html    2. draft with editorial notes  throughout the draft we use editorial notes (marked "CKW:") to highlight   issues and provide rationale.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/09/06-reorg-proposal-with-ednotes.html    3. draft that shows deletions and additions  we wanted to show which content we propose deleting or changing as well as   provide rationale for each suggestion. again, we used editorial notes   marked "CKW:" to provide rationale but they are displayed visually with   strike-through and might be difficult to read.  note that we moved all of   the definitions from the checkpoints to the glossary but did not mark these   sections as deleted or moved.  (NOTE: While the two other drafts validate   as XHTML1 transitional, this draft does not.  I did not have time to fix   all of the nesting errors related to using the diff attribute in xml to   mark changes.  Not because I don't know how to fix it, but I ran out of time.)  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/09/06-reorg-proposal-edits-visible.html    Best,  --wendy for Cynthia and Kerstin.

        Hello,    As suggested last week, let's chat tomorrow (Thursday, 19 December) at 6:00   PM UTC  (Thu 10:00 AM Seattle, Thu 1:00 PM Boston, Thu 6:00 PM London, Fri 5:00 AM   Melbourne).    This will be an irc-only chat.  irc server: irc.w3.org  port: 6665  channel: #er    Per the summary from last week's chat [1], the issues to discuss tomorrow   are those that we did not discuss last week:    3. operator, operatorInstructions, purpose.  Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    5. TestCriteria,  suite, level, excludes.  OPEN ISSUE.  This had some support but some felt it was going too far in the direction  of a test point description language.    6. os, version. OPEN ISSUE.  We agreed there is no unique way to identify a UA (i.e., URIs for each UA  don't exist).  Although, the reprOf proposal from last week's discussion might  handle this issue.    8. date.  TO DO.  I have an action item from last week to do some research.    Best,  --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Dec/0015.html      --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--        

      Al,    You suggest that the WCAG group needs to be asked for clarification on this   issue.  You also state that this is not in alignment with what was decided   in a discussion with UA.    WCAG had a joint meeting with UA on how to markup "navaids" as you call   them.  It was my interpretation of that discussion that MAP ought to be   used.  I sent a proposal to the WCAG working group a while back and added   what was agreed upon to the HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0.    What I have proposed for the AERT is merely an extension of that   proposal.  No where did I hear that the UA/WCAG agreed that a title on a   container element was enough.  MAP needed to be used to contain the   navigation bar links.    Note that I am not proposing that <em>all</em> links be enclosed in   MAP.  Is that where the confusion is stemming from?  I am only referring to   links that are used as "navaids."  Thus, it is up to the user interface to   help the author decide if the identified group of links is a navigation   bar-type thing or not.  If it is, then the proposed AERT technique would be   invoked.    If there has been further resolution within the UA group (re: only using   "title" on containers of navigation bars) I do not believe that either WCAG   or ER has been made aware of these resolutions.    I disagree that what AERT needs to state is what is currently in the   ATAG-TECHS.  All that the ATAG-TECHS says is " Ask authors if lists of   links are a group and should be a map. "  The whole point of AERT is to   provide algorithms sans interface descriptions of actions an evaluation   and/or repair tool should perform.  Otherwise, there is no need for AERT   and we can keep it all in ATAG-TECHS.    Note that the main point of this message is to determine what should be in   AERT and what should be in ATAG-TECHS and how they ought to link to each   other and WCAG and WCAG-TECHS.    The actual proposal for technique 13.6.1 is included in another message   [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Jul/0026.html].   Please refer to that thread.  The text in this thread is what currently   exists.  note that it has changed significantly.    --wendy    At 12:25 PM 7/17/00 , Al Gilman wrote:  >At 10:48 AM 2000-07-17 -0400, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  > >Actually I may partially disagree I think (but we may just be matching  > >terminologies here) - the following are first response thoughts...  > >  > >The map element identifies the semantic of a collection of links.

Provide text with timecodes that is classified as either caption or   video description.  this information can then be synchronized and   synthesized to speech, synchronized as captions, or collated into a   collated text transcript.    Keep in mind that for people who are deaf and blind, the combination of   both the captions and the text of the descriptive video (a "collated text   transcript") is their only means of accessing the information.    --wendy  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>

      As per the discussion of the 13 January 200 telecon [1], I have updated the   errata to reflect Gregg's suggestion.    item 6 now reads:  <blockquote>  6. Placement of labels for form controls.  Added: 23 November 1999.  Modified: 20 January 2000.  Type: Error  Refers to: Checkpoint 10.2 in 5 May 1999 version.  Description (and correction).

        Hello everyone,    The first EARL 1.0 Working Draft was published   today.  http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/    Please read and comment on the various "Editor's notes" throughout the draft.    There is still work to do before this can be published as a W3C   Note.   Looking back at the questions and issues that were raised in august   [1]:    1. severity  Not incorporated into the schema but used as an example extension.    2. repairInfo, expectedResult, suspectAgainst.  Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    3. operator, operatorInstructions, purpose.  Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    4. testmode  Had support and was included as a class, a property, and instances of the   property.    5. TestCriteria,  suite, level, excludes.  OPEN ISSUE.  This had some support but some felt it was going too far in the direction   of a test point description language.    6. os, version. OPEN ISSUE.  We agreed there is no unique way to identify a UA (i.e., URIs for each UA   don't exist).  Thus, I still think these are needed to help uniquely   identify UAs.    7. snapshot.  Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    8. date.  TO DO.  Agreed to use DC:date, but it's not explained in the spec nor is there any   representation in the schema.    9. Uniquely identifying pieces of content. OPEN ISSUE.  The draft says nothing about how to handle changes to content identified by   an xpath that changes and breaks the xpath.  I still think this is   something that needs to handled separately (i.e., i don't think we want to   propose a solution in the EARL 1.0 spec itself) I do think we need to raise   awareness of the problem and pose possible solutions  (e.g., 1. if a repair tool: add a unique id to each element you annotate,  OR 2. use hashes to help determine what changed,  OR 3. if interactive: ask the user to confirm that the element being   referred to is correct, etc etc).    I would like to send a request for review to the RDFIG, the annotations   list (www-annotation), and the QAWG.  Are  there other groups that we ought   to send this to?    Thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Aug/0007.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--        

        IRC log: http://www.w3.org/2003/10/22-wai-wcag-irc.html    Techniques Gateway issues list:  http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php    Issue 518:  http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#518  consensus from last week: let's try to find accessible resources. where we   can't find an accessible resource, we'll send the site a message that tells   them they are not accessible and explain that we would like to link to them   but are working on an accessibility project.  thus, we will favor   accessible resources over inaccessible ones and encourage inaccessible ones   to become accessible.  If unable to find an accessible resource (or one   that is willing to become accessible) should we will link to it but warn   the user before they go there?    Issue 519  http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#519  resolution: create checklist items for each technique is techniques   gateway. link to these from (throughout) html techinques, i.e.   mini-checklists embedded in html techniques that link to techniques gateway.    Issue 524  http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/condensedreports/core_issues.php#524  resolution: we'll put technology-specific information for techniques that   don't have techniques docs of their own in an appendix in techniques   gateway. but - will cross that bridge when come to it.

      it makes the relationships clear!  nice work.  I particularly like the   furry animal representing the open issue w/dates (at least that's what i'm   assuming...)    If you've used Graphviz, isn't that the product from AT&T that can generate   SVG?

      In the UA face-to-face we identified that you may submit a form   inadvertently by using "return" with an AT that handles that key   specially.

        Hello,    Meeting details at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-agenda.html    best,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      I think this document is really coming along!  Lots of good info.    A few comments:    the title "How Different Disabilities Affect Access to the Web"  might be   easier to read as, "How access to the Web is affected by different   disabilities."    There seem to be some formatting errors.  I don't think the bullets under a   few of the disabilities should be  highlighted. For example, the bullets   following "Barriers that people with blindness may encounter on the Web   include:" are bolded.    "Alternate keyboards or switches" needs to include people with cognitive,   or neurological disabilities as well as a couple other types of keyboards   like so:  Hardware or software devices, used by people with physical, cognitive, or   neurological disabilities, that provide an alternate way of creating   keystrokes that appear to come from the standard keyboard. Examples include   on-screen keyboards, eyegaze keyboards, large key keyboards, symbolic   keyboards and sip-and-puff switches. Applications that can be operated   entirely from the standard keyboard , with no mouse movements required,   support single-switch access or access via alternative keyboards.    In the description of "Scanning Software" do we need to be more specific   about the different types of scanning?  The "cross-hair" method doesn't   seem to fit in this definition, although it *could*.  By cross-hair I mean   the kind where you have a horizontal line that moves down the screen (like   RJ Cooper's crossScanner).  when you press a switch, it stops and a   vertical line then starts moving left to right until you press the switch   again.  The item selected is the one at the intersection of the two   lines.  There are also other methods that I am less familiar with.    In the scenarios..    I suggest at least one scenario for each time of assistive technology   used.  Currently there are no scenarios for alternative keyboards,   switches, or scanning software.  I think just one more scenario would be   good.    this sentence is a little hard to understand: "She uses the speech output   for rapid review of the text in a document, and has become accustomed to   listening to the speech output at a speed that her co-workers cannot   understand at all."  perhaps, "has become accustomed to listening to speech at a speed so fast   that her co workers can not understand it at all."  ??    "Suddenly Kam finds that he has no idea what up to half of the   instructional material is about, and his performance in the class starts to   slip." might be easier to read as "Suddenly Kam finds that he has no idea   what most of the instructional material is about, and his performance in   the class starts to slip."    "Then she sends the URI of the virtual tour to friends, to see if they   share her interest in trying a particularly good-looking new restaurant   downtown that weekend."  use "interesting sounding" instead of "good-looking."        

      Hello all,    We don't have a meeting 10 Sept.  Our next meeting will be 17 Sept.    Until then,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      The IRC log for the technical review was not very good.  However, here are the basic bits that I was able to collect or recollect.  We spent most of our time discussing the first 3 issues that I raised.  I quickly summarized the other issues, with minor discussion about issues with XPointer.      1. Identifying Resource State Changes  http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/12/13-EARL-techreview/slide16-0.html    it was suggested that we check out how XML Signatures deals with the issue. i.e. fingerprints  http://www.w3.org/Signature/    Another option (instead of hash) was "shingles" (suggested by Eric Miller). Shingles give different weights to different structural parts of a document. e.g., you might want to pay more attention to images than to other parts of content (w.r.t. accessibility).  If you want to know HOW content changes, this is more an area of research. Shingles are just one mechanism.   http://www8.org/w8-papers/4c-server/mirror/mirror.html  http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/articles/199707/cluster.html    However, when we discussed Nick's hash hack in more detail, they seemed to agree this was the easiest and best method to use. It is more similar to what dsig does.  If we have further questions, Joseph Reagle is willing to discuss this with us in more detail.    Another idea (from danbri) "to define XSLTs that strip textual content from XHTML docs, then run hash over the result. This would let us check for structural changes in a doc, ignoring edits to prose"     2. Combining and Querying Results   http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/12/13-EARL-techreview/slide17-0.html   The overall feeling was that it is up to the implementation.  Issues raised were those of trust and conflicts.     - Does the user using the tool decide the level of trust?   - How do you merge conflicting assertions?    3. Identifying Evaluation State Changes  http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/12/13-EARL-techreview/slide18-0.html   We discussed how it is up to the implementation to do a few things based on convenience for the user.  For example, if someone wants to see the history, they should be able to.  However, they might not always want to see the history so sometimes it ought to be hidden.    Marja, Ralph, and Eric were on the phone, so we had a brief discussion about annotations.  Marja said, that there could be different types of replies, such as 'I disagree', 'I make this obsolete'  Some types of replies are pre-defined, but obsolete is not one of them.       We agreed to have more discussions with the annotea folks.    When I asked if we should add "supersedes" or "replaces" or other values to handle relationships,   there was a strong reaction against adding anything "just in case."  http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt  http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/early.html      Questions for consideration:  1. A few complicating issues: content and language negotiation; they may or may not affect accessibility evaluations.   2. CC/PP provides small schema of info on resources. If people buy into RDF, then should buy into re-use, and should check out CC/PP predicates.  Is CC/PP dependency with EARL accepted? The big win from CC/PP is that you can define a variation on a document -if you get back a document and not a location header. EARL can use CC/PP info to evaluate the content in the context of the device on which it will be used     Danbri published some rough notes on EARL  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Dec/0099.html  and sbp's response:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Dec/0111.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Gregory,    These 2 checkpoints are P3 because providing a summary or header   abbreviations make it "easier" to get the info from a table.  If an author   does not provide a summary or header abbreviations, it is not making it   "impossible" or "difficult" to access the information in a table. UNLESS a   summary is so well written that a user would not need to access the   table.   Therefore, I could see upgrading "summary" to P2 for complex   tables, p3 for others.  Headers I still see as "helpful" i.e. they decrease   reading time and annoyance (based on the current WCAG use of the "abbr"   attribute and not ABBR element.  ABBR issues are handled in checkpoint 4.2,   also a P3).    Yes, authors should be encouraged to provide as much semantic information   as possible.  The WCAG prioritizes that info based on how well it can help   the user access the information, in this case we are refering to the TABLE   element.  Summaries and table header abbreviations do not help access   nearly as much as appropriate structure, identifying headers, etc.    unless you can prove me otherwise...    --wendy              >At 07:22 PM 12/15/99 -0500, Gregory J.

      Technique 1.1.K is priority 3.  However, it is a technique of a Priority 1   checkpoint.    If the priority of the WCAG checkpoint is not inherited, then how do we   define priorities for this document? I do not believe we can inherit the   priority definitions from WCAG.  The priority definitions would probably be   similar to ATAG [1] yet have to be stated in the context of this document.    If we define priorities for this document, are we expecting people to   conform to it?    If we are expecting people to conform to it, then I think that implies we   want to take this to Recommendation status.  Do we want to take it to   Recommendation or release it as a Note?    thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-WAI-AUTOOLS-19991026/#priorities  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        >  >* Do current screen readers even recognize when a DHTML menu drops down?    First of all, you assume that screen readers are activating the   menus.  Most DHTML "menus" are activated by a mouseover.  Screen reader   users do not use the mouse, they use the keyboard.  Therefore, the first   step to making DHTML menus accessible to screen readers is to not only   activate them from a mouseover but also when they receive focus from a   keyboard action.    Secondly, you assume that you have to use images.  Depending on the look   you are trying to achieve, you may or may not be able to use style   sheets.  This is a minor point.    Thirdly, and most importantly, as Dave Woolley responded, you need to make   sure that the page is usable without the DHTML.    I have documented a case study that I played with last year at   http://www.w3.org/2000/08/wcag-dhtml/    It is by no means an exhaustive list and several open issues exist. I   encourage people to play with the examples given in the site to:  1. break them and record how they break  2. find better ways to do them  3. let me know about other common practices that we need to investigate.    This information will eventually end up in a chapter of the WCAG Techniques   document.    Thanks,  --wendy      >* If it contains ALTs and TITLEs, can the screen reader navigate it?

      Andi Snow-Weaver has been collecting issues for the HTML Techniques from the WAI IG mailing list.  The list is published at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/html-tech-issues.html    And linked to from the WAI GL home page.    Thanks Andi!    We also have an issues list for CSS Techniques (that Andi also helped pull together):  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/css-tech-issues.html    If you would like to work on any of these open issues or contribute to any of these documents in some way, please let me know.  I can redirect you to the appropriate people.      On the WCAG WG home page, I've listed the following volunteers who have agreed to oversee the following sections of the CSS Techniques:  Sections 1-5 Joel Sanda  Sections 6-10 Jo Miller  Sections 11-15 Matt May    Thank you,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Note that <Q> is not required. It is an example but it does not appear in   the checklist. I agree that it is a bad example because it is not   supported. Therefore, I propose that we add an Errata that changes the   wording of this checkpoint to read,  <blockquote>  <dl>  <dt><a name="entry-9">9.</a> Correction to example text for checkpoint 3.7  <dd>Added: 15 January 2001  <dd>Type: Clarification  <dd>Refers to: Checkpoint 3.7  <dd>Description.  Checkpoint 3.7 should be reworded to remove the example   for Q as:  3.7 Mark up quotations. Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects   such as indentation. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML, use the BLOCKQUOTE   element to markup quotations.  </blockquote>    At 07:13 PM 1/15/01 , Jason White wrote:      >On Mon, 15 Jan 2001, Kynn Bartlett wrote:  > > Question:  Has it -ever- been proven in practice that use of <Q>  > > increases accessibility for people with disabilities?

      At today's meeting I volunteered to make WART generate EARL (perhaps WART   will ooze EARL rather than generate it...who knows...we can have a lot of   fun with these acronyms...).    First of all, what about the name?  As fond as I am of "WART" it stands for   "Web Accessibility Report Tool" and EARL is more than that.  How about   "Conformance Report Tool" (acronym collision with CRT!) or EARL Report Tool   or ... suggestions?  For now, I'll call it WART since that's more   fun.  Perhaps it will just stand for, "Whatever. Anything Report Tool."    Regardless, I have created a plan page for it with a lovely photo of a wart   hog at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WART/plan.html    Let me know what you think,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

JW yes. open issue. sticking to  Next face2face  CS next face2face?  WC Perhaps in November, but  JW Blind Citizens Australia have made an informal to host the meeting.  Guideline 11  11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a   task and use the latest versions when supported. [Priority 2]  CS what about ECMAScript?  JW main reason is that W3C recommendations undergo extensive accessibility   review and therefore we wanted to push those.  CS what about accessibility review of ECMAScript standards? is it happening?  JW DOM is related and that is independent of the scripting language.   Interesting question, "is one scripting language better (more accessible)   than another, or is DOM enough?"  CS agree, DOM is the piece we need to be concerned about. That should be   clear at the Techniques level. Because it infers that I should avoid scripting.  JW no W3C scripting language, thus doesn't apply.  JW A related issue, XHTML modules developed by user communities are not W3C   technologies but basd on W3C technologies. By implication they would count.  GR The 4 checkpoints under G11 are general, but a new checkpoint might be   needed. "when one is creating XHTML/XML applications one should use   schemas"....meta-level requirement of what authors should use. in   techniques would discuss RDF Schemas.  JW an interesting place to address these issues.  WC XML applications have not been reviewed, therefore don't agree with JW's   implication. Believe that we need something general, "ensure that language   you are using conforms to XML accessibility guidelines." In techniques, we   would have those guidelines. The easy gimme is, "W3C languages." Beyond   that you need to ensure that the language you are using will allow you to   create accessible content.  Guideline 12  12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation.   [Priority 1]  12.2 Describe the purpose of frames and how frames relate to each other if   it is not obvious by frame titles alone. [Priority 2]  12.3 Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where   natural and appropriate. [Priority 2]  12.4 Associate labels explicitly with their controls. [Priority 2]  CS very HTML specific. 12.2 as well. push to techniques.same as 12.4?  JW last week, discussed this. table headers, form controls, titles all play   the same role and should be brought together. these are all labels or   titles of other content. 12.1 and 12.4  WC 12.2 is longdesc.  CS summaries, longdesc, alt-text often serve the same purpose - still   descriptions.  WC there are differences.  CS they are all secondary versions of the same content.  JW prefer to draw a distinction between equivalents and descriptions,   titles, and labels.  CS what about table summary?  JW in the category similar to label. it is not intended to replace the   content but clarify it.  CS ok with that. similar but not identical.  WC a checkpoint from last week that 12.1 and 12.4 should fall under?  JW some agreement that labeling-type checkpoints should be brought   together. did not discuss these specifically.  GR only 12.4 was specifically addressed.  WC 12.2 generalized to, "Describe the relationships between elements"   include frames." primary use of RDF.  JW in SVG major accessibility feature. similar to table summaries and other   summaries of content. all of those could be considered related. we can   decide how to deal with them.  WC think 12.3 is very related to 12.2 because showing relationships and   providing meta-information for elements.  GR structural issue.  JW seems more related to Guideline 3 it is requiring appropriate structure.  GR want to make sure that the linkage.  WC argue that it is similar to 12.2 because it is providing   meta-information. MAP is one technique for doing this, just as RDF is. It   goes beyond structure. Agree that 12.3 could be more general don't need to   decide now where it goes.  GR similar to UA issue of what is human readable vs. machine-readable.  JW joint meeting with UA next week, bring up these issues then?  Guideline 13  13.1 Clearly identify the target of each link.  JW raised by CMN last week. server-side image map links can fall under this   as a technique.  WC general enough but could apply to more cases than does now?  JW yes. but not sure if needs rewording to indicate that additional cases   are subsumed in this checkpoint. not saying there was consensus.  WC how do people on this call feel about that?  CS makes sense.  DB crux of issue?  JW that server-side image maps would fall under this checkpoint. flag as   interesting point to return to.  13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.   [Priority 2]  JW WC proposed combining back in with 12.2 and 12.3.  WC yes.  JW in the next version we need to make the cross-references and   dependencies between checkpoints clear.  GR AU attempted to address this.  13.3 Provide information about the general layout of a site (e.g., a site   map or table of contents). [Priority 2]  CS another form of metadata?  JW in a sense, but it is written rather than in the markup. thinks it falls   into the same category of table summaries but a larger entity which is   being summarized. if had clearer guidance about summaries, when and how   provided, we could try to bring it together. just a proposal.  CS could see it either standing on own or combined with summaries. another   form of metadata but process is very different.  JW these concerns should be treated as interrelated. these are also   important for cognitive and learning disabilities.  DB how would this apply to a portal site?  CS perhaps this requirements is only applicable to sites with many pages.   for a site with 5 pages the navbar is the site map.  JW yes.  CS we don't say, "where appropriate."  WC should generalize "general layout" to read "provide info about the   organization of the site" so that the site with 5 pages would have a navbar   and that's all that is needed.  CS right. read it to mean "provide a site map."  JW yes. agree.  13.4 Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner. [Priority 2]  WC need to keep distinction between Provide mechanisms and use them   consistently.  JW and GR agree.  /* no issues */  13.5 Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the navigation   mechanism. [Priority 3]  JW should go under 13.3 as a special case.  CS agree.  WC yep.  13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until   user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group. [Priority 3]  CS another metadata grouping thing.  JW and related to proper structure of the content. a block of links is a   component of a document.  WC yep.  13.7 If search functions are provided, enable different types of searches   for different skill levels and preferences. [Priority 3]  JW new requirement directed at cognitive and learning disabilities.  WC yep, general.  CS yep.  JW everyone agrees needs to exist in next version.  DB yep.  13.8 Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings,   paragraphs, lists, etc. [Priority 3]  JW aimed at cognitive issues and people accessing through speech.  WC keep for now.  GR yep. P3.  13.9 Provide information about document collections (i.e., documents   comprising multiple pages.). [Priority 3]  CS another metadata.  JW and related to 13.3  WC yep.  13.10 Provide a means to skip over multi-line ASCII art. [Priority 3]  CS there is another one to skip over sections.  WC to skip over groups of links to get to content.  JW another interim until user agents can allow navigation of structure.   author shouldn't have to do this if they use the correct structure. should   go with the "skip over" requirements. it should have an until user agent   requirement.  WC also applies to using markup correctly: use SVG to create the graphic,   or provide image and alt-text.  JW connection also between using SVG and client-side image maps to provide   semantics.  GR a good distinction to make.  Guideline 14  14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's   content. [Priority 1]  14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will   facilitate comprehension of the page. [Priority 3]  JW Related to cognitive disabilities. Should stand as they are.  CS, WC agree  DB not discussing priority today?  JW right.  14.3 Create a style of presentation that is consistent across pages.   [Priority 3]  JW Very similar to using navigation mechanisms consistently (13.3)  WC so a generalized consistency statement?  DB, CS, GR, JW yes.  JW don't obliterate distinctions. combine into one checkpoint, make   distinctions in techniques.  @@WC review minutes from today and last week and draft what a generalized   version would look like.  /* time check */  JW no more issues? ready for next item on the agenda?  /* no comments */  Review of open action items  CS in the process of posting concerns about examples used in GL3 (and   anywhere else that concern her) to list. Have had brief exchange with Frank   re: dynamic content.  WC believe Marti and Tim are still working on PDF. I have not talked with   Rob lately about Flash.  JW non-w3c technologies module exists and therefore consider this closed.   People ought to review and comment.  Draft requirements document  CS much clearer  DB question about 5. we can list the needs of people or will the   checkpoints reflect that need in what they require.  JW the latter.  DB did not get that. the revisiosn of the guidelines, the checkpoints,   reflect the needs of people with the following disabilities.  JW, WC fine.  DB leaving ourselves room by saying, "as completely as possible."  JW requirements document can be modified throughout the process. should be   a firm reluctance to change what is agreed upon, but there is no absoluate   bar against doing so.  DB what is the, "the inability to interpret and/or formulate language   symbols" illiteracy?  WC illiteracy and aphasia.  DB really?  WC that's what Jonathan and Anne are arguing for.  DB we want to be careful.  WC we need to address these issues, and will address as completely as   possible. there may be limits to what we can require. I think using images   as supplements to text can help. I don't think we can require that  JW we need to clearly identify the issues. we are working on a process to   deal with this issue.  DB i worry about the time and energy required on this topic and worry we   won't get to other issues because of it.  JW yes, the discussion needs to be channelled.  DB keep in mind the achievability of checkpoints. some things are out of   the realm of possibilities, like "provide alternative graphics for text."   that's not going to happen. i really want to address the needs of people   with CD/LD but designers will not be able to do that for all much less a   majority of their content. i mean, if so easy then why don't we communicate   via images over e-mail?  JW we're trying to bring together relevant people, perhaps in a   teleconference devoted to CD/LD.  GR to counter your arguments, DB, graphical chat clients are very popular.   emoticons are used in e-mail. there are issues. a discussion would be good.  DB yes. further discussion would be good.  DB what about discussion from F2F about using a database?  WC after much discussion with Ian, we didn't want to set in stone the shape   the deliverables would take. We highlighted that we would discuss with   audience what their needs are then try to address them. do usability testing.  JW there was usability testing done on the last version, early on. we need   to look at existing overviews and determine how they could be modified to   address various audience needs. overall goal: precision and clarity. could   be addressed that this is a precise technical specification and that we   have to write it as clearly as we can.  DB 4 is very ambitious. be satisfied if we could meet the first 3 things.  CS important to keep them all in there.  DB agree, want to have a nice "spin" that we are not limiting to   accessible. good to promote international and innovative. but happy more or   less with way it is written.  JW we need to be careful of how we define relationships with other working   groups. they are all depending on these guidelines in one way or another.    $Date: 2000/04/21 04:06:03 $ Wendy Chisholm  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        Issue 681 [1] is a question from Greg Lowney who interprets "operable via a   keyboard or keyboard interface" [2] to mean that if the user's operating   system has mousekeys the author does not need to do anything to the content.    If this is likely to be a common interpretation, I propose adding a note to   the guideline that says, "Keyboard and keyboard interface does not include   mouse emulators such as mousekeys."    If this is not likely to be a common interpretation, I can respond to Greg   and clarify the intent with him.    Cleaning up the examples (issues 381 [3] and 702 [4]) should further   clarify the intent.    --wendy    [1] <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=681>  [2] <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-WCAG20-20040311/#keyboard-operation>  [3] <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=381>  [4] <http://trace.wisc.edu/bugzilla_wcag/show_bug.cgi?id=702>    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      Participants:  Sean Palmer, Charles McCathieNevile, Wendy Chisholm, Daniel Dardailler    Summary:  - Action WC try another stab at EARL abstract.  - Action DD send perl script for WART to list  - Action WC look for  Perl packages that generate RDF and MIME attachments.  - Action WC Talk with Ralph and Eric about saving/querying EARL with Annotea  - Action WC implementation plan for WART.  - Action SP Send DD a list of possible places to meet for ER/PF F2F in   Brighton (possibly end of 1st week of October or the week of the 15th of   October).      Detailed minutes...  EARL abstract and DIWG    CMN cross-over between transcoding an accessibility and CC/PP (this is what   I can deal with), and EARL (if you've got that type of profile, you   probably can't deal with this).  Useful approaches to the same problem.    CC/PP is about profiles, EARL is about conformance.    This collection of checkpoints means conformance to a CC/PP profile.    Then they want DAML-OIL stuff - our languages do the same stuff...    I don't see EARL having a major role in there    /* WC rereads WL's reaction to initial abstract notes */    CMN EARL is QA, if go down that road    SP Wrote XSLT to save EARL in a linear form so could include in a linear   data model.    CMN Why not put RDF in HTML?    SP No DTD for RDF, no way to validate.    Action WC try another stab at EARL abstract.    /* CMN gets DD on the phone to talk about WART */    WART    DD It's a perl script, series of CGI, that send an e-mail to the   archive.  There is a step where data is gathered and sends e-mail. Instead   could generate EARL report. I can send perl script to list.    Action DD send perl script for WART to list    WC Where is it?    DD There is a CGI bin directory on tux.    WC The flow of the forms need to be changed.    DD Right, comments from a while back that weren't   implemented.  wai/report/db it gets a dozen or less messages.  Where would   the EARL piece go? attachments?  The mail is text.    CMN Eric has an RDF database that we could pump into and query another   alternative is post as an annotea annotation.    WC First piece just to generate it.    DD Would like to see pointer from archive message to eARL, either as an   attachment or another URL - pointer. Somehow pointer between EARL and   report.  Attachment is easiest way. Hopefully perl package to generate MIME   attachment easily. Or attach as n3, but harder to read.  Perl package for   RDF?    Action WC look for  Perl packages that generate RDF and MIME attachments.    CMN Syntax for generating Annotea is simple. Worth working out with them.   Eric and Ralph.    DD Not sure worth it. It's independent. It's reusing it by different tools.    CMN Annotea will give it a home URI where we can get it from.  There will   be an RDF document that will be linked.  It would also give Jose a target   to start looking at how to deal with them in Amaya and Giorgio with   usablenet stuff.  They have a place to put and get EARL from.    DD The attachment will give it a URI.    CMN Annotea will give a typed relationship.  Can do an annotea query on a page.    Action WC Talk with Ralph and Eric about saving/querying EARL with Annotea    CMN Write up an implementation plan to see how reuse with ATAG.    Action WC implementation plan for WART.      ER F2F    DD Join with PF beginning of October in Europe.    Action SP: Send DD a list of possible places to meet for ER/PF F2F in Brighton.    DD Oxford?    SP A bit far.    WC 1 day PF, 1 day ER?    DD 2 or 3 days, yes.    end of week of 1st or week of 15th.      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

      The W3C is working to decrease the spam on our lists.  As such, we have a   series of lists of e-mail who we will accept e-mail from.  If an e-mail is   sent to w3c-wai-gl from someone who is not on one of the lists, it gets   sent to me. I either delete i (spam) or forward it on.  In the case of   Andi's regrets, I should have forwarded it so that it kept her name of the   message.  I will do this in the future.    I'm  working to get the right e-mails on the right accept lists.  It may   take a little while to get this all sorted out. Bear with me.    thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/01/18-minutes.html    Minutes from 18 January 2001 WCAG WG Telecon    Summary of resolutions and action items  ?       Resolved: Guideline 1. Design content that allows presentation   according to the user's needs and preferences. Add piece to text   immediately after Guideline 1 that prefs based on devices/user agents. Add   open issue to flag that device capabilities are current or what could be   acquired?  ?       Resolved: Under Guideline 1. "for more information about user   capabilities, device, etc... Refer to the working draft "How People with   Disabilities Use the Web" for more information and user scenarios,   particularly to find out how people with disabilities use assistive   technologies.  ?       Resolved: leave 1.5 as it is. Add to issues list: use something   instead of word "content."  ?       Resolved: Checkpoint 1.7 Content remains accessible when newer   technologies are not supported or turned off.  ?       Open issue: Checkpoint 1.7 avoid term graceful transformation.   incorporate idea of backwards compatibility.  ?       Resolved: Guideline 2 Design content that allows interaction   according to the user's needs and preferences  ?       Resolved: Checkpoint 2.2 Minimize content that interferes with the   user's ability to concentrate. Then below instead of "disorient the user   and" say "interfere with ability to concentrate and focus on the main   content" Also, "User agents may also offer control over this effect."  ?       Resolved: leave Checkpoint 2.3 as is.  ?       Resolved: leave Checkpoint 4.3 as is.  ?       Resolved: incorporate Judy's comments. Change idea in status from   "internal use" to "request feedback."  ?       Resolved: Leave checkpoint 1.2 as is, but add to issues list: WCAG   2.0 does not address the case of an audio-only presentation that requires a   timed response. GV proposes to modify checkpoint 1.2 to read, "Synchronize   text equivalents with multimedia and time-based interactive presentations"   Others feel that this might be addressed by a combination of 1.1, 1.2, and   2.4.  ?       Resolved: Describe what the illustrative image is (associated with   checkpoint 1.1) and move it to checkpoint 3.4 as an example.    Participants  Jason, Len, William, Dick, Donovan, Matt, Aniska, Wendy, Gregg, Loretta,   Andi, Cynthia  Regrets  Gregory    Ian's comments on 12 January draft of WCAG 2.0    Ian's proposed wording to Guideline 1  JW Add hardware and software environment to make it clearer.  GV yes, much better.  LK Environment pretty technical - what about "the hardware and software   that the user uses." Can't figure out a better wording right here. It's   still a fuzzy term but can't think of a better wording. Just raising a flag.  JW A definition in the glossary?  LK Yes, that would make me happy.  GV What if remove word environment?  MM Worried about hardware and software - it's extremely broad. Someone   could claim problem with accessibility if only have 8 megs of ram.  LK Adding word environment doesn't help that problem.  MM User agent and device(s) is more descriptive.  WL Device(s) also have 8 meg ram problem.  MM Yet capabilities are not included in the list immediately below it.  LK This wording implies design for what the user currently has or what the   user could get.  GV User and their devices.  JW user agents are not devices.  LK Needs depends upon what user agents, devices they have.  WC Propose to stop after user preferences, and immediately following say   that prefs and needs include device issues. Also, open issue that flags   Len's point (the device capabilities they currently have or could acquire).  Resolved: Design content that allows presentation according to the user's   needs and preferences. Add piece to text immediately after Guideline 1 that   prefs based on devices/user agents. Add open issue to flag that device   capabilities are current or what could be acquired?  ASW Device capabilities should mention assistive technology.  WL Already refer to "How people with disabilities use the web."  Resolved: Under Guideline 1. "for more information about user capabilities,   device, etc... Refer to the working draft "How People with Disabilities Use   the Web" for more information and user scenarios, particularly to find out   how people with disabilities use assistive technologies.    Proposal for checkpoint 1.5  WC Propose leave as is, see what happens with glossary.  ASW agree.  JW change content to "semantics" or "meaning."  MM Philosophical issue. Content is content. It is well known and used and   everything on a page. I would tell people working on glossary that we have   issues if they try to do something different.  WL You'll have those issues no matter what you put in instead of "content."  JW I think content is best avoided given the ambiguities. Leave as is and   put on issues for work later on.  WL Control how content is displayed. Does it then become presentation?  Resolved: leave 1.5 as it is. Add to issues list: use something instead of   word "content."  MM Then replace "c" in WCAG.    Transform gracefully  WC IJ does not have a proposal. We left this as an open issue last meeting.  GV A theme not a checkpoint.  WC Main idea is "backwards compatible."  JW Add to glossary.  GV Sounds like a general concept. When turn something off is not backwards   compatible.  JW "Remains accessible"  MM "transform" bring to mind XSLT. What about degrade?  GV Is derogatory. Ensure that content remains accessible when technology is   not supported or turned off.  ASW Issue is not so much wording for checkpoint but specifying what people   must support.  GV What does "technology" mean? My computer? If HTML is not   supported...we're not saying any arbitrary technology.  WC Problem with "newer."  GV What about non-text technology.  WC Propose to remove the checkpoint and move to open issues list.  GV Do we have something that covers the issue of applets?  WC Perhaps "use specs according to spec" or "provide text equivalents"  JW Content remains accessible when newer technologies are not supported or   turned off.  LK When technologies that are not accessible to all users..  GV It could be accessible to all users but I may not load them.  Resolved: Checkpoint 1.7 Content remains accessible when newer technologies   are not supported or turned off.  GV priority? if the person could have used a technology that could make it   accessible then it shouldn't be a P1, but everything else should be a P1.  Open issue: Checkpoint 1.7 avoid term graceful transformation. incorporate   idea of backwards compatibility.  MM Worried about "newer" won't amount to much. It will be hard to   understand. Until we can figure out what we're trying to say, this   shouldn't be a checkpoint.    Guideline 2  Resolved: Guideline 2 Design content that allows interaction according to   the user's needs and preferences    Checkpoint 2.2  LK what about "Minimize content that will distract the user"  WL disorient.  GV Animations and blinking text would distract, not sure how disorient.  CS No more porn sites, eh?  GV No more advertisements?  WC Minimize content that interferes with the user's ability to concentrate.  GV Yes, distract too strong. Then below instead of disorient say "interfere   with ability to concentrate ... on the main content."  LK Why saying minimize rather than don't do it?  GV Can't tell people not to have banner ads.  WC Give users control of content that interferes with the user's ability to   concentrate. Then below instead of "disorient the user and" say "interfere   with ability to concentrate and focus on the main content"  GV Restrict to one section does not apply. Therefore, give control to turn   off or ??  MM People couldn't comply.  CS Shouldn't be goal of authors to turn off advertising.  WL If you preclude user options...  MM The user can choose to circumvent the technology, but if you prevent   advertisements, then the advertising industry is gone and there go the sites.  JW What is the accessibility requirement?  LK On one hand we should leave it out, on the other we need mechanisms to   handle them. That mechanism should not be by changing the guideline but   something that applies to any guideline. Any guideline is suspect to   exemption if poses a problem.  GV This will have to be a priority 3 or end up with a problem if you   mandate that people can turn off banners.  LK Every guideline will have a case where it causes a genuine hardship.   Under compliance build in that if it is a severe problem you don't have to   do it.  CS Depends on what is content - advertising could be the main content and   the news article is distracting from advertiser.  MM The burden should be on the people causing the animations.  Resolved: Checkpoint 2.2 Minimize content that interferes with the user's   ability to concentrate. Then below instead of "disorient the user and" say   "interfere with ability to concentrate and focus on the main content" Also,   "User agents may also offer control over this effect."  MM If content provider is person designing ads, then they can address some   of these issues.  LK Still need a definition of minimize.  GV Whenever get into area of mental processes we can not deal with   "complete" for example we can deal with complete blindness and complete   deafness but not completely distractible.    Checkpoint 2.3  WC Propose to leave as is.  GV As it is reworded, much clearer.  Resolved: leave Checkpoint 2.3 as is.    Checkpoint 4.3  JW leave alone.  CS agree.  ASW Agree.  Resolved: leave Checkpoint 4.3 as is.    Judy's comments  WC Need abstract, editorial comments to intro, get rid of WAI logo, etc.   Editorial  WL Change "internal use" to "capture feedback" intended to change.  Resolved: incorporate Judy's comments. Change idea in status from "internal   use" to "request feedback."    Checkpoint 1.2  GV "Synchronize text equivalents with multimedia presentations" add   "time-based interactive"  WC what about interactive media?  GV Where timing is important - interaction has to occur at specific   times....with interactive or multimedia  ASW Synchronize text equivalents with time-based multimedia.  GV no, an audio track is time-based and a transcript is ok. Could put links   that say "now" and solve it.  LK What about if I'm deaf and my wife is not and we're listening to a radio   program, then I miss the jokes when she laughs.  WC Think this could be covered in some way by this checkpoint, 2.4 and 1.1.  JW I think 2.4 could be expanded to include this issue.  WC Add a note under 1.2 as place holder but don't change 1.2 for now. move   to open issue list.  GV "If there is time-based interaction, alternatives must be synchronized   or non-time based must be provided."  Resolved: Leave checkpoint 1.2 as is, but add to issues list: WCAG 2.0 does   not address the case of an audio-only presentation that requires a timed   response. GV proposes to modify checkpoint 1.2 to read, "Synchronize text   equivalents with multimedia and time-based interactive presentations"   Others feel that this might be addressed by a combination of 1.1, 1.2, and 2.4.    Checkpoint 1.1  GV The graphic ought to be explained.  WC uses a d-link.  GV No, this should be in the content of the document.  Resolved: Describe what the illustrative image is (associated with   checkpoint 1.1) and move it to checkpoint 3.4 as an example.    $Date: 2001/01/18 22:54:29 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

      Hello,    The latest working draft is available from:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20.  If there are no major objections we will   request this document be published as a public working draft on Tuesday, 23   January 2001.    I have included the list of changes in this message and they are also   available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/change-history.html    I have also updated the checkpoint mapping:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2001/01/20-mapping.html    List of changes to this draft. These edits are the result of discussion at   the 18 January 2001 telecon:  ?       Edited Guideline 1 based on Ian's suggestion.  ?       Edited text immediately following Guideline 1.  ?       Edited Checkpoint 1.7 to replace the phrase "transform gracefully."  ?       Edited Guideline 2 per Ian's suggestion.  ?       Edited Checkpoint 2.2 - replaced use of word "focus". Also edited   supplementary text.  ?       Added an Abstract.  ?       Deleted the WAI logo (no W3C working draft includes the domain logo   at the top).  ?       Brought the copyright up front.  ?       Added Appendix B: Contributors.  ?       Edited the "Priorities and techniques" section per Judy's suggestions.  ?       Made sure the following phrases were used and capitalized   consistently throughout the document: Working Group and Working Draft.  ?       Updated the checkpoint mapping.  ?       Moved the icon from checkpoint 1.1 to checkpoint 3.4 and use it as   an example.  ?       Edited the first sentence of the Introduction to make clear that   the draft's purpose is for feedback rather than internal discussion by the   Working Group.    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

        We received several comments on the 28 August 2002 draft about checkpoint  1.2 [10].  Andi Snow-Weaver, John Slatin, and others have proposed changes   to this checkpoint.  There has been discussion both on the list and at   teleconferences.    With this email I outline thirteen proposals (including those already   discussed but not yet included in an internal draft) to address the issues   with this checkpoint. Let's attempt to resolve as many of the issues with   discussion on the mailing list and reserve the teleconference time for   larger issues.    ==========    Comment #1  - WWAAC (via David Poulson and Colette Nicolle), 4 Nov 2002 [0]  minimum level success criteria #1: Wording of this section is unwieldy and   difficult to follow.  - SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002 [9]  Is this point talking about replacing the existing soundtrack with an   alternate audio, or having an alternate audio available in addition to the   existing soundtrack?    Proposal #1  Accept John Slatin's rewording (with Gregg Vanderheiden and Lee Robert's   input) of the minimum level success criterion #1 [1]:    1. an audio description is provided of all significant visual information   in scenes, actions and events that cannot be perceived from the sound track   alone.    Note: When adding audio description to existing materials, the amount of   information conveyed through audio description is constrained by the amount   of available space available in the existing audio track.  It may also be   impossible or inappropriate to freeze the  audio/visual program to insert   additional audio description.    ==========    Comment #2  Bill Mason, 28 Aug 2002 [4]  Minimum level success criterion 2: exempts news and emergency information   from captioning, yet below in Example 2 a news story about an emergency is   captioned.    Proposal #2  Reword the exception to:  "If the Web content is real-time and audio-only and not time-sensitive and   not interactive a transcript or other non-audio equivalent is sufficient."  Rationale:  The exception is difficult to decipher. The exception currently   reads, "if the Web content is real-time audio-only, if not time-sensitive   (news, emergency, etc.), and not interactive, a transcript or other   non-audio equivalent is sufficient."  I *think* that the comma and "if"   after "audio-only" implies an "and" but I'm not sure.  If I have interpreted this correctly and since example 2 is a news story   that *is* time-sensitive a transcript or other non-audio equivalent is   *not* sufficient.  (but - why? it seems that the only time audio-only media   needs to be captioned is when it is interactive...I must admit I'm a bit   confused by this one).    ==========    Comment #3  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [8]  Benefits: The Note ends with a sentence that sounds like a success   criteria: "Where possible, provide content so that it does not require   dual, simultaneous attention or so that it gives the user the ability to   effectively control/pause different media signals."    Proposal #3  Accept Andi Snow-Weaver's proposal (that reflects mailing list and telecon   discussion) [3] of a new success criterion at level 3:  3. The presentation does not require the user to view captions and the   visual presentation simultaneously in order to understand the content.    ==========    Proposal #4  Accept John Slatin's rewording of the definition of audio description [2]:    audio descriptions are equivalents of visual information from actions,   body language, graphics, and scene changes.  Audio descriptions are voiced   (either by a human or  a speech synthesizer) and synchronized with the multimedia presentation.    ==========    Proposal #5  Accept John Slatin's rewording of the Note that appears in the Benefits [2]:  Note: Time-dependent presentations requiring people to use a single sense   to follow two or more things at the same time may present significant   barriers to some users. Depending on the nature of the of presentation, it   may be possible to avoid scenarios where, for example, a deaf user would be   required to watch an action on the screen and read the captions at the same   time. However, this would not be achievable for live broadcasts (e.g. a   football game). Where possible, provide content so that it does not require   tracking multiple simultaneous events with the same sense, or give the user the  ability to effectively control different media signals independently.    ==========    Proposal #6  Accept Andi Snow-Weaver's new example [3].   need to clarify that this is   not an example of minimum level conformance, but of level 3.  do we need to   label other examples?  Example 4: a cooking video (level 3).  A cooking video shows a chef preparing a recipe. The chef describes the   ingredients and the process for each step and then performs the step. In   this manner, deaf users can read the voice captions first and then watch   the demonstration.    ==========    Comment #7  Ian Jacobs, 06 Oct 2002 [5]  Normative exclusions appear in provisions 2, 4, and after 6. (refer to   comments on exclusions and inclusions)    Proposal #7  No change proposed at this time.  Rationale: Need more research. It is not clear that moving all of the   exceptions to one spot will make the success criteria easier to   understand.  It could decrease understandability if people do not easily or   correctly identify the exceptions with the criteria.  The exceptions might   also be ignored if not included with the criteria.    ==========    Comment #8  Ian Jacobs, 06 Oct 2002 [5]  (level 2 success criterion #3) "for all live broadcasts that are   professionally produced." The term "professional" is subject to much   interpretation. Does this mean "high quality" or "for money"?    Proposal #8  reword to: provide captions and audio descriptions for live, commercially   produced broadcasts.  Rationale: From what I remember, we were trying to target live broadcasts   where it is feasible (i.e., the producer could afford) to provide real-time   captioning.  Also, there are several comments about writing criteria in   active voice, so I attempted that, also.    ==========    Comment #9  - Diane Dent, 21 Oct 2002 [6]  level 2 success criterion #1 seems to be missing a word.  - IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [8]  Level 2 success criterion #1 should be moved to Level 3    Proposal #9  No change proposed.  Rationale: Diane and Andi commented on the 22 August draft.  In the 28   August draft this criterion was reworded. While we might be able to write   it more clearly, I don't believe it is missing a word nor that it should be   moved to level 3.  It currently reads, "the audio description has been reviewed and is   believed to include all significant visual information in scenes, actions   and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track) to the extent   possible given the constraints posed by the existing audio track (and   constraints on freezing the audio/visual program to insert additional   auditory description)."    ==========    Comment #10  Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 [7]  Minimum level success criterion 5: The way it currently reads suggests   there are 2 conditions #5 is meant to cover.  Should the sentences be split   into separate bullets or rewritten?    Proposal #10  Reword minimum level success criterion #5 to:  If the Web content is real-time non-interactive video (e.g., a Webcam of   ambient conditions), either provide an equivalent that conforms to   checkpoint 1.1 (e.g., an ongoing update of weather conditions) or link to   an equivalent that conforms to checkpoint 1.1 (e.g., a link to a weather   Web site).    Rationale:  It currently reads, "if the Web content is real-time non-interactive video   (e.g. a Webcam of ambient conditions), an accessible alternative is   provided that achieves the purpose of the video. If the author's purpose is   to provide real-time information, a media equivalent is provided that   conforms to checkpoint 1.1, or a link is provided to content elsewhere   which conforms to checkpoint 1.1 (e.g. a link to a weather Web site)."    Basically we're saying "either provide an equivalent yourself or link to   one," right?  If so, then I think we can simplify the criterion as proposed.    ==========    Comment #11  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [8]  Level 2 success criterion #3 {now #4} ends with the phrase "... view only   the captions, the captions with the audio, or both together." "Both   together" is the same as "the captions with the audio".    Proposal #11  Adopt Andi's proposal, "only the captions, only the audio, or both together".    ==========    Comment #12  SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002 [9]  Minimum level success criterion #2: Why is captioning considered the   minimum? For non-real-time, wouldn't transcripts be OK? At least in cases   where the video is not conveying majorly important information, for example   if it's a video of an executive speaking at a conference.    Proposal #12  No change proposed.  Rationale:  Captioning is required as a minimum because there is visual   information even when the video is an executive speaking at a conference:   facial expressions, gestures, clothing, and other non-verbal cues convey   information.    ==========    Comment #13  SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002 [9]  level 3 success criterion #1: How is {a text document (a "script")...}   different from a transcript? This would be much easier to meet than the   current minimum criteria    Proposal #13  Reword level 3 success criterion #1 as:  provide a text document that merges all audio descriptions and captions   into a single transcript (in WCAG 1.0 referred to as a "collated text   transcript").  Rationale: This attempts to clarify what goes into the text document and   for people  familiar with WCAG 1.0 uses the old terminology.    ==========    [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0135.html  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0306.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0127.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0159.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0239.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0020.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0076.html  [7] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0111.html  [8] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0117.html  [9] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0130.html  [10] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/10/comments-WD-WCAG20-20020822.html#cp1-2    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

        Jon,    I think this issue is covered by checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and   structure available independently of presentation. [1]  Do you feel that   this checkpoint and its success criteria are not strong enough?  Could this   checkpoint be strengthened instead of adding a new checkpoint?    I think it is clear in the benefits for this checkpoint,  ""  Separating content and structure from presentation allows Web pages to be   presented differently to meet the needs and constraints of different users   without losing any of the information or structure. For example,   information can be presented via speech or braille (text) that was   originally intended to be presented visually.  ""    Perhaps we can make this more clear in the success criteria?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#use-style      At 10:17 AM 9/23/02, Jon Gunderson wrote:    >I would still like to see a checkpoint that states:  >  >Under Guideline 1:  >  >Checkpoint 1.x: Ensure that the font size and styling of text content is   >easy to change.  >  >Basically pushing (requiring?) people to use CSS for styling of text,   >rather than images.  >  >COMMENT:  >Authors using images to style text is one of the fundamental problems of   >accessibility on the web.

      what about languages other than English?  Do we know of tests to run on   written text in Japanese? Chinese? German? Finnish? Spanish? Hebrew?   Arabic?  How do the tests differ between dialects?    Addressing the process used to determine if a site is accessible is very   important.  When I presented to a group at the U. of Wisconsin a couple   weeks ago, they said one of the biggest lessons they learned was about the   process that I use to determine if a site is accessible.  This includes   which tools I use and how I use them and most importantly, what questions   do I ask myself as I go through a site.  This process has not been   documented for WCAG 1.0 and should definitely be part of making the   requirements clear for WCAG 2.0. This gets back to a testing checkpoint   that Len suggested.  Perhaps we list tests that an author or evaluator must   run:  1. spelling  2. reading level or grammar check  3. validate syntax  4. lists of questions to ask:...    I'm not sure where this fits in.  Is it a checkpoint?  Is it a   technique?  Regardless, something like this would be valuable and something   I get requests for all the time.    Thoughts?  --wendy      At 05:01 PM 3/14/01 , you wrote:  >Kynn,  >  >         I've exerpted from your note to Al:  >  >At 07:35 AM 3/14/01 -0800, Kynn Bartlett wrote:  > >At risk of beating a drum, I really need to emphasize that the above  > >description -- which has been used by a number of people to illustrate  > >the problem -- is incomplete because it is really only along one  > >axis.

Only open issues are "accesskey" and   bidirectional tables.  JW discuss accesskey?  WC GR you are closest to this. what do you consider open?  GR Encourage authors to provide a list. Outline in post to AU group,   several test pages.  WC several users gone through?  GR IE only one that supports accesskey. problems with key bindings.   sometimes intercepted by User Agent. It should be up to the user. Alan   Cantor discussed limiting accesskeys numeric keys, but then only a limited set.  JW it's in the spec that it can be a unicode character with link or form   control.  CMN a fundamental problem with accesskey.  JW the name is a real problem with it, it should be "character" that you   can associate a mneumonic with it. Need to ensure that the user can enter   the character. Many of these are UA issues.  GR We need to cross-check that.  CMN There are mobile implementations of accesskey, such as IMode (although   it's not W3C compliant) uses accesskey. It only accepts 0-9. The rest it   ignores. IE ignores random sequences of accesskeys.  JW Perhaps a warning statement that older browsers only take 0-9. Basic   technique is to use a mnemonic key from the document.  CMN Problem originates with the HTML spec.  JW Propose that numeric characters are clearly available for legacy user   agents, the user should choose a character from character set of the document.  GR Also need to cover the case where accesskey is defined for every   character including numerics.  Action GR: write proposal for accesskey for HTML Techniques module.  GR Handle links and form controls separately or together?  JW Is there difference between them?  GR In IE4 it didn't support it on anchor, but on IE5 it does.  CMN worth pointing out that certain implementations ignore certain characters.  JW Yes, that should be noted.  WC Be sure to look at html compendium for that info, perhaps. /* Wendy   notes that the compendium does not seem to have 4.0 attribute listed... */    Device independence  JW Items common to a broader sense of guidelines: mobile,   internationalization. There is little which is unique to accessibility that   is common in the general approach. Our guidelines should be in harmony with   the general concerns. We need to identify how our guidelines fit into the   broader W3C work that is relevant and whether there are specific issues   that should be highlighted.  WL Exclusion has to be highlighted. If they aren't paying attention to it,   alarms should be raised. If someone adopts a set of guidelines to make   something easier to use that ignore this, they are incomplete.  WC Heading to Japan, what should I ask? look for?  WL Should take info, we know a lot about this.  GR Mobile content development in Japan is based on authoring tools, support   for objects. All for one. Deliver it in a variety of modalities.  WL If an org to provide usable output for cellphones, and they are outside   mainstream of what we're talking about, you don't need a group...  WC metaphor, we have to learn from each other. author has to provide breaks   in structure, define the cards.  JW Interested to know about inconsistency between WCAG and any   mobile-related guidelines. Also, any areas where greater harmonization can   occur.  Action WC Will do a comparison between guidelines for WAP, IMode and WCAG   before head to Japan.  JW Then we can look at the relationships betweeen them.  MK Looking at different services as well? Like what is happening at the   portals. What content do they have to store? They can't provide the same   content for the little screens vs. the big screens. How do they do that?  WC What about people on the call? Marshall?  MJ - don't have much experience, but can do research.  WC What aspect interested in researching?  Action MJ: investigate MK's question. How do the large portals provide info   for the different devices. How many diff. types of content do you need to   provide. What methods are used to provide the alternative content.  MK e.g., NetMorph.  JW interesting info for ER.    Requirements document  GR an alternate view. Concentrate on the technologies first.  JW Same requirement in substance, doesn't matter how it is expressed. Give   us greater room to move in.  Resolved: adopt Wendy's proposal for the Requirements document from 26 June   to group issues that minimum requirements must apply to.    Next meeting  Same time next week.  Resolved: Main topic on the agenda for next week's meeting is publishing   the Techniques doc as a public working draft.    $Date: 2000/06/29 21:12:16 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        1. In "How to read this document" update "Top layer..." [0] to reflect   changes if the principles proposal [1] is adopted.  Also update number of   guidelines listed in point #3 (currently says 19, but we've decreased   number recently)  [0] <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#how-to>  [1] <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2004JanMar/0361.html>    Overview of Design Principles [1.5] needs to be updated per proposal.  [1.5]  <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#overview-design-principles>    2. 2. Technology-specific Checklists  last sentence 1st paragraph says, "These documents will provide information   on what is required when using different technologies in order to meet the   WCAG 2.0 Working Draft access guidelines."  delete "access guidelines" at end of sentence to read:  "These documents will provide information on what is required when using   different technologies in order to meet the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft."    3. all instances of "working draft" need to be capitalized    4. Scope  2nd sentence, 1st paragraph says [2], "They include recommendations to make   pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of disabilities. "  replace "pages" with "content"  "They include recommendations to make content accessible and usable by   people with a full range of disabilities. "  in general, replace "page" with content.  [2] <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#scope>    5. Priorities and Techniques  [3] In general, this section needs to be tightened up. The paragraphs don't   flow and feel like they have been pasted together from different parts of   the document.  I will propose a rewrite to the list that cleans up this   section w/out altering the meaning.  [3] <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#priorities-techs>    6. Conformance  [4]  Editorial note says, "As we publish this Working Draft of WCAG 2.0,   the WCAG WG is in the midst of significantly changing the conformance   scheme from previous drafts."  I don't want to scare people too badly, suggest, "There are several open   issues with the proposed conformance scheme. This section outlines the   conformance scheme used throughout this document. Issues are outlined at XX   (link to bugzilla issues list related to conformance?). Feedback, comments,   and proposals are encouraged."    It says, "uidelines are divided into three categories of success criterion:"  replace "criterion" with "criteria"    It says, "Level 1 Success criterion:"  replace "criterion" with "criteria"  (do for each level)    Conformance claims:  points 4 and 5 say, " have ben met."  replace "ben"   with "been"    Point 5 either needs to have an editorial note or needs to be deleted since   I have not found evidence that the group seriously considered this as an   option.    [4] <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#conformance>    7. Overview of Desing Principles  says, " For example, people who are temporarily operating under constrained   conditions like operating in a noisy environment where they can not hear   well at all,"  should be "well or at all"    8. User Needs  The first two bullet points have modifying phrases that don't apply to the   correct subject.  Need to be cleaned up. Don't have good suggestion right now.  <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#user-needs>    This section only mentions a screen reader as an example of an assistive   technology. Propose that we either add other examples or delete screen   reader. Concerned that by only mentioning screen reader we further the myth   that we are only addressing issues for people who are blind or have low vision.    9. Guideline 1.1  Benefit #2 needs to be rewritten to fix odd modifiers.  Example #2 should not refer to "data themselves" should delete "themselves"    Times up for making comments...  --w    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

        Joe's book and Aries pamphlet are good places to start.  Here's a summary.    In Chapter 9 of "Building Accessible Web Sites," [1] Joe says  "If I confuse this item with something else, will I make a mistake? Will I   be unable to do what I want?"    "keep in mind you always have to think in groups.  When considering two   items, is the first on top of the second? Or right alongside?"    "Don't set red on black or black on red.  Don't set green on red or red on green.  Don't place the two halves of a confusable pair next to each other.  Don't mix beige/yellow/orange with red and green.  UNLESS  There is no actual chance of confusion.  The items are widely spaced.  The items have considerable difference in brightness."    "If, however, you wish to maximally avoid colour confusions, you have a   range of colour choices at your disposal.  Red/blue     Steps: Dark red; medium red; light red; light blue; medium blue; dark blue  Orange/blue     Steps: Dark orange; medium orange; light orange; light blue; medium   blue; dark blue  Orange/purple     Steps: Dark orange; medium orange; light orange; light purple; medium   purple; dark purple  Yellow/purple     Steps (note the restricted list): Yellow; light purple; medium purple;   dark purple"    "B-list:  Brown/blue     Steps: Dark brown; medium brown; light brown; light blue; medium blue;   dark blue  Yellow/blue     Steps: Yellow; light blue; medium blue; dark blue"    "You can mix white, black, and grey with confusable colours if the results,   given foreground/background combinations, contrast, and other factors, are   actually unconfusable.  You can use confusable colours all you want if the confusion has no impact   on the meaning or function of the site."    In "Effective Color Contrast" by Aries Arditi, PhD [2], he says  "Exaggerate lightness differences between foreground and background colors,   and avoid using colors of similar lightness adjacent to one another, eve if   they differ in saturation or hue...If you lighten your light colors and   darken your dark colors, you will increase the visual accessibility of your   design."    (in reference to a color wheel described at [3]),  "Choose dark colors with hues from the bottom half of the hue circle   against light colors from the top half of the circle. Avoid contrasting   light colors from the bottom half against dark colors from the top half."  "Avoid contrasting hues from adjacent parts of the hue circle, especially   if the colors do not contrast sharply in lightness."    In other words, Choose dark [blue, violet, purple or red] against light   [blue-green, green, yellow, or orange].  Avoid light [blue, violet, purple   or red] against dark [blue-green, green, yellow, or orange].  Orange on red   (or vice-versa) is not effective because they are next to each other in the   color wheel.  Yellow on purple (or vice versa) is effective since they are   not adjacent.    --w    [1] http://joeclark.org/book/sashay/serialization/Chapter09.html  [2] http://www.lighthouse.org/color_contrast.htm  [3] description of color wheel - light colors: blue-green, green, yellow,   orange.  dark colors: blue, violet, purple, red    At 03:55 PM 8/28/2003, you wrote:    > > ...However we can take steps to recommend content  > > providers avoid using colours which exacerbate the problem.

      Phil and Charles,  I have reworked my proposal. does this cover your suggestions and questions?    <proposal>  1. Flag images with:  * the IMG attribute alt="", alt=" ", and alt=" " (or alt=" ")  * OBJECT (of type="image/gif" or "image/png" etc.) that has no text content.  (Note that OBJECTs of other types should be handled elsewhere in the ERT   document.)    2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., <a   href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=" ">Refer to our home page</a>)   this is o.k.    3. If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the   image.    3a. If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those   words should not be separated, advise them to use   (or alt=" ")   instead of an image.    3b. If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text,   advise them to use style sheets, IMG alt=" ", or spaces in the content of   OBJECT.    3c. If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to   provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary a longer description.    3d. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of   the page, advise them to provide either brief descriptive text, that they   handle it as a "space" (see 3b), and suggest that they may also want to   provide a longer description of the image (on IMG with the "longdesc"   attribute or as text in the content of OBJECT).    Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style   sheets, such as graphical list bullets. Advise authors to use style sheets.   (See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document).  </proposal>    How does an author know when to do what for 3d?    An example situation.  I have a page where My Company's logo is displayed   several times.  The first use is a link to our home page.  The text content   is, "My Company's home page."  I'm very proud of how detailed we made the   logo, so I provide a longer description of it.  On the bottom of the page   we provide a row of the logos - the same image over and over again.  It's a   branding presentation effect.  The first logo has the text equivalent "My   Company" the rest have a space. I do describe the effect for my friends who   used to have sight because I think I can describe it well enough for them   to form a mental image.    This is the "extremely friendly" version.    the "basic" would be:  I have a page where My Company's logo is displayed several times.  The   first use is a link to our home page.  The text content is, "My Company's   home page."  On the bottom of the page we provide a row of the logos - the   same image over and over again.  It's a branding presentation effect.  They   all have a space for a text equivalent.    I don't see a clear algorithm for how to walk an author through the   decisions.  Ideas?    --w    At 07:15 PM 12/6/99 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Although I agree that a brief description in alt values is redundant, I would  >suggest that a longdesc is often appropriate.

        Available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/01/16-minutes.html    Short summary:  - we discussed and resolved issues with 2.1 .  - we discussed the techniques requirements.  we have a couple resolutions   of changes to make. decided to make changes, let it sit for a week, ask for   issues at next week's call and if no show stoppers publish to TR next Friday  - discussed dates for F2F at CSUN.  wendy sent options to the list for voting.  - discussed conformance logos and gregg's proposal re: conformance to 1.0   and 2.0.  gregg and jason took action items to propose text for inclusion   in conformance section.    Summary of action Items and resolutions  - resolution: checkpoint text (2.1): Ensure that all of the functionality   is operable, at a minimum, through the keyboard or other character input   device. word success criterion accordingly (will say basically the same   thing but in success criterion language)  - resolution: ensure that our use of the word content is consistent with   other guidelines.  - action editors: take use of word content to xtech (for glossary discussion)  - resolution: delete level 2 criterion.  - resolution: make addition to benefits ala wendy's proposal (ala   interpretation of comments from aaron and WWAAC folks)  - resolution (reqs for techs): replace "human testable" with "reliably   human testable"  - resolution (reqs for techs): replace "untestable" with "not reliably   testable"  - resolution (reqs for techs): replace "human evaluators" with   "knowledgeable human evaluators"  - resolution (reqs for techs): incorporate these resolutions, publish back   to list, check in with folks at next thursday's meeting, if ok, then move   forward.  - action wendy: send set of proposals (for csun f2f dates) to the list for   different votes and ask people to vote.  - action gregg: draft resolution (related to proposal about conforming to   1.0 vs 2.0) so that can be reflected in the conformance section of the   guidelines (ways of reporting and use of logo). deadline: 3 weeks from now  - action jason: draft something after gregg finishes submits his proposal   (about making conformance claims).

      Marja,    Yes, we need a tool to help keep track of issues.  The two that I have been   looking at are:    the W3C's ETA WCAG forum:   http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/issuesList.php3/wai/wcag/  (i think this is member   private...part of the reason we haven't been using it).    and the UA issue list tracker developed by Jon Gunderson.  UA results are   available at: http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html    Both of these are tied to the mailing list archives.  Do you know if   something like C-SILE would also generate e-mail to the mailing list?    Are there other suggestions for tools that I should investigate?    --wendy    At 09:07 AM 4/6/00 , Marja-Riitta Koivunen wrote:  >Somebody asked me about C-sile.

Action WC: find out why CVS keyword expansion not working in n3 files.  ?       Action SP: Take question about DAML intersection to DanC, RDF-IG or   RDF-Logic.

If split between AU and WCAG to   get techniques.  CMN There are techniques which are specific to, "how do I do this in a   tool?" This is AU TECH stuff. AU TECH will incorporate tool as well as  Action CR: Talk with Matt May about HTML Techniques to make sure all AERT   stuff being adopted there.    Implementations  DD Which CSS test suite is most current, so that can generate EARL.  WC Who's that?  DD There are several. Talking with Chris and Bert. There are 4 or 5. All by   individuals.  CMN If use the bookmarklet approach of Sean, we should be able to build one   framework and no matter which test, should fit in. Interesting to say "here   are john's tests and sean's tests, how many have I covered?"  DD Each test needs a URI that can be referenced. Annotation is good for   tracking, but need to identify what gone through.  CMN If do it by page, get worse granularity, but something. One way to   start is to take the bookmarklet and hook it up to Annotea so can collect   results. Then go through the tests and say "yes or no." Need a way for   bookmarklet to copy test in. Go to a test page, with a test suite, the   bookmarklet could be written so that click "pass or fail". then ask your   e-mail or other info or automate. add bookmarklet to browser run browser   through thing. generate a bunch of bookmarklet. What attach annotation to?   How to send it to annotea and how to get it back afterwards.  WC Need a field that will allow you to query for all annotations related to   this test suite.  CMN Query by browser string.  Action SP: Work with Annotea folks to try to implement EARL bookmarklet.  WL Is annotea persistent?  CMN It's test data so doesn't matter if it dies. For our use case we don't   need persistence.  WL Will it ever?  SP There are lots of suites that could output EARL. I was talking with P3P   people, and I might hack an example for that. Did one for UAAG - a prose   conformance statement that I expressed in EARL and sent to the group.    EARL 0.9  SP To implement need to have solid language. Need some updates, not to   many. Want to use a lot of DAML in next version. Not sure about stability   of DAML. Namespaces they use are datestamped.  CMN We and they are both doing draft vocabularies, I think we can run on   whatever we get and see. If they stabilize, we can use, if not we'll write   up the same properties.  SP Very primitive stuff in DAML that will always be in there -   intersections, equivalents, etc. Not sure about date types. Should we have   a standard date format? Couldn't communicate as easy if don't have one.   Hard to constrain strings in RDF.  DD Is 0.9 usable? I'm reluctant to release 0.95 < 1 month. I rather wait   for a couple months until we have 1.0 or implementation experience.  CMN It doesn't matter.  DD We announced to the world. We can't say we're playing with it.  SP There are some good improvements. I don't see problem making changes to 0.9.  CMN Should not change semantics in 0.9. No problem in having second   namespace out there. Need to specify equivalences. Perhaps equivalents   between 0.9 and 0.95 and say 0.95 better.  WC Better to do it sooner than later, before too many implementations.   Also, 0.9 rather than 1.0 makes it sound more like a draft.  WL So have .9oops  SP The whole point of DAML/Semantic Web is to evolve languages and show how   to translate from one to the other. There are still so many issues on the   RDF issues list.  WC Anyone disagree move to 0.95. DD?  DD Ok. Keep old schema or replace?  SP All the old examples have 0.9, make new with 0.95. New namespace.   Mapping should be in 0.9 or 0.95 schema?  WC Standard practice?  SP SWAG is to have elsewhere. If have 2 languages developed independently,   won't know about each other. Logic is that all equivalent declared by 3rd   party. But, might make sense to put in schema if you can.  WC What if someone finds 0.9, how do we encourage them to find 0.95?  SP Put a comment in 0.9 schema, or use "obsolete" so both machine readable   and prose.  WC Any resolution for us?  SP This far out there. The problem is, there are more RDF people than   semantic web people. Therefore, not a lot of best practices.  DD If we move to 0.95 we need to forget about 0.9. Perhaps people using   w/out telling us. We should make clear that if people using, they should   tell us.  WL A "current version" like documents?  DD But, it's machine-readable. Obsolete + comment. Also on home page.  Action SP: update schema  Action WC: update home page.  DD I have to leave. Still need a better tutorial. Entry stuff is not that   easy to swallow. More readable than RDF, but it assumes a lot of background   in namespace, context, subclassing, etc. Comments in example not enough.   Should we have a tutorial? Introduce schema w/explanation.  SP I started writing one. It's so basic, to introduce each point, had to   define 5 other basic points.  CMN Fair point to say how this works.  WL Earl for dummies.  CMN Right. We want pictures. Cut and paste examples. Pointers from EARL for   dummies to EARL for not so much dummies anymore.  Action SP: send EARL basic tutorial to list  Action everyone: contribute to basic tutorial.  SP Every time I want to post something, I have to find a team member to ACL.  WC Could give you access to ERT space, there is date space there.  CMN It is good to collect stuff somewhere, we have a religious commitment   to date space. ACL system basically sucks. If stuff you desperately need to   get in and link to, either get scratchpad space in ERT or be nicer to push   ACL guys to finish it, or enough so you can do own CHACL.  Action CMN: chase up ACL thing so that SP can ACL on his own.  WC Why are dates hard to use in RDF?  SP Can't have a standard date format. 2001-04-15 if next says 15 april   2001. That string used for date, should it be common between processes -   "you must use YYYYMMDD" or leave it up to the processors and let them   figure it out?  CMN Can't we use XMLSchema?  SP Possible. Not sure about the namespace. There's lots of uproar. It   doesn't have # on end. In RDF to use types, must use #. If the 2 namepaces   have any difference, not same.  CMN Why #?  SP If dereference, the data types in one document. All frag ids in one doc.   TBL argues that a doc w/out # is a generic doc. With # means any former   document. In XML Schema, no #. Therefore, going by namespace rec, the two   are not equivalent.  CMN You can't start a name with a #?  SP nope.  WL HTTP handling with # is problem.  CMN # not part of URI.  SP Resource has diff meaning in URI spec: w/called reference. RDF resource   is something w or w/out.  CMN Hack: can we declare a namespace by indirection?  SP Use something that shows namespaces are equivalent?  WC A hack b/c should have been done better, but isn't that the whole point   of equivalences?  CMN Stick as open issue, but then find out how to do it.  SP Who do we ask?  CMN XMLSchema.  WL That leaves a "meanwhile."  WC Propose to use the hack and chase up XMLSchema.  WL But isn't date conversation to avoid this?  CMN Dublin date just says "use date." dc has subclassing. believe we can   say "we're using date subtype of ISO format."  WC Otherwise, we can just say, "YYYYMMDD-TTTT"  CMN Regardless, want to type by Schema at some point.  WC Proposal: look at dc date, is there a subtype that we can use? If not,   define own. Eventually use XML Schema to define.  /* SP reads from dc */  WC Time?  SP No, generic date.  Action CMN: chase dates so know how to use them and get consistency.  /* Chris leaves */  WL I think this project of making EARL available to others is dominant one.   SP and Schlomit just had a interesting experience. She is having a hard to   fitting EARL into reality, due to N3. One thing to decide is: do we push   for N3 to become stable or expand to become real english. It is a valid   project to be connected with EARL rather than ... take some load off of   Sean. We need to produce real stuff.  CMN Do we have a canonical decision is it in XML RDF or N3?  SP I want to make sure that the syntax is as independent as possible.   People see RDF as stable and N3 as not, since RDF a Rec. But RDF has holes.   Therefore, both unstable. Therefore, need to be syntax independent, but   need to represent it somehow.  WL I propose we begin representing in English.  CMN Begin by working from the model. EARL should follow RDF model. Then in   a sytnax it works or we have an issue with the syntax.  WL We need to be able to explain it to me in English.  SP We need help from EO.  WL Perhaps time to go to them.  /* CMN leaves */  /* WL, SP, and WC go through EARL in n3 */  SP I can not get the keyword working in CVS. Just not doing it in N3. $id$  Action WC: find out why CVS keyword expansion not working in n3 files.  WL Right away, no clue.  SP Evaluation is the most basic thing in EARL. We have a list of them.   Where is says "subclasS" that means that each eval has 3 bits. An assertor   asserts an assertion.  WL Describes what an eval consists of: a statement which is a subclass of   rdf:statement.  SP Statement says "this is a triple." w/earl eval, it puts specific   properties at the ends of these. object assertor, predicate asserts,   subject assertion.  WL Making your own vocabulary. The vocab of EARL is, one word is "asserts"  SP Yes, a core property.  WL Trying to find a way to put these in a TOC item. Vocabulary, property,   ... what's best?  SP This is a data model, schema, ontology, vocabulary. In 0.9, this is not   explicit, in 0.95 I found a way to change that. Greatest hack i've every   done. Intersection of restriction of reification.  WC What is reification?  SP In EARL, say "sean says" then have another triple, "My page passes X"   like being able to put a triple inside another triple.  WC Like containing?  /* any piece of triple can be reified, or all three. they can continue to   reify infinitely. therefore subject, predicate, and object can all be   reified, and reified themselves. */  WL Like language. Something so simple in concept can look so incredible.  SP I've got no comments. No real way that you can create your own model in   RDF. In EARL we want to say a person asserts an assertion. I had to go to   DAML. Had to restrict each of the pieces of triple.  WC What has DAML done that we can'?  SP Defined terms that RDF does not.  Action SP: Take question to DanC, RDF-IG or RDF-Logic. If not getting help,   ask WC to chase up with W3C team.  SP I've asked Aaron, Libby, Seth. Aaron didn't know. Libby hasn't replied.   Steph replied to one msg not the other. Could be a simpler way of doing it   that I'm missing.  /* discussion about who doing semantic web stuff in Seattle. Discussion   about SWAG. */  Action SP: send URI to list re: SWAG archives.    $Date: 2001/05/14 15:43:18 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

      Authoring Tool WG (AUWG),  Web Content WG (WCAG WG),  and WAI IG,    The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERWG) has been working on   the Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines [1].  This document describes techniques that Web   accessibility validation tools may use to evaluate the conformance of HTML   documents to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0). This   document also describes techniques that Web authoring tools may use to help   authors modify HTML documents to conform to WCAG 1.0. We anticipate that   tool developers may develop accessibility validation and/or repair modules   to be incorporated into commercial authoring tools, validation tools, and   perhaps user agents.    The ERWG believes this document is ready to be published as a public   working draft, but would like comments from AUWG, WCAG WG, and WAI IG   before moving forward.  This document still needs work - thus it is a   working draft.  You will notice several double at-signs (@@) throughout the   document which mark open issues, questions, and other to-do's.  There is   also a list of to-do's at the beginning of the document.  We would   appreciate comments on these as well as any other comments that you may have.    This review period will end Thursday, April 6 2000.  Please send review   comments before that date to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org.

      There is an interesting article in the July 2000 Web Techniques magazine   called, "Migrating from HTML to XML."  I have not played much with the   following tools yet, but they sound interesting.    HTML-Kit www.chami.com/html-kit is freeware that is supposed to "help HTML   authors edit, format, validate, preview, and publish documents on the Web,   it has a custmoizable GUI that uses HTML Tidy to convert documents from   HTML to XHTML....Another window lists any errors and offers advice and   suggestions for improving the XHTML code.  I've found that this tool offers   a learn as you grow approach for migrating HTML to XHTML."  by Peter   Fischer, pg 52 Web Techniques, July 2000. published by CMP Media Inc.   www.webtechniques.com (the June 2000 issue is what is currently displayed   on their site)    Another tools that he discusses is called XSpLit   [http://www.percussion.com/Products/XSplit/xsplitover.htm], which is a tool   used to, "split out the content trapped inside your existing HTML documents   so that it's no longer intertwined with presentation markup.  Although a   human touch is sometimes necessary to sort out meaningful content from   meaningless markup, there are some good tools that will make your job a lot   easier....Using XSpLit, developers can easily create the XML and XSL   equivalents of their existing HTML documents without investing a   significant amount of up-front time learning XML."  also by Peter Fischer,   pg 53 Web Techniques, July 2000. published by CMP Media Inc.   www.webtechniques.com    XSpLit also seems to be free, but I'm not sure for how long, i.e. I'm not   sure if I've downloaded the actual product or a trial version.  Regardless,   the algorithms they use would apply to many of the AERT techniques.    tools to add to the list of existing tools?  --w  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Resolved: Accept Jason's edits to the WCAG 2.0 Techniques draft.  ?       Resolved: Editors (per sean's list) should begin writing techniques   using the latest draft as a model.  ?       Action MM: work on a quality control testing procedure for techniques.  ?       Scribe note: refer to "template for making techniques" submitted to   the list by lisa seeman 5 January 2001.    Participants  Katie, Wendy, Jason, Marti, Annuska, Matt, William, Loretta    Regrets  Cynthia, Gregory, Rob, Gregg, Dick    Techniques for WCAG 2.0    Background  Technology-specific checkpoints - updated 6 February 2001.  Jason's suggestions published 7 February 2001:  Merge XHTML into the HTML requirement list (only treat it separately where   issues of modularization are relevant).  Checkpoint 1.1 does not, in my opinion, apply to CSS. To what extent should   CSS be treated separately from HTML/XML?  We should think of a better term than "technology-specific checkpoint", not   only is this a cumbersome term but it invites confusion with the   checkpoints in the guidelines. I would propose instead to call them   "techniques", defined as follows: A technique is a concise statement of an   implementation strategy which satisfies one or more checkpoints. Often,   techniques are specific to a given web-related technology. In the actual   document, techniques would be sharply distinguished from the following: a.   Code examples. b. Discussion. The existing structure of the Techniques   document would be maintained--that is, there would continue to exist a set   of core techniques, together with technology-specific techniques for   (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, client-side programming (i.e. scripts), etc.    Discussion  WC Appropriate wording? Examples in a separate file.  JW Call it techniques rather than technology-specific checkpoints.  WC This be techniques and sub would be examples. Imagine a separate page   for technique, has examples, screen shots, etc.  JW Yes.  MM How cross-referenced with other technologies? What about scripts?  JW A different document for each technology?  MM Link back.  WL A database with everything. Press javascript and get everything.  JW Published as a document, each technology has its own document.  KHS Techniques for HTML, Techniques for CSS, etc.  JW If everyone agreed, then we can begin drafting them. When we come to   conformance requirements we can determine if they have a role in   conformance scheme.  KHS Calling techniques is good. Separate page is good.  JW A core that goes across technologies, like 1.0.  KHS In general think people will go to specific ones.  WC Those of you who had volunteerd to work on this, thoughts?  LGR This was the direction we were headed already.  JW Any issues regarding modularization should be separate, but the standard   usage issues should be combined.  Resolved: Accept Jason's edits to the WCAG 2.0 Techniques draft.  Scribe note: refer to "template for making techniques" submitted to the   list by lisa seeman 5 January 2001.  Resolved: Editors (per sean's list) should begin writing techniques using   the latest draft  as a model.    Until user agents  MM What are the technologies we are worried about?  JW Would you propose that checkpoints that have a choice state it more   explicitly?  MM Start with the features we are concerned about and see how to relate   those to checkpoints. 2.2 says "user agents may offer control of..." Most   do not that clearly relate a checkpoint to a specific technology.  JW It is theoretically possible that a UA offer control of it in one case   and not another. e.g. SVG vs. other graphics formats. Provides control over   for one and not another. That's the type of complexity that we need to   consider.  MM Perhaps then start with the end-user affect we're looking for. Perhaps   it's a technique. Qualifying the user agent  WC What about WML?  JW Superceded by XHTML Basic. Therefore which modules to use.  WC Thinking a lot lately about screen readers and their interaction with   browsers. Where they break the access to the web by overriding browser   support of features. Like jaws not allowing IE to link to id's.  AP - convey user experience based on which technology they are using. How   does it impact a user. e.g. space for alt-text - what is the impact for the   user. I tried out Jaws and WindowEyes, this is the information we need to   include as we move along. So, here is the technique and here is the affect   of the user.  MM Then we end up with a long list.  JW There are differences between Europe, America, ...  WC We don't have to show them every example, but some better than none.  JW Certainly.  WC I would love to see a production line. Say Matt writes a technique then   passes it to Annuska who checks it out with Jaws, then to someone else to   test with browser X, then browser Y, etc.  MM Yes. Quality Control. I have Jaws 3.5 and PWWebspeak  JW EmacSpeak  KHS Jaws 3.7  AP Jaws and WindowEyes  KHS Think of it as a matrix.  WC Also other software - scanning, reading software for reading   disabilities, etc.  JW Also screen readers that work with braille displays.  KHS We'll have to have a baseline that everyone will work towards. Do most   people use X? Should we make it work with X since most people use.  WC MM do you know about Quality Control?  MM Yes.  WC Could you help write a testing procedure for techniques? The procedure   that we use to determine if something is accessible would then be included   for others to use.  Action MM: work on a quality control testing procedure for techniques.  WC Perhaps work with ERT to develop tools to help us evaluate.

      Hi all,    This has changed quite a bit since I last saw it!  Excellent.  But, that   means I have lots of questions. <grin>    I apologize for not finishing this before the last call deadline.  I am   also not up to date on the list, and apologize if any of my comments have   already been addressed by the group or echo someone else's comments.    1.  Checkpoint 1.1  I found it very confusing to have so many special cases for checkpoint   1.1.  Parts of the checkpoint are too generalized.  I think it would be   hard to determine when it was satisfied.  Therefore, I suggest breaking it   out into X number of separate, stronger checkpoints.    2. Checkpoint 1.4  How is 1.4 different from 1.3?  1.3 is about "device independence" 1.4 is   about keyboard input.  Therefore if 1.3 is satisfied, isn't 1.4 covered?    3. Guideline 4  It is not clear in either the Guidelines nor the Techniques that font size   and changes should apply to captions.    4. Guideline 5  The 2nd paragraph of the rationale ("Some operating systems have operating   system-level flags....") isn't obviously covered by checkpoint   5.2.  Although I guess this is what "conventions" refers to.  I don't have   a suggestion for how to reword it, but perhaps this could be emphasized in   some way.  I worry that some people will never read the Techniques or   rationale and thus the checkpoints need to stand on their own in a   checklist.  Perhaps shorten the paragraph from the rationale and move it to   a Note of checkpoint 5.2.  The current note only talks about assistive   technologies, not recognizing access flags.    5. Guideline 7 - typo  The 1st bullet in the rationale is missing the word, "content."  <blockquote>  Sequential access (e.g., line scrolling, page scrolling, tabbing access   through active elements, etc.) means advancing through rendered _content_   in well-defined steps (line by line, screen by screen, link by link, etc.)   forward and backward.  </blockquote>    6. Guideline 7 rationale  The first bullet discusses sequential access and gives the example of   tabbing through links.  The second discusses direct access and says that   "context may be lost."  However, one of the complaints of tabbing through   links is that link context is lost.    7. Guideline 7 Checkpoints  7.1 says to navigate between/within viewports,  7.3 talks about navigating among the cells of a table,  7.4 says to navigate *to* active elements,  7.5 says to navigate only among active elements,  7.7 says to navigate by structure  7.8 configure structured navigation    It seems to me that we need a checkpoint that generally says, "navigate   between and within child elements of a parent."  This would cover tables   (navigate among cells), forms, and perhaps frames as well as other types of   "container" or "grouping" elements that may evolve.  It is also recursive   (thus nested tables, or tables in frames, etc. would be covered).    However, this sounds a lot like "navigate by structure" with a slightly   different emphasis.  Structure seems to refer to headers, paragraphs, etc.   rather than among the cells of a table.    7.5 seems to be a special case of 7.8 and/or 7.4.  While 7.4 seems to be a   special case of 7.8.    Therefore, in general these seem to overlap quite a lot and are perhaps not   general enough.  I do not see a clear proposal for how to make them less   overlapping or more clear.    8.  Checkpoints 8.4 and 8.5  Isn't 8.4 another attribute of a link that a user will consider when   deciding to follow a link or not (i.e., isn't 8.4 covered by 8.5)?    9.  Checkpoint 8.6  This is assuming that a user agent provides an "outline view."  I realize   that if one doesn't they don't have to conform to this checkpoint (plus   it's a p3), but does this imply that a user agent *should* have an outline   view?    10. Checkpoint 8.9  yikes!  Can we really suggest that user agents maintain consistent behavior   between releases?  What affect will this have on innovation?  I think the   issue is that behaviors may change but that the way in which Assistive   Technologies get at the information behind the behavior should be   consistent (unless there is a major innovation, e.g. the future DOM.  ATs   will have to incorporate changes, but then access should be improved   ).  Granted, it's a p3, but it might send a weird message.    11. Rationale for Guideline 9  I think it would be clearer if the first sentence read, "Changes to content   or browsing context (new viewports opening, changes in focus between   viewports) may disorient users with visual impairments or certain types of   learning disabilities." In the next sentence I would substitute "dynamic   content" for "script."    also, the use of "impariments" throughout the document ought to be   reconsidered.    12 Checkpoint 9.1  Checkpoint 9.1 - rather than providing information about events (such as   informing a user when a pop-up appears), isn't there some way to help the   user reorient themselves and change focus as well?  For example, in the   visual browser, a pop-up appears.  it doesn't say, "a pop-up is going to   appear, prepare yourself."  A pop-up usually appears to alert the user of   something. This checkpoint seems to be forcing the visual paradigm onto a   non-visual user.  Instead we ought to be looking at the function of the   visual pop-up and figuring out how that event can be translated to a   non-visual paradigm.  The way it reads now, it sounds like a   "meta-event."  It seems that the goal is to ensure that the user knows (in   the case of the pop-up) that they are being asked to do something - press   an OK button, input some information, ignore a banner ad <grin>.  I think   this is covered by Checkpoint 9.4 - let the user decide what happens when   changes occur.    13. Checkpoint 9.3  yikes - are there really form submissions being triggered by mouseovers?    14.  Checkpoint 10.1 is confusing  "Provide information about the current user-specified input configuration..."  Who are we providing the information to?  Reading the checkpoints there seems to be a mixture of "let the user know   about author settings" (which is 10.2), "let the user override author   settings," and "use the user's system setting."  Therefore, I don't see   where we are "providing information about the current user-specified   configuration."    15.  Checkpoint 10.3  In the note, shouldn't it say, "For voice-activated browsers, allow the   user to modify what voice commands activate functionalities." rather than   "self-voicing?"    16.  Shouldn't Checkpoint 10.5 be a P1?    17. Checkpoint 10.8  Why does this only focus on "graphical arrangements?"  Is the non-graphical   covered by checkpoint 10.7?    18. I found several typos, but I'm assuming others picked them up. I'll   check the next release to see if they've been fixed.    --wendy  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>

      Hello,    The ER group is working on Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and   Repair Tools (AERT) document. What do you think of the following   suggestions for where to place labels in relationship to form controls to   satisfy Checkpoint 10.2 (Until user agents support explicit associations   between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly   associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.)    1. Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes should appear after the radio   button or checkbox. For example: [checkbox] oranges, [checkbox] apples.  2. Labels for text fields appear before the text field. For example: last   name [text area].  3. Labels for groups of any form control should appear before the group.   For example: choose a city [radio button] Boston [radio button] Madison.    If this is agreeable then I will add this to the section on Forms in the   HTML Techniques for WCAG document.    Thanks  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Scott,    My response to you was, "great!  create it and we'll use it!"  I agree, if   participants on this list were more familiar with user centered design,   that would be great.  It would also be great if all participants in the   working group had a general understanding of business practices, the latest   Web technologies, professional Web design, professional Web development,   assistive technology tool development, etc.    This is why we try to invite participants with a variety of expertise so   that not everyone has to learn everything about everything.  Perhaps we   ought to have "suggested reading lists" for each of the topics that we need   expertise in.  We also need to invite experts in each of these topics.    Since we have just rechartered and released a call for participation, in a   sense we can "begin anew."  If people have suggestions of companies or   people that the chairs and I can target to get involved in the group, I   welcome all of your suggestions.    So, let's create a reading resource!  This will be helpful for new   participants who are not familiar with our work.  I don't currently have   the resources to do this myself.  Scott and Jonathan, you both seem   interested. If you create a resource, the group can review it, and we'll   link to it once it's in shape.    thanks,  --wendy    At 11:02 PM 1/26/00 , Scott Luebking wrote:  >Hi, Wendy  >  >We might not be seeing the purpose of the information in the same way.  >The original request for information came from a mailing list member.  >The purpose of the URL's that I sent out was to provide background  >information to list members about user-centered design and  >usability testing.

      actually, i suppose i am thinking of techniques for 5.1    The current techniques listed are:  Allow the user to modify the table to include row headers and/or column   headers.  Allow the user to convert the top row and/or the left column to headers.    I think we ought to suggest a mechanism that allows authors to associate   cell x with header y (axis) or row/column x with header y (scope).    This might be a technique for dealing with nested tables...??    --wendy

      Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 21 January 2001 at the   regularly scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (15:00 UTC/GMT).  To find   out what time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place on the Zakim bridge (+1 617.761.6200), conference code   3781 ("ERT-1") as well as on IRC  irc server: irc.w3.org  port: 6665  channel: #er    Note: this is a new bridge. The previous bridge did not require that you   type in a code, it automatically connected you to the call.  Note the code   (3781) that must be typed in to be connected to the call.    Agenda for Monday:    - Updates on what we've all been doing this last month.    - Sort out where it was we left off before the holidays and figure out   what's next.    - Suggestions for discussion topics?  Nick says he might have a demo of a   new tool??  Please send suggestions to the list.

      Present:  Chris, Wendy, Sean, Katie, Harvey    The call began with Twilight Zone bridge problems:  Chris and Sean were on   the call, then WC joined at 5 after but heard no one.  Chris redialed and   found WC, said he'd been hanging on the bridge with SP for 6 minutes but   got dropped.  Then SP called and said he had been on a different bridge   (yet the same that CR had been on).  Tried dialing in CMN (mobile) with no   luck.  After about 20 minutes into the call, most of us were here and it   seemed to be working.    1. AERT open issues  please agree/disagree with decision I made to move issues to one group or   another [1].  Primarily, does anyone remember issue 44 (http headers)? [2]  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Jul/0025.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-open-issues.html#44  CR agreed to respond on list.    2.  test files (from Josh and Chris)  Chris and Josh Krieger are working on test files to run evaluation and   repair tools again.  We'll then be able to compare results from files to   make comparisons of tools.  Good for gathering input for the comparison   chart I've been wanting us to complete.  These should be done two weeks from today.    3. EARL adoption  Sean is concerned about EARL being adopted.  Chris suggested that he could create a tool that would gather input from   the test files and generate results in EARL.  This will be a good test of the primer and good feedback for Sean on what   is missing or needed in the primer.  Chris and Sean will talk this week, hopefully we'll have something to look   at next week.    4. A-prompt work  Funding has run out for A-prompt. Chris will work for a couple more weeks   to tie up some loose ends and then move on to another project.  We're all   sad to see this happen. Chris says it gives them a chance to sit back and   plan where to go from here.  Will likely have more funding by January.    5. EO, comparison chart  What other resources do we need to develop to help the community with ER tools?  Chris is curious about marketing - should each tool market itself or should   ER provide a database of some sort?  Harvey thinks we should do more work with EO.  WC agrees.    6. Harvey is concerned that the UAAG conformance section makes no mention   of EARL. He sent this in a note to Ian, Ian said that it EARL is not far   enough long.  Sean had talked with Ian a couple months ago.  We at least   agreed it ought to be mentioned informatively.    7. Harvey was wondering what is happening with the WAVE?  WC said that it   sounded like the Temple folks had finally just located who was hosting the   service and that it wasn't a Temple machine.  Temple is still working to   get it back online.  Harvey asked about Kynn's offer to host. WC said to   wait to see what happens with Temple. WC will talk with Judy.      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

      oops, Len is right. the text equivalent doesn't have to be in a separate   file, it could be on the current page.  here's the fixed proposal:  <blockquote>  Technique 1.1.7 [priority 1] Verify that  text equivalents are provided for   audio files where necessary  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  If the "href" attribute of an A element is a sound file then ask the user   if there is an existing text transcript file or if a text equivalent has   been provided on the current page.  Check that OBJECT elements of type="<audio or video MIME types>" have an   associated text equivalent either within their content or an internal or   adjacent link.  Example of a message to be displayed:  Audio files require a text equivalent. Is there an associated text   equivalent for this audio file: [audio file name]?  Repair Technique:  Prompt user for text transcript of audio file.  Test Files and Discussion Files:  Link to test files for this technique.  </blockquote>    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

To find   out what time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910    Agenda for Monday:    - Where does the EARL go?  We've had a lot of discussion about how this might work. Primarily, we've   been thinking about - how does a user make use of EARL?  Some people feel   this will work more like an annotation (where content and report are   associated in an 'annotation server') others that it will be metadata   attached to content (e.g. html:link or html:meta or   html:something-else).  It seems that both of these should exist, but how   will user agents, search engines and other tools deal with them?  This   comes out of a question from the WCAG working group about how will content   authors make conformance claims in EARL.    Part of this discussion was wondering how HTML should/might evolve and what   exactly it is we would need.  There was also a lot of discussion about a   MIME type for EARL (as well as RDF). What to use now vs what might be   possible in the future.    I would like us to continue this discussion on the telecon on Monday. I   particularly hope all of you who have been participating on the list can   make the call.    - EARL 1.0  Sean published a draft schema.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Oct/0063.html  He also published a list of EARL 0.95 questions:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Oct/0040.html    - Update on implementations  The list continues to grow:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/#earl-implementations  This week Nick Kew published the address of his experimental validator that   creates EARL:  http://valet.webthing.com/xslt/    CMN and JL would like to pipe the output (currently in n3) through and   n3tordf convertor for further processing.    - Primer and support material  I was going to present to UAAG about EARL and their use of it in their test   suite development. In prep I began working on a set of slides:  http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/10-earl/Overview.html    This week I've been using this as a place to store some of the issues and   think through some of this stuff.  Still needs a lot of work, but perhaps a   place to start for some people.  I will continue to work on it in the   upcoming weeks.  Suggestions, additions, deletions, etc are welcome.    I would like to have a set of slides together for the QA F2F meeting which   is the middle of November.

      The success criteria for this checkpoint come from the XML Accessibility Guidelines (XAG) [1].  This point in particular has been edited in their most recent draft to read, "3.4 Use a device-independent interaction and events model / module. " and "3.5 Allow for user control of interaction timing - rate of change, external events triggering document changes, etc. "    Perhaps the best way to move forward on this checkpoint, is to make sure that the checkpoints in XAG are testable and then refer to them.  If not, we can work with PF to tighten up their spec.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xag    At 04:07 PM 1/22/02, Slaydon, Eugenia wrote:  ><<SC 3: I'm not sure what this success criterion means!

        Hello,    Jenae and I went through the Core Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [1] today.  Our notes are at [2].      It seems that most of the information in the Core Techniques has moved into the Guidelines/Checkpoints/Success Criteria document and the rest of the info should be expanded upon in either the Gateway Techniques (similar to the existing "Techniques for WCAG 1.0" [3]) or in each technology-specific techniques document.    Best,  Jenae and Wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-CORE-TECHS-20000920/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/26-core-tech.html  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-TECHS-20000920/    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      I have updated the charter [1] based on comments received as of today.    changes include those inspired by william (listed below) as well as:  1.  in section 10 separated "disability experts" into "research community"   and "disability community."  2.  in section 10 removed "liaison" from all but "developer community" and   qualified that the liaisons are to other W3C groups.  3. in the mission, instead of producing a "new version of" we will produce   a "revised" WCAG.  4. in the schedule, deleted the reference to the first face to face   occurring after CSUN  5. in the mission, changed "to document accessible authoring practices" to   "to document accessible techniques"  6.  in the mission, the revised guidelines are listed first rather than the   techniques.    William, I have a couple comments about your comments that we didn't   address on the call today:    At 09:25 AM 12/23/99 , William Loughborough wrote:  >I think the "Mission Statement" should say something like: "The WCAG are  >the cornerstone of the WAI effort and provide the basis on which all the  >other Recommendations depend: AU, UA, and ER." although it's heavily  >addressed in section 9, might deserve up-frontness?    hmm. what do other people think?  i don't think this is necessary, but if   people feel strongly about it we can add it.    >2.2 "documented in the Techniques document" might enjoy a better verb.    how about "addressed?"    >4 Deliverables #s 3 and 4 are implicitly contained or necessary for #2  >to have happened so might be better included in #2.    i agree with 3 (checkpoint list).  i do not agree with 4 (techniques document).  3 because it is a derivative work of the guidelines.  the techniques   document is not derived from the guidelines.    >Still think 5 is UA job - let's avoid a "jurisdictional dispute"?    we discussed this on the call.    >8 might also be considered an integral/indespensible part of 2?    minutes are part of the process, however they do require an amount of   effort therefore are highlighted.    >7.

Working   Drafts are available to the public, but have not been reviewed by the WAI   Interest Group and are not published on the W3C Technical Reports page. In   a sense these are "Internal" Working Drafts.  Public Working Drafts should be published at least every three months (per   the Release Policy). These differ from Internal Working Drafts in that they   have been reviewed by the WAI Interest Group and are published on the W3C   Technical Reports page.    >9.1 "Once PF has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier  >with a group, we need to update our deliverables as accordingly."  >grammar?    how about:  Once PF has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier with a   specification, we should reflect the new information in our deliverables.    thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000.html    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Nick,    Yes, you're right that the beauty of EARL and the real power comes from the   granularity.  You raise some very good questions, such as what about a   multi-author site?  I'm kind of thinking out loud here...    I think we're going to see a variety of situations.    1. Legacy sites that already make a sitewide claim or at least a claim   about some subset of pages will just want to make a simple claim on those   pages and not revisit each page.    2. Newer content - once tools automatically generate EARL - will   automatically generate EARL!  <grin/>  Therefore hopefully it will exist   and we can use the per page linking method as described:  ><link rel="earl-report" ...>    Or perhaps, something like robots.txt, although I think that kind of   defeats the point...but could be useful at least for search engines.    3. Tools that don't support EARL and therefore don't generate the granular   claims we find so exciting.  In this case an author will have to use their   authoring tool to produce the content then go someplace else to spit out a   conformance claim in EARL.  How likely is it that they will do this for   each page if it is not required by WCAG 2.0?  How horrible would it be if   they made a granular claim (e.g., checkpoint specific) that applies to a   large set of pages?    Back to some of your questions:    >If we just take the author's word for it, aren't we defeating the  >purpose of EARL?  I was under the impression that we were looking  >to collate comments from different sources, from the automated  >such as Site Valet to the human "I can't read that".    this is the ideal situation, but we are a ways away from that and so until   then I think we will have to take the author's word for it.  Regardless,   for the many tests that require humans to make a decision we will be   relying on the author's/evaluator's word.    >An author or QA manager can generate an EARL report on a page.  >A webmaster can define an overall site policy and (try to) insist  >everything conforms.  But this is merely like collecting Bobby stamps.  >If Granny Arthritic can't follow the feedback link for reasons the  >author has overlooked, the EARL may never be corrected.    This is true.  Although, the Bobby stamps don't provide granularity and are   not machine readable.    >I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I came out of the f2f  >with thoughts of this leading to something reminiscent of GroupLens,  >but that doesn't seem to fit with what you're describing.  >This would imply some mechanism for collecting third-party EARL  >input for any site in a centralised database - a project that could  >be somewhere on the event horizon.    Yes, the event horizon.  WCAG is looking at a conformance scheme today and   what they should require of authors.  The questions that came up:  1. do we require all conformance claims in markup?  2. how does an author make this claim - i.e. when we tell them about EARL,   do we say use the link element?  3. how burdensome and/or confusing will the author find making conformance   claims in markup?    They are good questions.  My personal answers are:    1. I would like to, but this only seems possible if all WYSIWYG authoring   tools are able to generate the EARL conformance claim for the author.  This   might take the form of a really compelling plug-in that we develop and   hand-off to authoring tool developers (or develop in conjunction   w/authoring tool devs).    2. I think the link element seems to be the best way to go.   type='text/x-earl', as you suggested Nick, works for me.  Do we need to   formalize this in some way?    3. If the tools work really well, then it won't be burdensome or   confusing.  That's kind of a big if. <grin/>    The upshot of all of this is a wonderful amount of metadata for us to   search through.  The scenarios for using it keep growing. It's very exciting!    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      let me restate my position, i mixed a couple things.    1.  i don't think we want to use headers to replace blink (or  marquee)  2.  with the span element, suggest using CSS properties.    we could then add a 3rd bullet point that includes len's comment, "The  tool shall offer the user an explanation of why CSS BLINK is   undesirable."  The "undesireableness" refers back to the HTML4 spec where   it says that css blink may or may not be supported, as gregory pointed   out.  perhaps we ought to be a bit more specific in regards to that.    --w    At 03:52 PM 10/20/99 , Chris Ridpath wrote:  >I've updated the ERT doc with the latest recommendations on BLINK.

[2.5 If search functions are provided, provide a variety of search options   for different skill levels and preferences.]    In that case then you might want to say, "provide more than one path or   mechanism to find content."  still pretty rough, but "more than one" might   be a bit tighter than "a variety."    then we could talk about the "scent of information" and the variety of ways   people navigate information.  It's like saying, "there are 5 paths to get   from A to B and people will choose a path based on which stores they wish   to pass or which park they want to walk through."    >3.X  Provide consistent interaction behaviors  >(should follow WD-WCAG20-20010125 guideline 3.1)  >  >     <glossary>Interaction behaviors</glossary> are the  >      results of user actions.

At the face to face we talked about "consistent" having two   meanings in this context:  1. consistency with standard UI design.  2. consistent usage within a site.  This ought to mentioned in the rationale as well, no?    >      ISSUE:  Should there be a separate checkpoint for navigation  >      consistency?  If so, how do we define navigation consistency?  I think navigation is a subset of navigation and therefore a separate   checkpoints is not necessary.    --w    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      The series of WCAG 1.0 Techniques documents have been published as W3C Notes.    Before publishing we made a few changes to make it more clear that there   are 4 documents and the purpose of each document.    "Four documents?" you may be asking yourself?  Yes, we moved the   "Accessibility Themes" into its own document so that "Techniques for WCAG   1.0" is purely the gateway to the other documents.  Therefore, the series   of documents includes:    Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [1] - The gateway to the other documents.  Core Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [2] - Previously the "Accessibility Themes"   section.  HTML Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [3] - HTML-specific examples and strategies.  CSS Techniques for WCAG 1.0 [4] - CSS-specific examples and strategies.    The abstract and status sections of these documents have been edited to   help clarify how the documents relate to each other.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-TECHS-20000920/  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-CORE-TECHS-20000920/  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-HTML-TECHS-20000920/  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-WCAG10-CSS-TECHS-20000920/    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      I believe this is mostly philosophical, but also has something to do with   how easy it is for the user to override author settings.  do all browsers   allow users to override FONT settings?  I thought there was an issue with   font size=x and people not being able to resize text.  --wendy    At 06:59 PM 1/30/00 , Leonard R. Kasday wrote:  >This brings up a WCAG question.

        Hello,    I am in the process of "retiring" our old issues list [1] by:  1. closing issues that have been resolved or are no longer relevant.  2. carrying forward open issues to ETA [2, 3]    As of this writing, there are still 5 issues marked as open because I am   checking to see if they should carry forward or close.    Please go through the list of recently closed issues, i.e., everything that   comes after issue #5 [4].  If you do not agree that an issue should be   closed, please let me know.    Some issues were carried forward because a reviewer's note exists in the   working draft.  I created an issue in ETA that is general: "Address   reviewer's notes."  We might want to make individual issues for each of   these, but this was a quick way to capture these for the moment.    Next, we will be updating ETA with issues recently raised on the list as   well as fixing some minor errors in the linearized ETA output [3].    Note: many of the issues currently in ETA are techniques-specific and many   of them are "to-dos" rather than issues that need discussion.  Feel free to   volunteer to work on a "to do!"

      The minutes are available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/20000504.html    I have also included them below.  Note that as I cleaned up the minutes I   found several points that needed follow-up.  Therefore, I assigned some   action items <smirk>.  These are obviously negotiable since people did not   accept them during the call. The only person who does not get off the hook   is Harvey, as he accepted the action to take a question to EO.   A few have   been "assigned" to WCAG WG in general and if everyone is supposed to do it,   no one will.  Therefore, it would be appreciated if people volunteered to   take them.    It was a very interesting call, but I'm not sure that the UA folks got all   of the answers they needed.

Since   it's during WCAG I'll go ahead. Congratulations to JG for receiving an award.  JG "Academic professional excellence award." nominated by the college.   recognition by peers through the university. did not mention accessibility.  GJR so no minority opinions then?  JG they didn't talk to any UA WG folks.  JW essentially there is a longstanding issue with structured documents. if   the document structure has been marked up correctly, one could navigate   through it. knowing where one stands and then locate particular points and   then browse the document by kinds of content. e.g. moving through an   outline to read headings in order to provide an overview of the contents of   a document. there are issues that relate to both UA WG and WCAG WG. What   markup conventions should be used for the UAs to interpret? Two fold issue:  1. what can be retrieved from DOM. connection to hierarchy and XML tree   structure.  2. use of appropriate markup so that the structure is explicit.  Al has suggested that the document hierarchy is not isomorphic to the   navigational hierarchy, at least not in all cases. We need to consider UA   capabilities and future versions of WCAG to make sure they are in synch. In   SVG one has the advantage of identifying portions of an image. Concept of   structural hierarchy and navigating it. Can apply to documents, images, and   multimedia. Jon - want to elaborate on any aspects of the issues?  JG From what I see, there is agreement that the MAP element should be used   for collection of links. My understanding is that "title" attribute of MAP   should be a label for what the group of links is. The navigation issues are   still cloudy. For example, I've got different stuff on the page. I use   speech output. I go to Yahoo - navigation bars, ads, info, that is static   and a dynamic area. When linearized, the static stuff is at the beginning.   The 2 questions I have: can we mark up the 2 areas? MAP is clear, but what   about a list of phone numbers? A New York Times article? When someone comes   to the site they have to go through all of the links to get to the new   information.  CS would changing the page title help with that?  JG possibility. more specifically, is there an easy way for people to get   to the new info?  GJR individual pages should have individual titles. using a hotkey, someone   could quickly get the title. we should have invited henter joyce (HJ) as   they have support for this. Jaws will skip over what it has run into before.  DP on a shopping site, and click "buy" it leaves you were you were so you   can continue on. it's very helpful.  GJR another thing, that both Productivity Works (PW) and HJ do, is   structured navigation. the ability to move by element or header. these are   implementation scenarios. not sure if heuristics have to do with markup or   other techniques. we ought to find out what they are doing.  JG that's my main question: is this a UA function? rather than require more   work for authors, is there sufficient info for UAs?  JW depends on if there is structure in the markup. if lists, tables, etc.   are not marked up then it will be impossible for the UA to compensate. HTML   does not encourage the use of proper container elements to designate the   scope of content. Even tho headings may be used correctly, the section to   which it applies may not be clear since there are no specific container   elements.  CS might also work to have something like tabindex for named anchors.  GJR tabindex is allowable to put in named anchors but it is not supported.   HTML spec says that A element can take accesskey.  CS i want to define where people can go. it makes sense to skip over nav if   not using it. i want them to go to ads.  GJR offering blind user same functionality as sighted user. how many people   actually read the ads?  CS if you make it easy to skip over, developers will have issues with   funding. but my issue goes beyond ads.  GJR two-fold process. the functionality could be used to skip "foo" it   could be used to return to "foo."  JP the UA could use that info in the user interface.  GJR when we had the discussion on GL re: reformatting pages with Scott   Luebking I said that would not fly. authors don't want ads on the bottom.  RS and they won't want you to skip the rest.  GJR i don't see the difference between someone who goes to Yahoo and their   brain is trained to start at a certain place. despite things beeping and   flashing, they ignore. Most people when they get to a page with a lot of   ads will ignore.  DP I browse as a disabled user, one of my favorite things, is to go to the   first field on a form. i don't even listen to anything up to that point.  CS my concern is not so much for other users of auditory interfaces, like   the car computer, people who are supplying content will want their ads to   be read. the user and the author should have some control.  GJR yes, we need to be careful. there are times when you want that info.  JW no user should be forced to read anything on a page. as a print user or   speech user they should have a choice. it should be possible to avoid or   return to particular pieces of the content and to move through the   structure as quickly and easily as possible.  GJR I am loathe to use comparisons to hard-copy print media, but when   people read magazines, there are lots of gutters on the far right column.   some people go specifically for ads, some people don't. this is obviously   an issue wrestled with in other media. We want to satisfy both sides of the   equation: skip over and return to.  CS that's reasonable. my initial point was that i'm not certain that   existing markup handles this scenario rather than trying to find a kludge.  GJR interested if the kludges that are already in effect could point us in   a direction to solve the problem.  JW where is the markup missing? DIV could be used to denote block level   content. title could be added to it for human readable characterization.  CS not saying that there are missing feature, but that we ought to explore   it. DIV makes sense. but is tabbing between DIVs supported?  GJR but we can consider it here. Al has floated such a proposal. Here is   navigation section. here is content. etc. Ads are routinely skipped over by   people who are blind because there usually is not any info. You usually get   "click here" or file size. By not assigning alt-text to areas the areas   become useless.  JW we have techniques to markup image maps and correct markup for groups of   links. i don't think we have any discussion for the proper use of DIV   elements. links, tables, forms, are there because of distinctive markup and   can be readily identified. At one level, provide appropriate container   elements (DIV in HTML, group in SVG) there is the larger issue of whether   there are cases that even if this is done the tree that occurs in the DOM   corresponds to a good navigation tree. is there a need to provide support   for navigational features. that has an impact on UA capabilities more so   than markup. question of relationships that are not reflected in document   tree that need to be represented. AG raised it in his message.  @@WCAG WG investigate the proper use of DIV.  AG want to respond to CS question. i don't see any difficulty in devising a   markup plan that would work in the UA. I suggest using things like CSS   selectors to provide a precedence order, e.g. title vs no title. This is an   area for forward motion, but hard work. Won't fly unless we can present it   to the author. The author has to care about it enough to articulate the   structure.  CS and take the download hit as well.  AG perhaps 3% character hit.  CS we have hour long arguments about adding bytes of any amount.  AG interesting. we get very different reads on this issue. history with   LINK element to provide info. but it died because authors did not use. it   was not in the default presentation of the page. it is technically possible   to use a DIV tree...i'm concerned that we take the theory of the structure   and feed it to the author.  CS keyboard shortcuts and faster navigation for power users.  AG still needs to be something in the markup to drive the keyboard   shortcuts. it takes a while to tab through stuff if you use the tab order.  JW an absolute requirement (p2 level) that appropriate markup should be   used. we need to provide examples and make the necessity as clear as   possible...  RS in the next release of UAAG??  JG If just techniques, put in techniques. we have other checkpoints related   to moving to active elements.  GJR there is a responsibility of people who rely on advertising revenue to   set up standards that the content that they pull in reformulate pages.  CS e.g. banner ads. saying it should have appropriate alt-text?  GJR yes. and the container should be marked appropriately.  AG only in the actual graph of how many hands it pushes through, it is more   removed from chief editor of the page. my scenario: go to advertiser and ad   agency. if they want to provide alt-text, that's cool. but to the extent   not informative in audio, should get out of the way in audio.  GJR easy argument to make to advertiser: you're missing people. if they're   ok with that then ok  CS there are advertisement aggregation companies. that may be where   alt-text gets lost.  GJR suggest that to EO group. we need to raise consciousness with them.  DP that knowledge would be welcome.  @@HB suggest to the EO group that they need to raise consciousness with   advertisement aggregation companies (that's one place where alt-text might   be getting lost).  JW concerned that examples have all been so HTML-specific. With this next   version we are hoping to address wider variety of technologies. What type   of structure and semantics should be provided for different types of content.  GJR we could affect great change by using XHTML as baby steps for   authors...it's XML with training wheels. increasing functionality of it.   take the power of example. do a technique in HTML. then XHTML. then port   with use of RDF to XML. we have a blueprint for people to migrate to XML.  @@GJR show what a possible blueprint migration from HTML to XHTML to XML   might look like.  JW Yes, a great idea. One of the principal ways we can develop the   relationship between HTML and XML to show how structure will be beneficial.   In a generic markup language such as HTML there is a limited range of   semantics. In this context, MAP designates an image map or a navigation   cluster of links, generic DIV while useful to capture structure does not   give semantics. There are ways to address it, one of which is to use an   attribute (class) but we don't have conventions for values to use. Or use   human-readable title. But, there are issues with capturing specific   semantics in using general containers elements. Therefore, using XHTML   module with XML defined in it, with a style sheet....techniques need to be   developed.  @@WCAG WG create techniques that show how to use XML with a style sheet.  WL encouraging the use of CSS in effect causes the author to become agent   of structure insertion.  IJ misuse of style to convey semantics. sounds like since applying style   and adding semantics wrong way to go.  JW think the argument was that when using style sheets to convey   presentation, a tendency to use proper markup.  IJ would like to be shown that that is the case.  AG that is a good candidate for the survey - to survey what is out there.  @@?? Is it the case that when style sheets are used to convey presentation   that proper markup is used? Do pages that use style sheets use more   structure markup than those that do not use style sheets?  GJR a friend filling out a tax form, did not fill out a piece of it because   it was not in bold. people have been trained to look for style. it gives   people scannability.  IJ your argument is that there are semantics in style and that's a good   thing, but that you shouldn't convey semantics first through style.  AG I would not believe WL's claim based on what comes out of word. IJ -   ideal way of doing it. making distinctions is valuable. making them in   style sheet is more valuable.  JW there is a dependency. if proper markup is used, one can reflect the   structure using the style sheet in a particular presentation medium.   high-quality visual design is intended to reflect the structure and   semantic distinctions as clearly as possible. from author perspective,   consider that the markup captures the structure properties and style sheet   will act upon the markup to create presentation that captures distinctions.   then get rich rendering in the variety of platforms you provide style   sheets for. one thing we have not addressed is to highlight the   relationships between style and well-designed markup. there is an argument   in using markup and adding style to make sure the distinctions are   expressed in presentation.  GJR need to address. one of the more common uses of style sheets - to   supplement what is there.  WL rather than beautify it.  CS because people have to support older browsers.  JW even in XML document the purpose of the SS is to provide presentation of   semantics in the markup. one should think of dependency in that way and the   relationship between good markup and high quality presentation.  HB more than one style sheets for clients. the SS should be generic to an   XML application. with recursion, the style has to handle recursive objects.   those represent significant challenges for e.g. going from braille to   visual style sheet.  AG the SS ideally are not into the specific application but into the   vocabulary of app widgets - paragraphs or toolbars. i thought that one of   the things you said was the idea that, "who are designing people so that it   shows up well is radically different media?" people are getting more   interested with phone stuff in market.  WL that's why a "C" in CSS.  AG perhaps another one for harvey. i'm interested in WAI getting as smart   as can about industry. where find people practicing what we preach.  WL WAP  JG I have some immediate concerns. Not suggesting that any guidelines be   changed, but I am hearing about bridges to new technologies, are there   things that we can use beside MAP to markup this info? how long to   resolution? 3 months or so?  JW already today, the use of container elements and structural elements is   important practice. guidelines and techniques in WCAG already suggest how   to do that. at the block level that make up macro structure of document...a   generic markup language does not provide semantics. need to use generic div   elements. use title or class to provide semantics. in XML we have more   options. I would be interested to where were people think more work needs   to be done and what issues should be settled soon.  AG there are 2 examples that have constituencies in author population. in   ISO, they require that headers have to be nested properly. if there is an   HTML page that claims it is ISO-HTML you can apply their algorithm and say   these are structural divisions. Similarly, there are few people converting   from latex that use divs. I've been reluctant to say that UA should try to   get UAs in large to do this. It would only be beneficial for small   percentage of page problems.  CS but if in the UAs more authors will use it.  AG yes, definite chicken and egg philosophy. but want mock-ups to show   authors to sell them.  @@WC find examples of ISO-HTML pages that are conformant (i.e., have   properly nested headers).  @@WC check out ISO-HTML algorithm to determine structural divisions. take   to ER WG.  JW that's authoring tools, eh?  IJ am I hearing Jon say, "tell me WCAG techniques to help UAs identify   navigable structures."  JG yes.  IJ there are 3 classes of things i can think of:  known according to spec that meet our needs (headers)  twist with some reliability (map)  everything else (div and class) poor man's way to go. correct way is with   schemas and xml. twisting html any more is not the right thing to do.  IJ it is useful to identify key components and what can use legitimately.   against twisting. want to make sure schemas meet the needs of these groups.  JW reaction to technique that says, "enclose sections of doc in a container   element with div and class"  IJ don't want to push to checkpoint level in UA.  JG not talking about checkpoints in UA.  IJ if in techniques, there's no conformance with that technique so what   will be the impact on UA?  RS anything in WCAG about your suggestion?  AG it's there in generic language. it says "structure you page well."  IJ I have been against "class=navbar"  WL this is something for people making UAs.  IJ solution is not to give them specific cases to deal with but language to   do that properly. still waiting for schemas.  GJR modularized techniques as baby-steps to HTML (not optimal)..  IJ how get any browsers to support it?  RS i don't like hacks because they break. i'd rather have a solution that   you know will work. let's work on a second one, after we get this out that   talks about XML solutions.  WL browser won't do this...maybe a screen reader will....regular UAs never   will.  CS power users.  JW if there is a requirement to traverse tree structure that will pick up   any container elements irrespective of the semantics. reading of labels on   them is up to the UA. the legacy DIV element would be supported   automatically as far as the UA is concerned. then, appropriate authoring   practices to use it. agree that generic elements such as DIV with class   attribute that has no agreed upon usage is open-ended and no way to develop   common usage patterns.  WL whatever happened to object?  IJ not well supported. not in IE5, NS6, Opera4.  AG report from HTML WG is that Object is viewed as a camel. no one was   happy with it.  GJR if we want to retain OBJECT and its power, we need to strip out   attributes that were thrown in to move forward.  AG that is continuing a thread in PF.  JW continue that in PF.  IJ seems to me that the topic that has been in UA for a while, "how should   the UA provide useful navigation and what can we get out of content to   identify them?" there have been many discussions about what is available in   markup and it seems that we end up saying, "there is limit to what we can   rely on in the spec and we need schemas." the dependency fell away and the   issue became more in the realm of UAs. given markup what functionality can   we provide. "allow the user to navigate easily to important components..."   but requires nothing special from authors. AG pointed out that just   providing nav mechanism based on spec is not sufficient. have not heard any   more about what authors can do to help UAs pick up on things. not sure we   need additional techniques.  AG what authors can do: go back to the amazon rewrite.  @@WCAG WG review AG's amazon rewrite.  IJ i have not heard any new information about what authors can do. we had a   victory with map for navigation mechanisms. have people identified other   components that we can identify with reliability with standard HTML. if   not, should we focus on ...  AG back to headers, forms, etc.  IJ yes, but that is not beyond what HTML specifies. if we are saying to UA   and authors "use specs" then nothing else to say.  AG even tho map was designated for image maps...  IJ let me get to it easily, let me skip over it, let me delve in.  JW we know that the authoring techniques: use markup according to spec, use   structural markup (e.g., DIV), use more specific semantics in markup. on UA   side: skip particular elements, read elements... if I were to suggest that   UA were to navigate through tree would it be appropriate to achieve this?   when there are relationships in markup (siblings but not in container   elements) bring doc tree in synch with semantic tree, some way to determine   structure with transformations?  AG can you focus on one question at a time?  IJ 1st question: what is the minimal requirement for UAs to provide   structural navigation?  JW not min. req. but would the option of traversing the doc tree be   appropriate way from user's perspective and UA developer to satisfy the   requirement.  RS use DOM as path to get element. within that path the user should have   option to nav by major structures. they have to be able to access all   elements in the document. as simple as that. following dom path to get to   elements. use significant elements to skip over details.  WL not just headers - everything.  Cs add accesskey to divs, spans, etc.  GJR can add to : anchors, forms, etc.  CS on DIV, does not do anything. could solve problem.  JW a kludge.  CS why not allowed.  JG can not take focus.  CS can take tabindex. it highlights. in IE5.  IJ working draft: user interface css3. some are pushed to this document.   with the "enabled" class you should be able to say that something belongs   to tab order.

      Hello,    Perhaps we should be more involved in the discussions on the   w3c-rdf-interest list?  [1]    There is currently a thread started by Dan Brickley called, "'Semantic Web   Accessibility'? - notes on XSLT and Schematron-RDF."    Has everyone downloaded and played with the Schematron?  I think everyone   should.  It raises interesting questions like:  1. instead of writing a "prose" document like the ERT, should we create a   schema (basically a set of rules) like he has already done for WCAG? [2]    2. we have talked briefly about a technique that would use RDF to keep   track of what tests a site/page has passed.  Could we build on the   schematron for this?    3. In Dan's original post [3] he says, "XSLT has great expressive power   that can be easily applied to extracting / summarising and analysing XML   web content into an RDF-processable form. Progress with this, for semantic   web and WAI efforts, might be made easier if we had some taxonomy of XSLT   stylesheets, so that an RDF agent could select appropriate stylesheets   according to task at hand."  If our tools summarized the analysis into an   RDF-processable form, then data could be shared between tools.  This has   also been discussed on the list.    Thoughts??  Ideas for discussion at the Face2face?  --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Apr/  [2]  http://www.ascc.net/xml/resource/schematron/WAI-example.html  [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Apr/0024.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Michael,    In your review you said,  "Checkpoint 2.2 - Ensure that foreground and background color combinations   provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or   when viewed on a black and white screen  New technique: check style sheet colors and cascade down to determine color   of current element."    I think this can be dealt with in the current technique.  If you don't   think it can be, could you draft text for the new technique?    thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Available at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/02/27-minutes.html    Summary    Checkpoint 2.1:  - adopt the latest proposal.  - add issue (that ben raised in the proposal) to the issues list    Checkpoint 1.5:  Judy Harkins' comments are helpful and appreciated.  action: bc pull together pieces for 1.5 and propose to list. insert flags   for issues.    Checkpoint 5.4:  - some discussion about removing reference to UAAG since didn't want to   burden users with reading and understanding. however, resolved that UAAG   provides a good structure for stating our assumptions about user agent   support. however, we should be able to state in a way that someone doesn't   have to read UAAG to understand (but can if they want to).  - resolution on this item depending on Wendy's action item to play with   UAAG conformance profiles and documenting our baseline assumptions ala UAAG.    Checkpoint 5.3  - action: wac ask ian where activex controls live. wcag or uaag?  - action: cs rewrite 5.3 by next week.    Checkpoint 5.2  - resolved:  wording already adopted in current draft.    Checkpoint 5.1  - action: lr write use case about company creating an app that uses word   and excel. we can use to help us determine what is in and out of scope for   WCAG 2.0.  - resolutions:     - editorial note #2 and #3 depend on what happens w/5.4        and not sure what do until that resolved.     - editorial note for: what does it mean in item 3 to use accessibility       features if     - leave protocol in for time being. since unsure of future.     - In Example 2, "Java program" should be "Java applet"    Checkpoint 4.1  - action: avi make edits to 4.1 (get rid of parantheses).    csun agenda thoughts?  - proposed: big elephants discussion    Proposed plan for next public draft  - wac, jw, gv, bc meet in madison 10/11 march.  - publish internal draft 14 march.  - take that to tr the following week (after csun).    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

We will be joined by the Authoring Tools   Working Group on the afternoon of the 6th.    Transportation, hotel, and meeting place information is available from:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/10/f2f-agenda.html    Once available, a link to the registration form and the agenda will be   added to this page.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      hi all,    We are due for a face-to-face meeting.  I propose March 20th, the Monday   before CSUN.   There is a room available for us at the Marriott - if we act   quickly.  Who can make that date?    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        We received several comments on the 28 August 2002 draft about checkpoint   1.1 [1].  Mat Mirabella's rewording proposal [2] was discussed at the 7 November 2002   telecon [3] and a draft accepted [4].  After that call, Mat reworked his   proposal a bit. [5]    With this progress I believe we have addressed most of the comments related   to checkpoint 1.1. However, there are a few more to discuss.  With this   email I outline six proposals to address the remaining issues.  Let's   attempt to resolve as many of the issues with discussion on the mailing   list and reserve the teleconference time for larger issues.    ===========    Comment #1  Bill Mason, 28 Aug 2002 [6]  Example 1 has a right arrow icon whose text equivalent is "Next Slide" but   the ALT tag for the image reads only "Next".    Proposal #1  Remove this image but keep the example.  Rationale: This was an attempt to include illustrations within the   guidelines themselves to help demonstrate the illustration checkpoint   (currently Checkpoint 4.2 Supplement text with non-text   content.).  However, it seems to be more confusing than helpful.    ===========    Comment #2  George Kerscher, 20 Oct 2002 [7]  level 3 currently has no criteria. I suggest: Some sites that want to   conform think they have to provide the textual information each time it is   presented. This becomes intrusive to using the site. For example, they use   a graphical bullet (image) for their lists. The image is a picture of the   corporate logo. This is described in 10 words. The user each times hears,   "This is the corporate logo showing a heart with an arrow through it."   There should be instructions that provide this information once and after   that, probably just bullet.    Proposal #2  No change to the checkpoint, handle this in techniques.  Rationale: George's proposal is a good technique.  We need to provide   better information about writing good text equivalents.  Currently (for   WCAG 1.0), this is included in Core Techniques [8] and HTML Techniques [9].    ===========    Comment #3  Mark Schult, 21 Oct 2002 [10]  Proposes to reprioritize the current items so that level 3 has identifiable   goals.    Proposal #3  No change to the checkpoint.  Rationale: The levels are clearly defined [10.5].  Balancing the load   between levels is not reason enough for us to change the priority.  At this   point, it is Ok if there are not criteria at the 2nd and 3rd level   (although we received several comments about the priority structure - a   separate issue).    ===========    Comment #4  Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 [11]  "Benefits" bullet #2: Suggest dropping this "or have it translated and   presented as sign language," the text "reading the text" makes the point.    Proposal #4  No change to the checkpoint.  Rationale:  reading text and viewing sign language are different.  In the   previous bullet we say that a screen reader can read text   aloud.  Translating text to sign language is a similar process that ought   to be specifically mentioned.  For more info, refer to an overview from   signingbooks.org [13].    ===========    Comment #5  Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 [11]  "Examples" #4: Change "described in words" to "read"    Proposal #5  Label the examples consistently throughout the guidelines.    Current wording:  Example 1: providing a short label for a button/link.  Example 2: providing a short label and a longer explanation of a data chart.  Example 3: providing a short label and a longer explanation of an animation.  Example 4: providing a short label and a transcript for an audio file that   can be described in words.  Example 5: providing a label for content that cannot be described in words.    Proposed wording:  Example 1: an image used as a button.  Example 2: a data chart.  Example 3: an animation.  Example 4: an audio file of a speech.  Example 5: an audio file of a symphony.    Rationale:  Primarily, this is a matter of style. It also improves the   consistency with the rest of the guidelines.  I prefer short labels   followed by detailed explanation to help a reader quickly skim for an   example that meets their needs.    ===========    Comment #6  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [12]  The focus of this checkpoint should be about the content, not the method   delivered. Applets and "programmatic objects" should be removed from the   definition of non-text content because they are the delivery method and are   covered in checkpoint 5.4. If applets or programmatic objects "deliver"   non-text content such as graphics, audio, or video, then that non-text   content should have a text equivalent - transcripts for audio, captions and   descriptions for video, etc. Scripts should also be removed because they   deliver content. The content delivered is what needs to be part of the   success criteria no matter how it is delivered.    Proposal #6  Change the definition of non-text content to:  Non-text content includes but is not limited to images, text in raster   images, image map regions, animations (e.g., animated GIFs), ASCII art,   images used as list bullets, spacers, graphical buttons, sounds (played   with or without user interaction), stand-alone audio files, audio tracks of   video, and video.  Scripts, applets, and programmatic objects are not   covered in this definition and are covered in checkpoint 5.4.    Rationale:  I agree with IBM's/Andi's rationale.    ===========    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/10/comments-WD-WCAG20-20020822.html#cp1-1  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0129.html  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/11/07-minutes.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0151.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0154.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JulSep/0239.html  [7] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0071.html  [8] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/#text-equivalent  [9] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#images  [10] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0075.html  [10.5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#conf-rationale  [11] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0111.html  [12] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0117.html  [13] http://www.signingbooks.org/animations/sign_language_animations.htm    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      This info gleaned from: http://interwork.sdsu.edu/ablenet/cre.html  I found this page as a link on the Blissymbolics on the Web page:   http://www.egt.ie/standards/by/bliss.html    We ought to follow these leads to find out more about the technology being   built and research being conducted about cognitive and learning   disabilities.  This is a list I compiled for myself and thought others   might benefit or be interested in following up on the leads.      3. ADAMLAB 33500 Van Born Rd., P.O. Box 807, Wayne, MI 48184 / 313-467-1415   / FAX: 313-326-2610. *ADAMLAB's agenda includes research, development,   prototyping, and manufacturing of voice output communication aids (VOCAs)   and adaptive computerinterfaces, with emphasis on the needs of the lower   cognitive functioning populations.    93. Rehabilitation Institute of Ohio Miami Valley Hospital, One Wyoming   St., Dayton, OH 45409 / 513-220-2063. *The Institute uses computers to help   brain injured individuals make maximum use of their abilities. Focus is on   cognitive and linguistic retraining using microcomputers as therapeutic   tools. Computer technology is also used with patients with high level   spinal cord injuries.    Dr. Coombs serves on a number of advisory boards including the Archemedes   Project: Center for the Study of Linguistic Information at Stanford   University; The Science and Technology Radio Project in San Francisco,   California; The University of Georgia, Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for   Rehabilitation Learning Disabilities Research and Training Center; and The   Higher Education and Adult Traning for People with Handicaps (HEATH).    <blockquote>  Educational software where the computer provides multi-sensory experiences,   interaction, positive reinforcement, individualized instruction, and   repetition can be useful in skill building. Some students with learning   disabilities who have difficulty processing written information, can also   benefit from completing writing assignments, tutorial lessons, and   drill-and-practice work  with the aid of computers. For example, a standard word processor can be a  valuable tool for individuals with dysgraphia, an inability to produce  handwriting reliably.  Input: Quiet work areas and ear protectors may make computer input easier   for individuals with learning disabilities who are hyper-sensitive to   background noise.  Software that aids in efficient and accurate input can also assist. Some   people can compensate for high rates of input errors by using   spellcheckers, thesauruses, and grammar checkers. In addition, word   prediction programs (software that predicts whole words from fragments)   have been used successfully by students with learning disabilities.   Similarly, macro software which expands abbreviations can reduce the   necessity to memorize keyboard commands and can ease the entry of   commonly-used text.  Output: Some learning disabled individuals find adaptive devices designed   for those with visual impairments useful. In particular, large print   displays, alternative colors on the computer screen, and voice output can   compensate for some reading problems. People who have difficulty   interpreting visual material can improve comprehension and the ability to   identify and correct errors when words are spoken or printed in large fonts.  Documentation: Some individuals with learning disabilities find it   difficult to read. Computer documentation provided in electronic forms can   be used by enlarged character and voice synthesis devices to make it   accessible to those with reading difficulties.

      The latest ERT is always available from: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/    The earliest that I think we can release a public working draft is 28 March.    Here's the timeline I think we are working under:  1. I will release a new working draft later today.  2. The group should review the draft in its entirety Wednesday through   monday 13 March.  3. We ought to discuss it at our 13 March meeting and decide to invite   others to review.  4. If all is well, on Monday or Tuesday (13 or 14 March) we will invite IG,   AU, and WCAG to review for 2 weeks.  5. We ought to discuss comments from IG, AU, and WCAG at our 20 and 27   March meeting.  6. If all is well, we will release a public working draft on 28 March.    I will not be able to attend the 27 March meeting as I will be traveling   home from CSUN.  I will also not be able to attend the 20 March meeting as   I will be attending the WCAG face2face meeting in L.A.  I don't think that   has to put a damper on our plans.    Perhaps we give people 3 weeks to review instead?    thoughts?  --wendy    At 02:45 PM 3/7/00 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Hi folks,  >  >the Authoring Tools group is planning to refer to the ERT document as  >covering techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines checkpoints  >4.1 and 4.2.

      Charles,    we may want to have some discussion on the ERT with the AU group, however   if you look at the list of issues we wish to cover these are addressing   basic holes in the ERT.  The list of issues are checkpoints for which we   have *no* techniques at this time.    --wendy    At 12:08 PM 4/21/00 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >Hello,  >  >it would seem to make more sense to do the brainstorming on ERT in  >conjunction with the AU group.

Rather, my question is, "what is the accessibility rationale for this   technique."  I did not see any, thus did not include any in my proposal.    I think the rationale is "good design."  Regardless of whether I choose a   high-contrast background and foreground color combination (white and dark   red), if the user only selects a foreground color (white) current user   agents will not select a high contrast background color.  They will display   the author set background color (white) and the user set foreground color   (white).  The user will have to select a foreground color as well.  In some   browsers, the user could select "high-contrast mode" where the browser   selects both the foreground and background colors.  For example, yellow   text on a black background.    >Maybe we should ask the ER or UA groups to look in more detail at the issue  >of ensuring contrast? Most User Agents allow a choice of colours, although  >most do not automatically pick a contrasting colour where there is a conflict  >or semi-specified colour scheme.    I think this is a UA issue and have CC'ed the UA working group.  Chris   Ridpath recently published results of a color study, so I have CC'ed ER as   well.  Refer to the techniques for Checkpoint 2.2 in the 26 April 2000   working draft of AERT [1].    Since there do not appear to be any objections to my proposed edit of the   CSS techniques module, I will make the appropriate changes.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast      >On Thu, 8 Jun 2000, Wendy A Chisholm wrote:  >  >   I have two questions in relation to this issue:  >   1. will user agents automatically make adjustments for background or  >   foreground color if the author specifies a good combination but the user  >   only specifies one or the other (foreground or background but not  >   both)?

      Here's from ftp://ftp.ecma.ch/ecma-st/Ecma-262.pdf    This ECMA Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most   well known being JavaScript (Netscape)  and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at   Netscape and first appeared in that  company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers   from Netscape and in all browsers from  Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.    The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first   edition of this ECMA Standard was adopted by  the ECMA General Assembly of June 1997.    That ECMA Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the   fast-track procedure, and approved as  international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The ECMA General   Assembly of June 1998 approved the  second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262.   Changes between the first and the second  edition are editorial in nature.    The current document defines the third edition of the Standard and includes   powerful regular expressions, better  string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling,   tighter definition of errors, formatting for  numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming   internationalisation facilities and future language  growth.    Work on the language is not complete. The technical committee is working on   significant enhancements, including  mechanisms for scripts to be created and used across the Internet, and   tighter coordination with other standards bodies  such as groups within the World Wide Web Consortium and the Wireless   Application Protocol Forum.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        Thinking about the fuzzy xpointer thing...    Nick, you're write-up is good. [1]  We ought to figure out how to approach people about it.  It seems to be the groups to discuss this with are: XLink, XMLSig, and Annotea.  Perhaps we can schedule a joint teleconference?    I took an action to bring this to XMLSig. I haven't done this yet.  I think some of it has already been discussed with Annotea folk.  Perhaps we can do a bit of brainstorming on this tomorrow.    --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Jul/0017.html      --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

GV Like a footnote sheet?  JW Can cross reference each other.  LG Application can define own tags and map into structure tree. In general,   we've assumed that whoever reads them understands the lang (e.g. HTML).  GV It might be good to link to something which is a write-up of PDF. A   "page description language" doesn't tell someone much.  WC What about unicode? I asked some questions.  LG If have text, need to get reliably. What does HTML do?  CS As part of windows, IE tries to download appropriate charset.  JW Provide mapping between font encoding and charset.  LG Yes that's the issue for PDF. In HTML, already in some known character   encoding.  KHS There is one that is preferred. Based on settings.  GV what's backwards compatible unicode?  ?? UTF-8  GR In css and other style langs, there are diff baselines for rendering.   some use bottom, ideographs use common, etc.  JW Where does this one go? It's an application of guideline 1, it doesn't   fit into any checkpoints. Using structure properly.  WC Anxious to see how map to WCAG 2.0 and if we need to create checkpoints   for final form languages.  GV These read more like checkpoints.  JW Checkpoint solutions.  KHS Trying to stuff techniques under guidelines.  GV Start with techniques, then identify checkpoints. We have guidelines,   under have technology-specific checkpoints (checkpoint solutions)  KHS This is checkpoint solutions  GV OK, but then need techniques underneath. extract checkpoints out into   shorter doc. e.g. provide text equivalents for image and graphis...that's a   checkpoint. if i were to do a pdf doc, i want to know what has to be true   about my document. checkpoint solutions. would be shorter and pdf doc   qualification. then techniques would say, "great, but how do it?" for pdf,   might be long.  LG Need to tell all the generation tools to use tagged pdf  WC can give them a doc like this and say, "here's what to generate."  GV "Does your tool generate PDF that meets this spec" - can help purchasers   determine which tool to buy. Please finish before june 15.  /* laughter */  KHS right, go to diff programs and make sure output is accessible.  GV People ask, "is PDF accessible?"  LG Not a good question, can only ask about any particular PDF file. If you   want to ensure accessibility, must be tagged right. Make best effort to   make readable.  KHS Let's go through these one at a time.  /* going through piece by piece */  GV When say provide text equivs, expect to see a checkpoint that says, "all   images and graphics are tagged w/xyz tag." How in PDF to you provide text   to images?  LG alt tag. it can be as long as you like.  GV a longdesc? two different purposes.  KHS title?  LG good feedback. I can feed this into process. define a new attribute.  GV Understand why?  LG We quickly get into user agent issues.  GR We need the functionality so that you can have a UA view w/pictures,   brief descriptions, or full descriptions.  GV You want that to be rich text. we need to link text w/the picture - the   whole doc is an image. Plain text not marked up.  LG Perhaps PDF not up to that. But more I can understand what we want to   do, the better I can figure a solution.  GR I'm using HTML. e.g., can mark as code or acronym. can't do that in an alt.  GV If you could allow one to embed additional pdf page as subset of pages   or link to othe rpages, then have a tagged info on pg 2. info in tag could   be pointer to another pdf page, which then is rich. but if don't want to   nest pdf then 2nd page include html  KHS What does acroboat 5 and the plug-in use for links?  LG THere are link annotations. could be a way to do this. depends on what   we want to do w/the info. link is a position on the page. can have wide   range of actions associated with it. another page, link on web, etc.  GV Can you put a link in pg 2? no, has to be tagged to an area on pg 1.  LG Attributes are extensible.  GV I want to mark up data inside of an attribute.  LG Perhaps as citation? Beyond what we can pull off.  GV What is allow HTML in content of attributes?  LG Nothing that keeps you from doing it. It's just info. Now is a UA issue,   what you do with it.  GV PDF Renderer have to deal w/it.  LG Right. won't change what visible on the page.  KHS Or link off to it.  GV Embed HTML in longdesc is tagged PDF doc. when came to picture, when AT   asks for longdesc, get HTML.then it figure out what to do w/it.  GR Acrobat reader for IE, why not an Ie reader for acrobat.  KHS WHy not link out?  GV Then have to package several documents to make it accessible.  LG Not be self-contained.  GV Is there a way to bury data in a PDF file?  CS How include graphics?  LG part of content stream.  CS do teh same thing w/markup?  LG Literally saying, "draw this graphic at this location at this size.  CS Included in the stream not a sep doc?  LG Right.  GV Can have a doc w/only images.  LG Right, when scan doc w/out OCR.  GV so, write about the alt tag. make clear how one should use it.  KHS Next: identify natural language of the doc.  GV Have a lang tag?  LG Right.  GV Use the PDF tag, but make it in format so that obviously only PDF  /* question about language. under comprehension? */  WC WCAG mapping is to "Use markup or a data model to provide the logical   structure of content."  /* debate about if this is comprehension or presentation */  /* argument that presentation since giving clue about what charset to use   and what language to speak in. */  GV Can buy that.  CS Need to add a checkpoint to guideline 1. different from the others.   Also, combine two from WCAG 1.0 into 2.0  GV Higher priority for marking up changes than marking up lang of whole   page. 508 dumped both.  GR Get verbiage from UA.  GV Put together for now.  Action GR and KHS: write proposal for new checkpoint under Guideline 1 to   handle language markup.

      Hi,    If we have two forms (which I'm not opposed to) how will a user decide   which one they want to use?  I think it will add one more step to the   process, but if it is does well i don't think it will be a problem.    One possibility:    [] I want to give a technical review of the site.  Note: knowledge of HTML   and WCAG required.  [] I want to give general feedback about the site.

      Hello,    It seems that we need consensus on the following issues:  audience  terminology  goals  layers  organization  voice and language (technical, academic, simple, or ??)    These are the types of concepts that we tried to document in the   Requirements document [1]. Therefore, can we first get some consensus on   the Requirements document?  We need to ensure that we are on the same page   here.  I think most of us feel we have consensus but could every member of   the list actually respond that they agree with everything in the   Requirements document? Or suggest changes?  Note that there are two   sections that are marked as needing work.  They are marked with @@.    Also, there is one open issue:  1. Stating assumptions of assistive technologies [REQ]  Issue  14 June 2000 - Phil Jenkins. We should document the assumptions of the   assistive technology capabilities    We still need to send this on to the WAI interest group for review before   publishing it as a note. I propose that  the working group take one more   look at it over the next week before we send it on to the IG.    thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-requirements  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Wendy    Regrets  Sean, Kynn, Charles    Testing equivalent alternative pages  CR If original page has images and alternative does not, not sure about   equivalence.  WL Depends on well the alt-text is written.  LK One page has image with alt-text, the other with all text and no images,   to compare them with a machine then probably not a need for the alternative   page. Main reason for alternative page is when original page is not accessible.  WL Which is why we have the "if all else fails" caveat.  CR Is there an example of where the "if all else fails"?  WC Flash site.  WL But we've got Macromedia on board to help make that directly accessible.   Would like to imagine there is not an example.  WC Saw an example last week where mouse rollovers provided information   through text. Had a text-only page but those clues did not show up in that   view.  WL Since most of my experience is with blind guys, their best form of   access is usually Wife1.0. Nothing compares to a human.  LK When I see a text-only page, I first check that all of the links show up   on both.  WL I would assume that tool exists. Pretty straight forward to do, right?   If it doesn't exist, it should.  CR I don't know of a tool like that.  WL Build into A-prompt?  CR Sure. What else would you look for?  WC Could have text-only branch through site in which case links would not   match between versions. Other option is one HTML page becomes 5 WML pages   since WML divide into smaller chunks.  WL Part of device independent authoring process.  WC Right, actually most transformations are not arbitrary (e.g. every 10   lines) and thus the author will indicate breaks.  WL Every transformation comes under ATAG.  LK Another possibility for EARL is to make statements about heuristic tests   that someone might have that are not part of the checkpoints. For example,   that the alternative have same links as original. Not be included in 2.0   not in 1.0, because there are valid objections, but could be something to   check for.  WL Person could then explain why images were not included in alternative   page. For example, "this page has photos of trip to bristol an amusing one   is..." I am on a list that is discussing creating a semantic web browser.   The IBM intermediary is part of the concept. So more than tracking where   you've been, but why you've been there - your schema. SWAG - semantic web   agreement group - writing dictionary of terms. It's a discussion on   e-groups that you can join. Sean, Aaron, and others are there. It's   happening very fast. It's the tower of Babel problem. You get hung up on   language rather than idea. For example people using communication boards.   They are hung up on words. Changing radically in the last few years.    Open issues  open issues list    12. Valid "longdesc"  LK Have to check the file not the pointer.  CR Check that the file is valid, that it has some text.  WL Sounds like a job for a-prompt.  Resolved: issue #12 Check that longdesc file exists and that it has some   text. Requires manual check to determine if text is appropriate description   of image.    14. Elements that might have audio  LK All kinds of things that could be audio, we would have to check APPLET,   EMBED, SCRIPT, etc because they could all contain audio. Plus anytime you   have a CGI script or anything that goes to the server, the server could   return an audio file. The proposal is that you check them all for audio.   This is the ideal tool, what may happen might be another option.  WL But its just a recommendation.  LK In AU they have to figure out what constitutes compliance. Does it just   pop up an alert box or does it do some tests.  WL What happens when you haven't bound a particular extension to a   particular rendering application? You get an error message that says   "unrecognized, how do you want to handle?" What happens when someone comes   up with something different?  LK What happens when a new mime type comes along? None of the media formats   are under W3C?  WC Right. except PNG and CMG or whatever, image formats.  LK How do we deal with formats that are not W3C but that are essential to   operation of page.  WL With realaudio, i would imagine that a huge percentage of blind users   love it.  LK Every day there can be a new plug-in on a site. A tool would have a   bunch of recognized mime type. When it sees a new mime type it flashes a   manual warning to the user.  WC Seems related to 8.1.  Agreed.  Resolved: Issue #14 Tool should flag mime types that are not part of its   base already. When new type comes along informs the user of the tool.    15. Checks for NOSCRIPT  LK In AERT NOSCRIPT is text, but can be markup. Check if what's inside   NOSCRIPT is accessible.  WL Can it be an object? an applet?  LK Check that it is valid HTML? Can only contain a block: P | %heading; |   %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV | NOSCRIPT | BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | HR |   TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS  WL Some tools put weird stuff in despite DTD.  LK Write, AOLPress insists on putting BODY in NOSCRIPT.  Resolved: Issue #15 Check contents of NOSCRIPT according to spec, i.e. only   contains a block: P | %heading; | %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV |   NOSCRIPT | BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | HR | TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS    16. Checks for ISMAP  WC Propose that add text to HTML Techniques section 7.6 (image maps) that   says, if using a server-side map as well as client-side then the   client-side is providing the text links for the server-side. Then the   checkpoint that applies is adding redundant text links for client-side   image map (priority 3).  WL How does A-prompt handle?  CR Not sure. ismap is not very common anymore.  Action WC propose language to WCAG for issue #16.  Resolved: Issue #16 is closed for us, when WCAG makes a change in   techniques send notice to AU/ER with list of changes, then up to AU/ER to   incorporate into AU/ER techniques.    26. Server-side to client-side image map conversion  CR Have map file, can convert. Sent to list last week.  LK Do we want to include the brute force method as well?  CR We looked at that, to do it properly requires many exchanges with the   server and becomes impractical.  WC Any way to request the map file?  CR Looked into, couldn't find any way to do it.  LK If they haven't done their security patches... <laughter/>  WL Or call up the author.  CR This just be for older files. Not used much anymore.  LK Input form that has a submit button. that image acting like an image   map. everytime have one of those tags should be probing to see if server   side map. Theoretically probe all image tags in an INPUT element to   determine if server-side image maps (INPUT type=image").  Resolved: Issue #26 If you find ismap and the map file is available, here   is how you can convert it to a client-side image map with usemap. If you   find INPUT type="image" then a heuristic you can use is to probe the image   to determine if it is used as a server-side image map.

Perhaps what we suggest is that rather than   replacing an unrecognized combination of characters with something else,   mark them as an abbreviation (ABBR element) and prompt the author for the   text, unless it is already in the spell checker.    I'm not sure what to suggest for the "abbr" attribute other than if a   heading has more than 3 words, ask the author if it can be shortened.  3 is   arbitrary.    --wendy    At 09:50 AM 11/24/99 , Al Gilman wrote:  >Pardon me if I put my response at the top.

      Hello,    Our new charter went into effect last week.  With this I am moving our home   page to: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/  Note that the IG and WG pages are   redirected to this new page.    Should we change the mailing list address to w3c-wai-er? All other WAI   groups have an e-mail address of that form (e.g., w3c-wai-ig, w3c-wai-gl),   but I'm not too concerned with that. It might cause more confusion than it   is worth.

        Hello,    I took an action at last Friday's telecon to draft a template for   presenters to use.  Since the presenters will have such a short amount of   time, we decided to publish brief statements by the presenters instead of   web slides.    Please provide feedback.  Are the questions clear?  Will these questions   apply to all of the presenters? Is there a question that has been left out?

      Hello,    In working on an action item for EO I've found some interesting information   about X3D conformance testing.  It's inspired some random thoughts....    The Web3D consortium, the group of people working on 3D graphics on the Web   (the evolution of VRML) has been testing both content and user agents for   conformance.    more info at   http://www.web3d.org/TaskGroups/x3d/slides/KassConformanceX3dMarch1999/index   .htm  (note that these are powerpoint slides that have been saved as images   - grrrr)    I haven't come across details yet, but the are doing some ECMA/JavaScript   testing.    NIST has a tool called Viper...NIST is also the group of people that   created WebMetrics.    Before VRML evolved into X3D, there were conformance testing tools.  Some   of which had over 4000 automated tests.    The current test suite is available from   http://xsun.sdct.itl.nist.gov/~mkass/x3d/html (NIST)    interesting piece from the documentation:  <blockquote>  The fact that a VRML scene may be static, dynamic, 3-dimensional and/or   contain sound, necessitates human visual interpretation. Consider a "dotted   line", a "green" box, a "barking" sound, all common-sense vocabulary of   human visual and audio perception. Barring exotic technology or extreme   measures, we must rely on human operators and their ability to "recognize"   these terms. To minimize the subjectivity inherent in testing browsers,   careful consideration must be given to the test file design and criteria   for evaluating the tests.    ...    By reviewing the testable areas that were apparent from the VRML   specification, we developed a model that provided some guidance in the   construction of test cases, rather than approaching these categories in an   ad hoc fashion. Three major design considerations arose from our review of   testing methodologies:  Design metafile testing using concepts derived from syntax testing, which   is realized through the development of a reference parser. The parser   should be extended to include useful graphical user interface concepts.  Design browser conformance tests using concepts derived from logical   inferencing. These concepts can be used as guiding principles for the   creation of semantic requirements and actual test case generation.  Design an interactive testing capability to address the problems associated   in testing graphics standards. The interface should make use of concepts   from other computer science disciplines, including database, WWW, and   human-computer interface technologies.  </blockquote>    It is interesting to consider.  Personally, I never thought about testing   browser implementations. I do not think that we should, yet in a way to   satisfy the "until user agents" clauses of WCAG 1.0, we almost need to   incorporate some knowledge of browser renderings into our tests.    This is obviously nothing new. Bobby already allows this by letting the   user select versions of various browsers.  Also, we have "lynx-me" type   services that allow authors to see how pages may be rendered in lynx.    just some thoughts,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello,    The debate that we had on the Evaluation and Repair Tools list (ER) was to   decide when auditory descriptions must be provided.    Ignoring the "until user agents" clause of checkpoint 1.3, it reads,   "provide an auditory description of the important information of the visual   track of a multimedia presentation. [Priority 1]."  This means that every   multimedia presentation needs an auditory description.  I am not sure that   is necessary nor feasible.  I'll illustrate this with a few examples.    1. Silent movies  Usually, there is video and the only audio is music of some sort (usually a   piano).  A summary of what has been said is visually displayed every so   often.  Is a transcript (that includes descriptions of major visual events)   enough or does a synchronized auditory description need to be provided?    2. Music videos  Music videos are visual expressions of songs.  Usually, they show the   people who have made the music, sometimes they have a story line, there is   usually lots of lipsynching and dancing.  Do they need a synchronized   auditory description?  Oftentimes the video has nothing to do with the   music.  Is a transcript (that includes descriptions of major visual events)   enough?  Is a transcript required?    Does it depend on context?  If the movie is being studied for comic timing   or how to make silent films, then is the auditory description required? If   someone who is blind is watching the movie with someone who has sight, the   person who is blind would not know when to express emotion.   On the other   hand, if the silent film is a commercial or a decoration of some sort, is   the text transcript enough?    In the case of the music video, it seems to make sense to describe   something like Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video since it has such an   involved story line.  Although I would only synchronize descriptions to the   sections of the video when there is no music but the dialog, action and   story line continue. However, I would only say this is priority 1 (must) if   the context that the video is presented in is to study the video for some   reason (music video 101).  If it's just for enjoyment (on mtv.com) I would   lower this to a priority 2 (should).    On the other hand, no matter what the context, I do not see the need to   provide a synchronized description to Sinead O'Connor's "Nothing Compares   to You" music video since it's just a close up of her face as she   sings.  If I were working for mtv.com and posting this video, I would   provide a static, text description of the nature of the video and what she   looks like, "A close-up of Sinead singing.  Her pale white face and bald   head contrast with the black background.  Midway through the song she sheds   a tear and in general looks very anguished...."    The primary question is, what is the minimum requirement that must be met   to conform to checkpoint 1.3?  Must an auditory description be provided for   every multimedia presentation?    Thoughts?  Are there other examples where the need for an auditory   description is questionable? where context may determine if it is required   or not?    I hope I have not offended anyone.  If you disagree with my reasoning, I am   obviously open to discussion since I am posting this to the WCAG list with   a series of questions and no firm conclusions.  I understand that   independent of context, people want information.  I am trying to find a   reasonable balance between what authors need to provide and what users need   to understand the content.  I believe that once we can rely on speech   synthesis to create a synchronized auditory description this will become   less of an issue.  But until then, there are concerns from authors about   cost and implementation.  If we need to push them we will.  However, I want   to be sure of the necessary requirements.

        John Slatin proposed the following rewording of example 2 for checkpoint   1.1 [1]    Providing a short label and a longer explanation are provided for  a data chart.  A bar chart compares how many widgets were sold in June,  July, and August. The short label says, "Graph of the numbers of widgets  sold in June, July, and August." The longer description identifies the type   of chart or graph, provides  a high-level summary of the data comparable to   that available from the chart or graph, and lists the data themselves.    I suggest that we accept this proposal in the next draft.

Kynn Bartlett  ?       Len Kasday  Split 2.1?  WC Refer to Kynn's proposal, my response, CMN's response to the  JW Provide consistent interaction behaviors (including navigation mechanisms).  WC My response to KB was "provide more than one path or mechanism to find   content" but does not get at consistency. Then search would be a technique   underneath this.  JW Right, so have one that says, "Provide consistent interaction behaviors   (including navigation mechanisms)" then a second one that says, "provide   more than one path or mechanism to find content" or something like them.  DB Sounds good.  AP Agree, search should be mentioned under navigation.  /* GV joins */  Action WC: incorporate these into the draft to be released next week.  Drop 2.4, user agent issue?  GV We do have situations where the author specifies a timeout.  WC Theoretically, UA could replace that with an interval the user defines.  JW Of coures UAs can solve, the checkpoint has grounds for situations where   UA has not solved. "give users control" is a code word for "if you don't   think UAs are going."  WC This is the "until user agents" coming back to haunt us. <grin/>  GV I want to see if we can avoid writing guidelines that really should be   someplace else. If the problem is that most users will want it to redirect,   don't tell authors not to, tell the UAs to provide mechanism. Forward be   done by script if script not supported not forwarded. Could defeat   auto-forward.  JW Various ways to implement. Easily avoided if using server-side   techniques or scripting techniques. UAs should fix, but I'm not sure   whether taking a requirement out since UAs should fix is reasonable.  KHS Did you read what Matt said about 2.4?  WC /* reads Matt's response */ Agrees. In ERT WG haven't figured out how to   determine that javascript is accessible or not much less how to control   parts of it. People define own functions.  JW But at least you can stop the action of it. What is not controlled by   the DOM that could be changed?  WC What about Flash or applet? General issue is "until user agent"  JW Handled by checkpoint solutions.  GV Always be the until user agents bit. Think we need to tackle it in 3   ways. Define what people need to do to make pages accessible on a   conceptual level. Then work with user agents to get them to get rid of   quirks caused by past user agents. 3rd is to create special tools, proxies,   that allow you to jet past temporary problems. Allows us to move it out.   Otherwise get ourselves in trouble when the UAs do handle them. Also don't   want to overly restrict things that people should be able to do.  KHS Don't think we can get rid of it. Important for authors to understand.  AP Agree. Since web developers will have control over, then give them our   recommendation. If the browser takes care of that's great.  GV We haven't done enough to create browser helper tools. We being the WAI,   or Trace or other universities. We ought to make a case to the government   that we say "people can't access tables since browsers don't do x." This   example problem has been solved by tools such as these. But there are many   others that haven't.  JW Agree with those propositions.  GV We didn't in 1.0 want to make sure don't in 2.0.  WC In WAI have discussed general principles then divvy up responsibility.   For example, "users should have control over timed responses." We then say,   "ideally this handled by user agents, here is what authors need to do so   that they can." However, instances where are not yet handled, then in   techniques talk about what you need to do.  GV Yes, building off of what wendy said. Some things will never be   controllable. Written as guidance under techniques.  GR 2 UAAG checkpoints "do not change content on explicit user request" and   "configure redirects."  JW Neither covers scripts.  GR Right. That was a conscious decision. It was beyond the scope of the   document. We don't have the techniques.  JW Instances with mutation events are not covered. Then this requirement   has to stay.  GR UA WG always says an authoring problem.  Action WC: rewrite 2.4 based on this discussion.  Kynn's proposal for "distractions" (cp 2.2)  WC /* reads kynn's proposal */  GV Says distractive for attractive, when all are considered attractive.   Only reason they use it is to get your attention.  JW If 2.4 refers to updating content, then aren't distractive presentations   the same as what we described in 2.4?  GV If your connection dropped.  WC reads more of proposal.  GR Proposed something to UA. e.g. configureation settings to prevent user   to have a cascade order for messages from the UA. e.g. status bar. allow   the user to say, i only want this to be used by the UA, don't let the   author take it over with a script. Either prompt me or allow it. Told that   this was a new requirement. I think it fits under orientation and   navigation. Access to the user interface.  KHS Kynn's statement about alerts is one thing, but companies can't use   that an excuse. Not just a cognitive issue, can be an annoying to anyone.  WC But that's the point of advertising. If it gets stuck in your head,   they've done their job.  GR Right, that's why suggested as a UA issue.  WC Distraction is based on how our eyes are built, which means distractions   aren't just about motion but color, size, and placement. Refer to   eye-tracking and other studies.  JW How design for cognitive disabilities.  GR New proposal by Denis to allow people to toggle elements on and off.   There might be a breakpoint where too many things might be a distraction.   Then someone can set distraction level.  GV If I set it to 5, what does that mean?  GR Want to avoid "if images are a problem, turn them all off." For some,   images are a help as long as not too many of them.  GV What if our guidelines did not prohibit anything except something that   causes a seizure. Only if a wrong or right way, only the right way to do.  JW If they want to use streaming video with no streaming equivalent...  GV If they want to, if you're going to use, you need to use captions.  GR That's in checkpoint solutions. If using streaming video...  WC I think distraction is a subset of many of the other checkpoints. For   example, color could be distracting, the author must separate content from   presentation so the user can use the user agent to make changes. In cases   of motion, this is covered by giving users control of mechanisms that   change or move.  JW Therefore, we could delete this and move forward with what wendy has   proposed. Tie these to UA in some way. Are there cases of distraction that   would not be covered. Perhaps cover individually rather than a general   checkpoint about distraction.  GV Want to go back to my previous comment, we should not prohibit   distractions, if movement etc. is what you are talking about, you should be   able to control. It is a problem for someone, everything will be a problem   for someone. There is a function to attracting attention.  JW instead of specific checkpoint, deal with it piecemeal. a distraction is   one consequence of a range of different phenomena, therefore deal with each   individually rather than the consequence of it in one place.  GV Say what to do not don't do it. We will have to document since it will   come up again.  Action WC: delete 2.2 deal with distractions piecemeal (since distraction   is a consequence of a range of phenomena, deal with each individually   rather than the consequence of it in one place.)    $Date: 2001/03/22 22:07:50 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      These are phrased as WCAG checkpoints (or techniques) rather than AERT   techniques.  To maintain consistency with AERT, they should read:  14.1.4 - Check for slang and jargon  or Verify that slang and jargon is used  14.1.8 - Check for specialized meanings of familiar words    This info needs to be incorporated back into WCAG Techniques.

        Here are some notes on changes I've made to Richard's extension of xmlspec   [1].  Also, changes between our old dtd  [2] and the xmlspec extensions [1].    Questions:  1. Not clear yet the best way to handle examples.  xmlspec has an example   element that separates a descriptive "head" element from the class of   obj.mix elements (i.e., from my understanding you could have   <example><head>...descriptive text here...</head><code> ...code here...   </code></example>)    2. I think for each technique we will have two types of examples:       1.  instructive examples mixed with            prose whose purpose is educational.       2.  examples with complete markup whose            purpose is to generate test files (ala Michael/            Chris/Josh's test suite examples)    3. I marked up a couple techniques from the html techniques [3] as I was   playing with this, but it's time to have a design discussion about exactly   what we want and how we want to model it.  (fyi: the xml of the html   techniques using the old dtd is at [4], the xml of the css techniques is at   [5], and all of these links are available from the "Development of WCAG   2.0" page [6])    ===  Old dtd compared to new xmlspec derivative.  form: was [Old element name] now [New element name]  was example now  eg-group  was explanation now description  (reusing description element rather than   creating new explanation element)  was sample/code now code (not sure this works.  trying it for now.  before   our sample elements had child code elements.  since most of the code   elements only contained code, didn't seem that we needed both.)  was name now short-name  (don't want to overload name)  was <applies-to checkpoint="xyz"/> now <applies-to><checkpoint   href="xyz"/></applies-to>  was description/rule  now rule/p  was p/see-also now see-also/p/loc  (i have some issues with this)    [1] xmlspec extensions http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/sources/xmlspec-tech.dtd  [2] old dtd http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/wcagtech020809.dtd  [3] a couple of html techniques using xmlspec extension   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/sources/html-test.xml  [4] html techniques using old dtd   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2002/html-tech-src.xml  [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2002/08/css-tech.xml  [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20.html#techs    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

        To address Roberto's comment, does anyone disagree with replacing the scope   of WCAG 2.0 [1] with:    "These guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for   making Web content more accessible. They include recommendations to make   pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of   disabilities.  In some cases something that makes Web content more 'usable'   by one person makes it 'accessible' to another.  The guidelines do not   attempt to address all usability recommendations, but  instead focus on   those aspects of usability that increase accessibility."    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#scope    At 03:03 AM 8/23/2003, you wrote:    >----- Original Message -----  >From: "Wendy A Chisholm" <wendy@w3.org>  >To: <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>  >Sent: Thursday, August 21, 2003 8:12 PM  >Subject: Minor edits to the draft charter  >  >  > >4.

[Priority 1]  Synchronize  >the auditory description with the audio track as per checkpoint 1.4. Refer  >to checkpoint 1.1 for information about textual equivalents for visual  >information.  Techniques for checkpoint 1.3  >  >Questions:  >I was trying to think how this checkpoint could be implemented  >in the user agent.        >First question is what the author actually provides when  >he provides the text equivalent of a visual track? It seems that it is  >something that can be used to create auditory description. So it needs to  >be a continuous text stream that is synchronized to the video as it is  >describing the contents of the video.    the text equivalent of a visual track is what WGBH/NCAM call "Descriptive   Video."  This is an auditory track that describes visual information during   breaks in dialog and other auditory events.   Examples are available from   the NCAM web site [1].    If it is recorded by a human, then it can be a secondary audio track or it   can be broken up into multiple files and played on cue (as with SMIL.  see   examples from NCAM's beta MagPie tool).  If it is synthesized by a machine   then the text can be synthesized to speech on cue.    >Why would someone create such a textstream? A collated text transcript  >that can be read independently from the video would make more sense to me.    I think you are assuming that the textstream appears as text and not   spoken.  If spoken, the auditory description can help a person who can't   see the video stream by giving them the visual cues they are missing.    >If a user can see text why not look the video rather than the description?    the text should be spoken because they can't see the video.    >Are there users that have hard time interpreting the video and that's why?    this will be another beneficial use, but primarily it is to be used by   people who can not see the video.    >When the device does not have a screen where to show the video it seems  >that collated text makes more sense.    yes.  there are cases where the collated text transcript does make   sense.  the future ideal is for there to be one text document and the   appropriate pieces are synchronized or synthesized on cue.    >A textstream need to be synchronized so that there is enough time to read  >it. The synchronization of the text that is visually read might be  >different for text than for the automatically created audio. So to  >automatically create an audio description based on text stream that is  >synchronized in a right way with audio might be difficult. Especially as  >the synchronization might change the timing of the original video as well  >if the natural pauses are not long enough to include the audio  >descriptions. Is there any ideas how the synchronization is created  >automatically from the textstream?    I'm not sure what amount of work has been done about this, but I know it   has been talked about.  One of the exciting things about digital   presentations is that the visual presentation could be paused during a long   auditory description.  Currently, auditory descriptions are recorded by   humans to fit during the appropriate pauses in dialog (and other auditory   events).  This often means that not all of the info is given or that it is   given much earlier than the actual event.      >Shortly: What does the author actually provide as text equivalent and how  >should the UA or the media player create the audio description from that?    the checkpoint says, "until user agents..."  Therefore TODAY, the author   has to provide the prerecorded auditory description in an additional audio   track.  In the future, the author should either provide a secondary audio   track or a text transcript with time codes.  A user agent could take this   information and send it to a speech synthesizer on cue.  This would be   similar to how SMIL presentations can currently show captions on cue.    does this help?  --wendy    [1]  http://www.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/ncam/webaccess/captionedmovies.html  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>

      The techniques document published on 11 February does include this   qualification.  <blockquote>  Provide a summary via the "summary" attribute. Summaries are especially   useful for non-visual readers. A summary of the relationships among cells   is especially important for tables with nested headings, cells that span   multiple columns or rows, or other relationships that may not be obvious   from analyzing the structure of the table but that may be apparent in a   visual rendering of the table. A summary may also describe how the table   fits into the context of the current document. If no caption is provided,   it is even more critical to provide a summary. Two examples  </blockquote>  --wendy    At 09:07 PM 2/20/00 , Leonard R.

      If this is a problem with dealing with the collections and the collections   are all about how to make things usable, then perhaps you ought to point   that out to the people who maintain the collections. <grin>    Scott, why don't you pull together all of the URLs that you've been sending   to the list and post them in one place with a bit of annotation for each   one?  We can point to this list from the WCAG Techniques document.    Looking at the collections, i think you will find that they have tried to   address the issue of overwhelming people with information.  of the two   sources that marja cited, the first, the HCI Bibliography, links to a list   of "recommended readings" divided into several categories [available at   http://www.acm.org/~perlman/readings.html]    Jakob Nielsen also tries to do some filtering by highlighting seven of his   "alert box" columns.  He also provides a "hot list" for reading that seems   categorized in easy to understand categories [available at   http://www.useit.com/hotlist/].    Another site to point out, one that Jakob refers to, is "usable web"   maintained by Keith Instone.  He has a category called "Accessibility"   [available at http://usableweb.com/items/access.html].  Perhaps someone   could work with him to massage this into a list that is most appropriate to   our needs.    --wendy    At 02:14 PM 1/26/00 , Scott Luebking wrote:  >Hi, Marja  >  >The problem with dealing with the collections is that people who are  >new to the fields of user-centered design and usability testing won't  >know where to start.

      Available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html    Also included here:    12 June 2000 ER WG Telecon  Summary of action items and resolutions  Consensus: we will focus on tools that evaluate content rather than tools   that evaluate tools.  Action: WC take to AU: we're looking at content. we're going to develop a   test suite to evaluate content. This will help AU tools evaluate ATAG   checkpoints that apply to WCAG content. If you want to include ATAG tests   in the test suites, then AU needs to do that work.  Action WC send notes to people with open action items.  Action DB: Forward info about the FrontPage Accessibility Wizard to ER. Get   more info.  Action: everyone to comment before next meeting.  Action: WC add test suite to deliverables.  Resolution: Replace the "example language" sections in AERT with link to a   tool (as an example) or to text with in WCAG (rationale).  Action WC: propose to CG that ER meets with AU, UA, and WCAG on a monthly   rotation such that ER has one joint meeting per month and 3 solo meetings.  Action WC, CR, MC, BM think more about how to save state information during   an evaluation session. Put on the agenda for the 17 July meeting.  Resolved: Next week's meeting cancelled. Next meeting is 26 June.  Participants  William Loughborough  Harvey Bingham  Wendy Chisholm  Chris Ridpath  Dick Brown  Michael Cooper  Brian Matheny  Regrets  Len Kasday  Action items  WC I had an action item from the joint AU/ER meeting: WC take idea of other   types of evaluation tools for ER. What exactly do we mean by evaluation?   Does it include evaluation of tools or limited to evaluation of content?  CR our work is based on WCAG and therefore on content and not on tools.  WC CMN made an interesting point that if AU and UA become the interest   groups for ER WG, that the division between the groups seems to be: "IGs"   create normative guidelines, ER creates tools and documents techniques.   therefore if an "IG" needs a tool they come to us.  WL Putting a tool on our list is an evaluation?  CR we put it there but not evaluating it.  WL we're not putting an evaluation in any other way.  DB Not sure we should evaluate tools. Not sure what we would base our   measures on.  WL conformance testing. We are publishing reports on authoring tools.  DB that's how it conforms to AU guidelines.  WL The only tools that we could evaluate on this list are tools that are   evaluators of themselves.  Consensus: we will focus on tools that evaluate content rather than tools   that evaluate tools.  HB valuable to annotate each of the tools as we have done.  WL We're evaluating but not rating.  CR if we're just looking at content, we do look at tools. Where does Bobby   fit in? It's not an authoring tool but it's evaluation.  WL It's on our list.  WC combining tool list with AU. therefore, bobby included in with those.  WL The question on the table is do we evaluate tools.  MC I like the idea of tool developers evaluating their own tools. If we   have a set of test pages for people to run the pages against, that will add   consistency across the evaluations.  HB We add to the suite of tests.  WL That in itself is a tool.  MC That is another representation of the AERT guidelines. We describe, this   is what a tool should do and if done correctly this is what the result of   the test suite should be.  HB Then anyone who has built a tool could contribute their test suites.  WC Are we suggesting that we will build a test suite? If so, does it   include AU stuff?  MB For AERT we are dealing with an HTML page, ATAG goes beyond that.  HB If in evaluating a document, if we could identify what tool was used to   produce it, we could report that in the evaluation of the page.  MC We've discussed that recently. The reason for doing it is that if you   discover that tool X generates alt-text incorrectly in one way, you could   easily search for tool generated problems.  HB also an AU issue.  WL Perhaps a Priority 3 guideline in WCAG to identify what tool you use to   produce.  HB However evaluation tools may strip that and insert that they created.  WC Variety of ways that they can include who created it. META, comment, or   DOCTYPE.  Action: WC take to AU: we're looking at content. we're going to develop a   test suite to evaluate content. This will help AU tools evaluate ATAG   checkpoints that apply to WCAG content. If you want to include ATAG tests   in the test suites, then AU needs to do that work.  MC Reason we use test pages rather than URIs is that URIs might get fixed   and then we'll lose our test.  WL Does Bobby use something like that?  MC in theory, yes still working on.  Action items from face2face  WC 21 action items! Many people are not here.  Action WC send notes to people with open action items.  WC accessibility wizard in FrontPage. Dick?  DB Recently seen e-mail, will forward some info on the ER. Been bouncing   around for a while.  Action DB: Forward info about the FrontPage Accessibility Wizard to ER. Get   more info.  Charter  Action: everyone to comment before next meeting.  Action: WC add test suite to deliverables.  Relationship with AU  WC reads from charter.  HB naive to think that we'll describe all of the algorithms that will be   used. What we describe are those that demonstrate what can be done not all   the possibilities.  /* silence. people want to look at off-line */  ATAG-TECHS and AERT harmonization  WC Want to point to a concrete example of how we might do this.  CR Example language is helpful.  WC Don't see how we're going to do this.  WL We're the examples for their techniques. Example language could just be   example tools.  WC What if we point to tools and say, here's what they say, or if we point   to WCAG and say here's the rationale.  Resolution: Replace the "example language" sections in AERT with link to a   tool (as an example) or to text with in WCAG (rationale).  Relationship with WCAG?  CR we're setting up a relationship with AU, should we also set up one with   WCAG? It seems very important for us to be involved in the work on WCAG 2.0  WC Has everyone looked at WCAG 2.0 Requirements doc? "2. Ensure that the   minimal conformance requirements are clear " is most applicable. Joint   meetings?  CR reluctant to increase meetings.  WC agreed. If we meet too much we won't get any work done.  Action WC: propose to CG that ER meets with AU, UA, and WCAG on a monthly   rotation such that ER has one joint meeting per month and 3 solo meetings.  Save state of information  CR when we ask a user to confirm something, like is this a table for layout   or data? Where is that info stored in the document or external?  WC Does there have to be one way or a few that are interoperable.  CR A few ways. But do we want to get into that?  WL what stage is RDF at? could we use it?  CR HTML could do that. perhaps "longdesc=""" means not required.  WL Same type of effort to make it a recommendation. That's a fundamental   addendum.  CR It will bloat everyone's document. We would encounter resistance.  WL Legacy issue also a problem.  WC Suggest prototyping to see what feedback we get.  Action WC, CR, MC, BM think more about how to save state information during   an evaluation session. Put on the agenda for the 17 July meeting.  Meeting next week  WC I am not available, Len also has sent regrets.  WL We can celebrate emancipation day.  Resolved: Next week's meeting cancelled. Next meeting is 26 June.    $Date: 2000/06/12 15:16:51 $ Wendy Chisholm  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Sean,    I got to page 7 of that article.  Way over my head at this point.  What I   got out of it is that there is a "layer problem" which I'm not exactly sure   what that means but that it originates with RDFS and is therefore carried   on in DAML+OIL (since it builds on RDFS).    Good article, I learned a lot from what I read.  Good over view of the   different layers of the architecture.    Do you  know if RDFS(FA) is being considered by the RDF groups?    Could you please explain the differences between the EARL schema expressed   in RDFS versus RDFS(FA)?    Where do MStatements, LStatements, LClass, etc come from?  What does that mean?    Also, I just realized that RDFS is a Candidate Recommendation - is that   true?  It's been there since March 2000...??  (looking through the TR page:   www.w3.org/TR/)    I obviously don't know how this would fit in with the Abstract Syntax   proposed by Jon Borden.    help...  --w      At 10:41 AM 7/10/01 , Sean B.

Via Line Number? Via added pseudo-id attribute?  MC The XPath pointing into would be preferred, the catch is that HTML does   not require the tree nesting structure is required for using XPath.   Therefore, can't use unless tool already modifying file to be more   XHTML/XML like.  WL Why not just Tidy it up?  MC Depends on if the tool is performing a Tidy utility.  LK If do have Tidy file and the XML points to the Tidied file. Need to tie   the Tidied file to the original.  MC If have sophisticated enough Tidy tool, could do that.  WL Doesn't Gerald's tool do that?  MC Don't think so. Have to look at it.  WL You can get parse view, all of the errors.  WC You mean the W3C HTML Validator.  LK Does it XHTML-ize something?  WL Doesn't change them, but gives you the errors.  MC Therefore 2 steps: tidy or not, if using XPath how is it pointing to it.   One suggestion, add an id attribute, another is to point into it by   position in doc tree. id is robust across instances. by position is not as   robust because if document modified then tree positions may change. using   id's involves rewriting code. it's less obnoxious to add an id attribute   rather than custom elements. i'm interested in non-tool specific code.  WL Philosophical decision to Tidy code before we tool it?  MC Yes, except it's probably not a decision we will want to make. Let the   individual toolmakers decide that.  LK It's the tool's business, but how do you inform the user?  CR If the document is contained w/in the evaluation doc so that it can be   recreated as it was initially. Then you can pull out just the evaluation.  MC If it will be saved with those extra elements, I'm not sure that's what   we want to do.  LK In PA it's a state regulation that state sites follow the W3C. We have   to have verification of that.  WL It's not warrantless, in general you don't go on the web and modify   their site. You're just annotating it. Unquestionably, it is best to Tidy it.  MC My response is always, "I wouldn't use that tool." I hate having my code   messed with. I would love a tool to add the "alt" text, I don't want to see   all this other stuff added to it.  LK If you like to deal with the HTML, if new id's added then you can search   to them, if they change other pieces of tags, or removed closing tags, ...   There is one class of errors that we can't mark this way, "invalid HTML."   You can't document invalid HTML after you've transformed it.  DB The FrontPage folks took pains to not modify code.  WL This is off on the side.  DB That's what they would prefer.  MC Exception that using XPath requires changing the code if not XML.  WL Could be separate.  MC If you repair something you will need a pointer to the right place to do   the repair. with XPath would have the pointer, but only to the modified file.  WL Here is ".original" and then ".copy" and that's what you modify. can   then have a side by side comparison.  MC The original won't have repairs made to it.  WL Once you've gone through what you object, then you can say, "go ahead   and change it."  DB It's fine if they are accepting it. "I accept this change." that's ok   (by user "o.k.")  LK If the user accepts change to XHTML. What if you have a user who doesn't   want it, then say sorry, can't use the tool?  WL Like grammar checker, don't have to spell a word like they request.  MC Double or nothing. either XML-ize and repair it for accessibility or do   neither. The people who want to do one but not the other are not served by   the tool.  WL If you want to change to XML, tool to do that. If want to do some   accessibility fixes without doing that.  WC Not exactly all or nothing. Should depend on the author. You can do the   evaluation but you don't have to modify the file or save the state info.  LK All alt-tags exist and correct, then someone changes the document tree.   I've lost my alt-text checks. Better to have it be as robust as possible   under editing of the pages and simple-id's does that.  WC If order changes but still have 5 images and file names are the same,   then could you assume that the order change does not affect context the   images are used in? Yes, should be as robust as possible but not everyone   is going to accept that.  WL We must always consider "cry wolf." If we don't leave options.  MC We've come up with 2 general approaches: XPath using id or position,   wrap XML tags in pieces of source.  LK Additional id attribute.  MC I aggregated that into XPath approach.  WC Two axes: XPath or wrap, separate set of files or not.  LK If you have those two set up in such a way that you can mechanically   convert from one to another, then we're just talking about implementation.   Can we map between them?  MC Agree can map between, in the XML approach mapping to the inline   approach is harder. Another axis: one session or between sessions.  LK Important axis.  MC Xpath approach easier for cross sessions w/out custom markup in page,   tradeoff if having XML-ized the original code.  LK Major dependency seems to be: who is doing the evaluation. In PA I can't   require sites to stick the ID tags in there. On Monday, I make judgements,   then they make changes, then I have to judge again. I want something that   is robust under changes. That's if I'm an outsider. If it's my code, I   would be most happy sticking in id's. Different users are best served with   different methods.  MC I've had this discussion, part of the cost of this tool is that certain   things be changed. The whole XPath approach only works for structural   features. Those that work for content don't work. Chris' approach may work   best here. With XPath all can do is point at the paragraph can't point to   features. With Chris' could mark, "this is a front-loaded sentence."  LK You can't point to the 3rd word of the 2nd paragraph? e.g. you can't   point to CDATA? Even saying that language changes, no way to point to that   word.  MC Not unless there is a "span" element on that phrase.  LK Want to ask for an extension to XPath?  MC I assume someone working on.  WC At least it will point to that paragraph and can then say "these 3   words" and the person can look for those words.  LK If you have something annotated (like chris did) it seems you could   process that to create separate document with XPath pointers as close as   they can get.  WC Combining the approaches?  LK  WC Al had good questions about Chris' approach, overlap of tool assertion   and original HTML.  MC Could say, "violation type1 = longdesc, type 2 = alt, etc." reduce   nesting of error elements. use RDF.  LK Or you could nest them. Wrap error 1 around it, then error 2. Wouldn't   matter how nest. Would be irrelevant semantically.  MC I'm seeing LK move towards saying "these 2 are equivalent" the trade   offs are different. But there are trade-offs to either one. Source code   will be modified. This is against the way current tools are working. There   is no comment format, they do things internally. There is no trade-off in   terms of modifying source. However, then can't share data with other tools.   That is a broader description of what we're talking about.  CR Can we share the evaluation data with other tools? Do we want to come up   with a common format? One tool evaluate another repair?  LK Or 2 do the evaluation.  MC And a 3rd do the repair.  LK They may duplicate or compliment each other. Could get a sum of evaluations.  MC We're wanting to answer, "yes" we can share data. trade off of modifying   source in some way. If assume perfect world (everything in XHTML) be a   non-issue. This be the case in 5 years? Perhaps be leading edge and adopt   that viewpoint.  LK Even with XHTML we can't point into text strings and if the tree gets   messed around we could add additional heuristics, but does that cover it?  WC Look at spectrum, the ideal (nested elements and XPath) to nothing   stored at all. Figure out how it breaks down based on user preference.  LK If each element has a unique id, can XPath point into that element.  MC Yes.  LK Use XPath and say, "authors, if you voluntarily put these ids in your   source and here is a tool that will do it for you, then you will have these   additional features available when you use these other tools." We stick   with XPath and we give authors the option.  WC Good to me.  MC That's how markup languages will be evolving anyway. Unique ids will be   necessary. There may be any number of transforms it may have to go through.   Adding inline elements is an extension of this approach.  WL How reduce human readability? Can you hide them?  MC Will be some gobbledy-gook. If looking for things, not sure you can hide.  WC Would be cool to see Bobby, A-prompt, and WAVE implement this and begin   sharing data between them to see how works and what issues are.  MC We could prototype. I can't promise to get it done in the next few   weeks, perhaps months.  LK Yes. The way the WAVE works now, it does something similar to put in   extra tags in namespace. It visually marks up the original markup. It wraps   things in spans and sticking in extra tags. If it were putting in abstract   tags the output would be output ala Chris or Al (if i stuck in colons to   make namespaces).  WC CR using suggested file format already?  CR We have a working version that we've been testing.  LK I could take that as an input and wind up with WAVE symbols.  CR Once you have the evaluation several ways you can present it. We've been   thinking of presentation modules: pie chart, graph, etc. Then allow the   user to select.  WC What about the other way, WAVE into A-prompt.  LK It's like screen scraping. An icon comes on, could do something that   works backwards into a-prompt. Would be better for WAVE to internally   create an annotated file then convert into WAVE-like presentation.  WC CR how do you feel about using XPath.  MC I learned it from the W3C spec. Have heard that xml.com has good stuff.  WC Also noticed new articles at webreview.com  Action CR: review XPath and XSLT documentation to see how/if a-prompt could   use XPath and XSLT.  CR Very concerned about changing code and authors not using tools if code   is modified. With embedded version, could use XSLT to produce a good   report. Can you use XSLT with XPath.  MC Yes. XPath is an integral part of XSLT.  CR We can agree that working on this standard is a good thing.  MC Easier for us to do the export rather than import. Sounds like WAVE be   the candidate to do initial import.  Action DB I'll try to get Lisa to talk to people in FrontPage and get   feedback from them.  Resolved: We will prototype sharing of evaluation and repair data between   WAVE, A-prompt, and Bobby.    WCAG 2.0  MC Generic and non-technology specific and therefore not be implemented by   the tool. Have to take techniques and line up against those rather than   guidelines themselves.  WL In principal can say that the checkpoints are machine-checkable. Do they   have the potential?  MC That sounds possible, although looking at the specific techniques will   inform that better.  WL The crafting of techniques may be affected by the notion of if they can   be machine-checkable.  LK In addition to deciding if they are machine-testable, if not, there are   ways to write a page so its easier for human judgement. If I look at a page   and different versions created by style sheets I can tell that the various   versions are the same. If one graphical the other not I have to use   eyeballs. So, not just focus on machine checkable but how easy it is for   humans to check as well.  WL The current 2.1 says "use markup according to spec" is machine-checkable.  LK Depends on what "spec" means." if "passes the DTD" then yes, if   "blockquote should not be used as quotes" then machine can't tell that.  WC Machine checkable: syntax, human: semantics.  /* discussion of classes and styles */  WL A great many of the 25 checkpoints can be tested by machine. A bit   more-so than WCAG 1.0 because being more general....do not use mechanisms   that interfere with navigation...bullets help this refresh, frames, etc.  LK Wearing our ER hats, should we recommend "do not use techniques that   will make evaluation more difficult." or a meta-principal.  WC How test? what does that mean?  LK specific techniques: you have a site that is accessible via an   alternative site. If it is the same but uses style sheets, easy to   determine. however if two generated by cgi scripts one produces images of   text the other uses text. That's hard to check. We identify practices that   make it hard to evaluate.  WC Device independent authoring workshop was all about that. Can't exclude   database.  LK If architect that so that presentation is one module at the end, then   easier to verify. But if no modules in common, then hard to verify.  WL The original thing that LK proposed is a meta-guideline that the WCAG WG   should keep in mind as they develop WCAG 2.0.  WCAG 2.0 Requirements document    Face to face  Macromedia will be there. Macromedia accessibility.  Someone from CAST. No one from ATRC.    $Date: 2000/10/30 16:48:50 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/03/15-minutes.html    15 March 2001 WCAG WG minutes    Summary of resolutions, actions, and open issues  ?       Action MM, GV, WC draft "checkpoint solutions" for XHTML based on   today's discussion of the framework.  ?       Resolved: for next draft, call Guidelines, Checkpoints, and   Checkpoint solutions at least until can discuss again.  ?       Resolved: we will meet next week. Those who can make it will   attend, those who attending CSUN send regrets. Open issues from today will   be moved to next week's agenda. Also potentially continue server-side or   ECMA/Javascript discussion from F2F.    Participants  ?       Jason White  ?       Cynthia Shelly  ?       Matt May  ?       Annuska Perkins  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Charles McCathieNevile  ?       Gregory Rosmaita  ?       Dick Brown  ?       Marti McCuller  ?       Bruce Bailey  ?       Gregg Vanderheiden  ?       Loretta Guarino Reid  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Katie Haritos-Shea  Regrets  ?       Kynn Bartlett  ?       Len Kasday    Terminology  JW List in the agenda, are there additional proposals?  ?       Guidelines / checkpoints / technology-specific checkpoints  ?       Categories / guidelines / checkpoints  ?       Guidelines / requirements / checkpoints  GV Also: Principles/Guidelines/Checkpoints  JW Right, used in earlier drafts, an objected.  CMN I objected to it. At that time it seemed like the priority label and   conformance would move from checkpoints to what was to be called   Guidelines. One thing to keep stable is what you tick off for conformance   test - those are checkpoints.  GV I agree. That's the 3rd level right?  CMN That's changed. That looked like 2nd level.  GV Not the princple/guideline lagnague, but that checkpoints you check.   Does everyone agree that what we check off is technology specifics.  /* some no some yes */  GV Does everyone agree that what we check off should be called "checkpoint"  /* no disagreement */  GV Therefore we have to agree what level we check things off at.  CS Didn't we resolve this at the F2F?  JW Yes, we resolved that technology-specific requirements would be   normative. GV raised the issue that if/when technology-spefici parts are   not adequate or if someone has an alternative means to meet the needs as   described in 2nd level, then possible to implement that and satisfy it.  GV In the TAAC and EITAAC was that we required both a functional and a   technology-specific level. The technology-specific level by itself was   insufficient. Therefore checkpoints at levels 2 and 3. Needed at both   levels since sometimes know performance want to achieve, but sometimes not   only one way to achieve. Technology-specific may not be sufficient or   necessary. You need to achieve the goal, not the specific. A suggestion:   level 1 and level 2in a document, under technology-specific we list...  CMN In AU we have the same situation. We have WCAG 1 guidelines/checkpoints   model. Checkpoints are requirement level. At techniques we say, "these are   the set of necessary thing. perhaps not the only set."  CS Not talking about techniques.  CMN In the AU example, a requirement that you do X. This expressed in borad   termas. In Techniques  GV Which is non-normative.  CMN Right. One way we think you'll satisfy is to do this set of things. If   you do all this, we agree it is satisfied.  GV Fine, but if you come back to techniques level...right, that's how in   WCAG 1.0...going back to what is normative is you don't have objective   being something checked off, get into mess if bunch of ways to solve. May   not want to write all the ways of doing it. One suggestion: carry the level   2 down so that in technology specifics, have objective, then any   technology-specific ... under have technology-specific which you must do on   your way to meeting the general level 2 objective.  CMN By not having that 3rd level, we are able to say "this is sufficient   way of satisfying" and then "here is another sufficient way."  GV Not suggesting 3rd level was not normative.  CMN Problem arise if have 2 methods.  CS We have "use alt-text" it is technology specific. It is required. It   needs to be normative.  CMN No, not normative.  GV why?  CMN It's an example.  GV This is why in the guidelines we had level 2 and 3 being normative.  WL The word "normative" and concept "technology-specific" there is an idea   that these are mutually exclusive.  CS If you are using HTML, you must use alt on image.  CMN wcag 1.0 checkpoint 1.1. to satisfy, write about image somewhere else   on the page. it's not particularly helpful or friendly. go down checklist,   at p2 level, implement w3c specs. for html, says put alt in. If you havne't   done it the right way pass Level A, not Level AA.  GV Should have failed Level A. That does help people connect image and   description.  MM how apply to link image?  CMN Don't meet first level requiremnt of replacing the function. We might   be complicated our lives.  GV The interesting thing you raise is...sometimes we make laws based on   what we've done in the past. it anchors us in form over function. if the   goal is to have info in alternative form, but that they know they have it.  WC /* reads from draft of technology-specific checkpoints */  CMN Need to be more explicit about binding between requirments and   technologies. If we try to take a document through Recommendation process   and say we have semi-normative requirements, it will have to be clear how   you conform.  CS The technology-specifics make it more clear. "what do you have to do?"   is not clear in WCAG 1.0. Our spec is different from the HTML spec.   Techniques are not normative.  GV Two key words: necessary and sufficient. Checkpoint. List underneath:   ways to satisfy. If alternatives not checkpoints. If I have these listed,   some may be necessary, then be checkpoints. A dn Bwill satisfy but are not   sufficient. It's not clear what is not necessary vs. what is sufficient.   Can list combination. e.g. to meet "fruit cocktail" I can pick A or B or C.   A is banana or pear, B is banana or raspberry. etc.  JW That's the structure that CMN has been sugesting. That each statement at   the technique or technology-specific level should make clear which are   alternatives and which are sufficient and which are ncessary. in addition   to 1.1 of 2.0 guidelines, in HTML requirements it would have a vlid   attribute of an image element is one alternative. if object it must   containt text content. each is conditional and each sufficient. in other   cases may have more complicated situations in which case need to implement   A, or B, and C or somethig. Open questions, should that level of   specificity be normative.  CMN The first alarm is that we say "do this by providing an alt attribute."   There are other valid ways of doing it. Some of them come about by   fulfilling other checkpoints. In writing techniques, is more explanation of   why it satisfies it. The more I talk with people the more I think we are   not going to create an exhaustive list...  BB Do people like the escape clause in 508?  CMN "You have to provide the function:  GV Equivalent facilitation says, you don't have to follow guideline if you   provide the function.  CS Right, but I am arguing that technology level is normative, is that some   developers only look at normative documents.  GV Sufficient aspect - make usable without hearing, vision, etc. don't have   the slightest idea.  CMN There will always be another way to meet the erquirement.  JW In next technology-specific draft it should be clear that under each   requirement, which is sufficient.  GV I'll describe what I think I heard people describing. We have level 1   and level 2 items, in one document. Then 2nd document, contains all levels.   have "ifs" ifs not requirments. "if you have an image, then you must do one   of the following." underneath have a, b, and c. each is a sufficient   package in that technology to meet it. the last item is always "or   equivalent." Techniques doc could document other alternatives over time. At   bottom end of list, "and anything else needed to achive the objective." in   some cases we will not be able to name a specific technique.  CMN I feel like I"m at the same place as GV. As much I spend my life   saying, "the last driver of this is law" i am coming at this from a   legalistic point of view. We create as much info as can. The first run is   "here is how we would do it with some explanation as to why this meets the   technique." It might be the combination of 3 steps. Some people can say, "   I just want to do it like they recommend." then they can be done. over time   with WCAG 1, we've had a lot of questions, "does this meet the requirement   or not?" we've had to agonize over some of those. As a WG,. an important   role that we fulfill, when someone needs "is this enough or not." we say   yes or no with reasoning. Then we write that down so that people can   reference that in the future.  GR Middle of road proposal, similar to GV's. Add something to conformance   structure that says, "in order to claim conformance you must explain how   provided functionality, in a public place." show that it works.  GV You mean whenever someone claims "or equivalent" they must document it   publiclly?  GR Yes. Feedback to the group will help us.  JW As public as the web site is.  CMN Important function of WG to either say "yes that's valid" or to include   in list of techniques for others to use.  WL Should call techniques.  GV Call them sufficiencies.  WL That flies in face of normative.  JW Implementation strategies.  WL Agreed that checkpoints can't be there.  MM Strategies sounds great.  CS All of these are non-normative terms. Developers will ask where the spec is?  GV When generating a standard, defining a particular way, e.g. RS232. If   create RS232 here is how you create it, but you don't have to create.   However, don't always need to use a serial connection, could do B or C.   Trying to get people one of several ways.  CS That's why divided by technologies.  GV If you do it, do a certain way.  CS Why can't that be normative?  GV says must do one way.  CMN no, you can have options in normative.  GV The trend is to get people to do things the same way.  CS It's the rule. It's the norm. Level 2 at managers, Level 3 at   developers. They have to know what to do.  MM YOu have to think of the developers as an extension of the tools. They   are not who bought into it (those are managers) they were directed to do a   task. They could care or not if this helps people. But they need a document   that says, "here is what you do." That's where having a normative document   makes it possible for those who are providing the effort.  GR Then need a per element info. That will be large.  MM When I mentioned "Design principles" where we say "read this" if you   tell them "this is what you should do, must do, to retrofit, to etc." if   you tell them "learn this" it's the same as saying "learn XHTML by reading   the spec." a compliance tester will not be able to do these things.   techniques and rationale important to have in head of developer.  CS I'm not arguing shouldn't have but have at a different layer.  GR Deal with each language separately.  MM Yes. Take the things that can be defined for a compliance checking tool   - that's a desired goal.  GR A lot of work.  CS It's work that we need to do.  CMN Necessary but not sufficient. Harder piece: do you do something of this   nature? e.g. when talking about image maps, diff between image map and   image button. in mind of developer who asked teh question, there is a clear   difference as to what they do. We need to describe that in functionality   not pointy brackets.  CS There are two levels here: click on image to make something happen   (level 2), different ways to type angle brackets to do x. can't say image   map, they'll think map element. need code examples for all.  CMN Testing is key. "This is the test we'll apply to your page."  DB We have taken "techniques" that were "strategies for meeting   checkpoints" and saying that are required.  CS no. this is the terminology problem. We are taking technology-specific   checkpoints that we have factored out of existing checkpoints for specific   technologies.Making some set normative. NOrmative in WCAG 1.0 but included   at top level.  DB Things in examples, none of those were techniques? those were checkpoints?  CMN We're building a 4th level. It seems that we are not sure if we want 4   levels or if we want 3 levels and how many levels should be normative   requirements and which informative. Top level don't effect final outcome,   except help understand lower levels. Seem to make levels 2 and 3 normative.  JW We have agreed for a while that we would have technology-specific   requirements that would be formulated in teh way we've been suggesting.   Does anyone disagree that these levels should contain in relation to each   technology and layer 2 checkpoints a specific indication of what is   sufficient and necessary. e.g. if you use x you should do a b or c. Other   issues: what levels are normative and what do we call them?  GR We grappled with this in UAAG. The UA has to expose things that the   author puts in. The current term is "required optional content." We're   trying to explain what is required, e.g. in the case of IMG it is alt=""   what is required is what goes in there. Have a paint by numbers.  DB I want to see this in a draft.  WL Me too.  JW concerns regarding GV's proposal?  CS My concern is that it mixes data aimed at manager and data aimed at   developer into same document. should split. what we currenlty call   checkpoints are aimed at manager, level below is developer.  GV Level 2 are checkpoints. under those have conditionals and under that   checkpoint solutions.  WL Doesn't that make it a checkpoint?  JW checkpoint solutions or implementation strategy or whatever you choose   to call it.  CS Want to see conditionals and other below in a separate doc.  GR That could evolve.  JW Must be possible that some other means of meeting checkpoint must be   availablve.  Action MM, GV, WC draft "checkpoint solutions" for XHTML based on today's   framework.  Resolved: for next draft, call Guidelines, Checkpoints, and Checkpoint   solutions at least until can discuss again.    Next week's meeting  Resolved: we will meet next week. Those who can make it will attend, those   who attending CSUN send regrets. Open issues from today will be moved to   next week's agenda. Also potentially continue server-side or   ECMA/Javascript discussion from F2F.    $Date: 2001/03/15 22:45:32 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Before publishing a new working draft I need to add an abstract.  What do   people think of this:  Abstract  This Working Drafts is the first step towards incorporating feedback   received on WCAG 1.0 since its publication in May 1999. Primarily, this is   the first attempt to write checkpoints that may be applied to a wider range   of languages and that may be understood by a more varied audience.   Since   this Working Draft builds on WCAG 1.0 it has the same aim: explain how to   make Web content accessible to people with disabilities.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Present: Chris, Katie, Sean, Harvey, Wendy    Summary:  - SBP will create 1.0 schema with changes he sees should be made to make it   easier to use. He will show the differences between 0.95 and 1.0 and create   some examples.  - SBP Will also send thoughts about a canonical version of EARL to the list.  - We decided to meet every other week instead of every week.  - Our next meeting is 29 Oct 2001.  - CR will send info about the meta info in the test files to the list.  - WC is putting together slides for the UAAG mtg next week that could also   be used at the QA meeting to educate people about EARL.      EARL 1.0    SBP Yes, RDF.  TestMode seems to be in the wrong place. e.g., if you want   to say that you manually validated a page, then put that in the   testCriteria bit.  Think it belongs in a statement by itself. When the page   is passed/failed, it is a manual test.    HB Any way to standardize assertions of a manual test? If manual, subjective.    SBP Good point. In other words, why need the info anyway?    HB We need it, but we need to give guidance on how it can be used.    WC Important for conformance. e.g. "as clearly and simply as   possible."  Need to know if person just "think it is" or ran a fog index on it.    HB if text equiv makes sense.    WC That's where test specification languages come in.  CR, what if move to   1.0 right now?    CR Fine to me. Not sure if current EARL that ATR generated is correct. How   do we determine if it is correct?    SBP I wrote an RDF validator in May that could be used to check   schemata.  Should be able to play with to see if EARL is correct or   not.  Libby argued that canonical form of EARL would be easier for people   to follow.  Easier to follow DTD than schema.    WC Really like idea of validator. What takes to get it into a canonical form?    SBP decide  on structure. subset of RDF.  mainly aesthetic.    CR Could we have 1/2 dozen examples of how it could be used?    SBP that would be useful.    CR Implementations?    WC http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/#earl List of tools we want from F2F. Including   Nick Kew agreeing to work on Site Valet. How's that going?    SBP Well.  There's a message in www-archive.      Test Spec Languages    WC CR - your own dialect for test files?    CR Yes. Certainly need human readable results from the tests. It   fails/passes because of...    SBP For EARL you need a URI for a test, like CR's test files have a URI.    HB Meta info, such as dublin core, good to expose if it is present on   docs.  Buried info, not part of WCAG assessment. Good meta data.    SBP In the schema for dublin core, have info in a comment rather in schema.    WC DTD for test file info?    CR no, i'll explain.    Action CR: explain meta info used on test files and dtd.      Test suites    WC DOM working on test suite. UAAG also.  I'm attending mtg next week.   Thoughts and questions?    HB EARL is an unknown in UAWG.  I've encouraged them to use it.  Not much   has happened.    WC Will create a mini EARL tutorial slide set to use, first test will be   with UAAG WG.  Part of ongoing action item to work no primer.  If we get   this to work for UAAG, then should have a tool can be used for DOM suites   or others. Pass along to QA.      QA F2F    WC    CR Just machine readable      Meeting schedule    Next meeting 29, going to every other week.      SBP What about 1.0?    HB Is it a final thing?    SBP It's the first of final. Nothing to stop us to going to 1.0.    HB What about 0.96?    SBP Have status that it's not really ready yet.    WC Have you heard that?    SBP Not sure, maybe just CMN    WC Sounds like you have several ideas about this already. How long would it   take?  I'd be interested to see what it looks like.  Particularly, if the   differences were explained.    Action SBP propose 1.0 schema. Show differences between 0.95 and 1.0 and   examples.  Action SBP write up ideas about canonical form of EARL.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Gregory,    These 2 checkpoints are P3 because providing a summary or header   abbreviations make it "easier" to get the info from a table.  If an author   does not provide a summary or header abbreviations, it is not making it   "impossible" or "difficult" to access the information in a table. UNLESS a   summary is so well written that a user would not need to access the   table.   Therefore, I could see upgrading "summary" to P2 for complex   tables, p3 for others.  Headers I still see as "helpful" i.e. they decrease   reading time and annoyance (based on the current WCAG use of the "abbr"   attribute and not ABBR element.  ABBR issues are handled in checkpoint 4.2,   also a P3).    Yes, authors should be encouraged to provide as much semantic information   as possible.  The WCAG prioritizes that info based on how well it can help   the user access the information, in this case we are refering to the TABLE   element.  Summaries and table header abbreviations do not help access   nearly as much as appropriate structure, identifying headers, etc.    unless you can prove me otherwise...    --wendy              >At 07:22 PM 12/15/99 -0500, Gregory J.

Action Daniel: Talk with Sean to find out how we could help with phone issue.    Agenda  Posted 15 December 2000 by Len Kasday    User Scenarios  LKUser Scenarios. First scenario: The user is a person writing an   evaluation for a site. It's a 3rd party evaluator. /* Len reads from the   User Scenarios page */ Item 1.  WL Similar to what people like Kelly Ford do. This would regularize the   process.  AG One pod in a scenario with 3 activities.  LK Item 2: combine output.  HB Implication on running tools in same presentation environment? The same   user preferences set in the user agent? Part of the evaluation? Running   with Lynx, may have different reactions and propose different repairs.  LK Are you saying that when you run a tool, there would be setup parameters   like "assume this capability in the browser." This relates to a WCAG   discussion.  HB My suggestion is that we need to capture the user's environment from   which they are making the observations. Even how using the tools.  BM The test tool should always put relevant info into description.  WL Yes, and that the environment is relevant.  BM For later on analysis? As long as that is recorded, then up to combiner   tool to bring together.  AG A genuine quality factor for the data. How much of that environment is   capturable.  BM Need more examples of what is relevant.  AG Good to capture and good to automate.  BM Yes.  AG But separate issue from combing input from different tools.  LK HB Could you give examples of a couple different environments?  HB No specific cases. Concerned that Gregory running a tool might have   different insights that we would not get if we're not using the same ATs   that he is.  AG Why people put different text in alt-text: someone using Lynx versus   someone using Netscape. Lynx inlines while Netscape puts it in a box. In   Netscape, click on the text you get the image. Therefore in Netscape you   put description of image while in Lynx causes people to write functional.   Therefore, helps to automate as much as possible. You might want info about   the tools that were used and the settings.  LK Another aspect: if you run a tool and it identifies tests that were not   passed. e.g. WAVE does fewer tests than Bobby or A-Prompt it would be   useful to have indication of the scope so you know what the tool could have   potentially checked.  HB That's a profile of the tool.  LK That would be a subcase of what HB bringing up. That will give info of   the environment.  AG This relates to my new scenario. "3 box nature" and "examples". How do   you recognize pages where the rule applies? Can we come up with an XML   query that will bring back a good example? There is a database that for a   given WCAG or AERT reference it can give you samples. Gives evidence of how   A transforms gracefully and how B does not.  LK How fit into EDL?  AG It's a record of an evaluation. This is a reference database that a   webmaster uses when someone complains. To answer "what do I do about it?"  WC This is something WCAG working on. Are you saying that it should EDL to   express these?  AG It is one example.  LK All EDL do is point to checkpoint not explicitly to example. Are you   saying that EDL points directly to example?  AG You're operating from an assumption of scope. I'm saying that what WCAG   is doing with the database is an application.  LK I.e. stop thinking about EDL scenarios, these are user scenarios. An EDL   plays a part of but not whole picture.  AG What is the value added? That's what trying to answer.  LK It may turn out that no additional functionality is needed to do this,   but a tool that uses EDL could follow second-order pointer. That's one   implementation.  WL I've been working on "How people with disabilities use the web." It   points into the curriculum. It has demonstrations of just about every   checkpoint. It is easy to reach into. How many other things like that exist?  WC WCAG working on a database of techniques.  AG That is an area natural for WCAG to call on ERT. The concept of the   database is like the curriculum. We've got XML Schema coming up. The piece   that keeps me interested, is how do I go up on the Web to find similar   pages to what this rule is talking about. How do I find comparable pages.  HB Some tool was sniffing through lots of pages. It could address some of   our issues.  AG That logic could be used differently. The WCAG database is an example of   what I'm saying.  WC Clear that WCAG is a user of this. What other need to say now?  AG Content developer and web experts not the same people. 3rd activity is a   hands-on evaluation by someone with a disability. Those are 3 activities.   What are the communication mechanisms between them? Content developer   likely not to look for examples, but webmaster could provide.  Action LK: change the intro of user scenarios to broaden scope.  Action LK: Add a scenario related to examples.  Action LK: Add a scenario where a person is doing hands-on, usability testing.  AG Mike Paciello has convinced Fidelity to make their site accessible.  Action AG: send discussion of overlap between database WCAG working on and   EDL work.  WL Has anyone talked with anyone with W3C geek-world about what we're doing?  AG PF.  LK Daniel will go to the Amaya folks about whether they would input/output EDL.  DD Yes I can ask. Although it's not an evaluation tool.  AG But it's an annotation tool.  WL The inclusion of these features in an authoring tool is useful.  LK Once we do that the whole thing shifts to AU.  AG We're close to where we were a couple years ago. We talked about   pointing into a broken document. This is saying one of our capabilities is   a universal diff so that people could ingest changes. Then user could see   propose "after" and accept or not.  LK Does the annotation capabilities have a diff capability?  WC Not needed, not changing anything.    Al's OOP proposal/example  AG The basic relationship is that it's a generic to specific relationship.   A generic evaluation method that's been applied. Recording app of some   evaluation method. The specific evaluation has a specific subject, what   evaluating. other ref info says how eval. what conclusions come to.  LK What we see here (the pseudo code) does this come up for each test? or   is there a header?  AG This is info, you query a test, and get info back. You have 3000 errors   of 17 kinds in the report language build structures that incorporate   reference to, this is the page i was on, etc. in terms of info   requirements, this was not in compliance.  LK You could say, "AG says these things" or "AG says A", "AG says B"   informationally the same.  WC test definition - get at how we were pointing into applications? like   authoring tool?  AG It could be a natural english description of how get circumstance or   pointer into son-of-AERT database in which queries and transforms that   describe a technique. the reference is to something and it has a broad   range of types. Only thing defined is the role and its relationship to what   we add.  WC inheritance?  AG I've tried to sketch an info graph, at the infoset level. If you make   this an XML language then you may point to test definition you may be   referencing either an ID that the author put in xml or auto-generated node   id that some XML to infoset algorithm generated. There is a numbering   scheme in infoset. Then you point to eval record with this id. we see this   in svg. the way you incorporate is by reference, if someone thought about   referencing that item. we prefer ids over paths, but can use paths as well.   that's inherited from xml environment. just an abstract link. The test   method has an abstract statement of input and output. The test method tells   you the type of result. "go/no-go" or prose paragraph. Core application of   EDL doesn't define types of results those are imported from test definitions.  WC you did not sketch that out.  AG Where I say "includeByRefinement" generic to specific relationship   between what refered to and what here. in the instance of an evaluation,   the result must conform to type definitions.  WC TestFormal Ref vs TestActualRef  AG Generic don't know identity of what evaluated. formal: place holder.  WC an example?  AG /* VHML pins on chip vs places on board actual vs formal references.*/   defn of test has generic info about what is touched during test, to   complete test must identify them. what was the actual viewer i was using to   make this comment.  LK Accessibility web examples.  AG actual (specific): point at image element, ends in .gif flunked refering   to actual string that is attribute of specific reference. formal (generic):   path through the syntax, the text which forms the "alt" attribute of   any/some instance of the HTML element type IMG.  LK EDL would not give go/no-go that would be inherited from the test   defining. What if the test defn written in prose? In something that is not   EDL? How be inheritance?  AG That's a type. We may develop additional vocabulary. If you tried to   reverse engineer AERT, this is a subtly that escapes manual, could be part   of EDL core. That may be one built-in attribute. I see this as putting a   couple modules together. There is core that integrates. Forget about doing   automatically, that would be suitable property to apply to that test   description. if it's just natural language prose, you could annotate that.   "forget trying to analyze." build a filter, how much manual eval am i   willing to put into. do one search for "what can i automate" for results   then "what are the test methods" then filter according to other rules.  WC so, saying this is just how to pull different pieces of the evaluation   record together.  AG Look at what people doing, not just what does the format do in there.   We're still looking for boundary on scope. The key thing is, what do   different activities have to tell each other. Then you take the different   scenarios and mix/match and normalize. The experts are a separate community   - ask librarians about dublin core. human factors ask about why this fails.   there are some things we define as glue to pull together. my OOP sketch is   at level of "how to we build something that supports the info map to   support communication between scenarios."  LK Do we have that captured in minutes or have AG post to list.  Action AG: comment on minutes to make sure ideas captured appropriately.  HB Anytime that one tests a site, one must test particular URI. Many have   changing content, therefore evaluation at one point differ from later point.  WL They are 2 different things.  HB But have same URI.  WL The analysis is of a particular instance of that.  AG May need to provide a copy of some dynamic sites.  WL Consider machine as user.  Action WL: propose user scenario where machine is user.  AG Some more thoughts: As we try to gather mind around task, the user   scenarios are good to state objectives. At the same time, good to survey,   which resources can we build on. Sean clearly has finger on RDF as finger.   Daniel look at Amaya for prototype - what is the minimum stuff to build for   a working model. Charles prolog script is another example of something we   could use to play with to say have we identify the functionality we need or   might have missed. What are existing examples that come close that we can   benchmark requirements against. HB's issue send me back to WART - what info   do they capture?    Next meeting  Resolution: No meeting next week due to Christmas Day.  Action LK: confirm with AU that next joint meeting is 2 January.  AG To nominate something for the agenda, ask what their desires and   constraints regarding an evaluation description such that they could use   it. Likewise, repair description.    $Date: 2000/12/18 16:42:01 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

        Hello,    At this a.m.'s techniques telecon we talked about use cases for the   printable version of the checklists (although the use cases seem to apply   to checklists in general).  We came up with three uses of the WCAG 1.0   checklist [1] based on our experiences:    1.  user: developer  task:  reviewing site, making notes in table cells. go back to checklist   on-line. but no way to fill out on-line.    2. user: evaluation and repair tool developer  task:  making the eval tool do what the checklist does. uses the checklist   as a guide to determine if the tool covers everything.    3. user: 3rd party evaluator  task: evaluating a web site.  since they are not the developer and perhaps   not technical, may answer some of the checks "don't know" if they don't   know the intent of the elements.    What other guidance can we give people when they are trying to determine   conformance?    The User Agent Working Group published "How to evaluate a user agent for   conformance to UAAG 1.0" [2] which includes a series of steps in prose.   They also published a checklist for UAAG 1.0 [3].    The Education and Outreach Working Group published "Getting Started: Making   a Web Site Accessible" [4] and "Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility" [5].    Other resources:  WebAIM's checklist for 508 [6] and tutorials [6.5].  IBM's checklist [7]  NCAM's guidelines [8]  Dive Into Accessibility [9] sorts tips by person, disability, design   principle, web browser (includes some assistive technologies), and   publishing tool.    There is a lot of other great work out there, this is just a small sample   to spawn some discussion.  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/10/eval  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/uaag10-chktable.html  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/  [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/  [6] http://www.webaim.org/standards/508/checklist  [6.5] http://www.webaim.org/howto/  [7] http://www-3.ibm.com/able/accessweb.html  [8] http://ncam.wgbh.org/cdrom/guideline/  [9] http://www.diveintoaccessibility.org/    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 16 July 2001 at the regularly   scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find out what   time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910    Agenda for Monday:  - Quickly go through the  updates to the AERT open issues list, per the   note I sent earlier today. [2]  I have not passed any of these on to WCAG   or AU yet, nor integrated them into the WCAG issues list.  What I propose   is that we get the issues divided, then send notes.  I'll let WCAG   determine if they/how they want to incorporate the issues before adding   them to the list.    - EARL Primer. Discuss proposals from last week.  Perhaps new proposal   before Monday's meeting? [3]    - Future work: Tool comparison and documentation for users.  At the Coordination Group call last week we talked about the role of the   ERT WG in relation to other WAI groups.  There was discussion that ERT   might collaborate with EO on some documentation.  For example, developing   the list of existing tools.    To determine if there is some need that we could helpful fulfill, could we   brainstorm about what needs people are aware of?  I know people want tools,   but I think they want a process as well - a clearer idea of what tools to   use when.    What kinds of tools should we try to encourage people to develop (and   obviously they should all be encouraged to produce EARL).    I don't want to shake our focus from finishing EARL and getting existing   EARL implementations, but I thought a general discussion about where the   group is headed would be interesting.    Be well,  --wendy    [1] http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Jul/0025.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Jul/0020.html      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

        In the update for jaws that Roberto sent [1], it says, "You can even use   the Dictionary Manager to replace words with sounds or play a sound, as   well as change the pronunciation of a word. You can also tell JAWS to   always speak a particular word in a particular language. Imagine replacing   a left pointing arrow symbol with a sound which plays from the right ear to   the left. All this power is available just by selecting the appropriate   speech and sounds scheme or by using the more powerful and flexible   Dictionary Manager."    in this morning's call [2] we said we would define ascii art as multi-line   ascii art, but dash dash greater than is not an emoticon and it is not   multi-line ascii art but it is a symbolic representation created out of   characters.    so, 2 points:  1. is the definition that we agreed on this morning accurate?  2. jaws users are (or will be) able to add common "symbols" to their   pronunciation dictionary which answers a question we asked in the call.    --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JulSep/0338.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/2003/08/20-wai-wcag-irc.html#T14-39-34    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

How does Annotea handle documents that change. Part of relationships   between docs?  Are the re plans to annotate annotatiosn?  How do you avoid annotation spam? A robot plastering advertising on popular   web pages.  Are there annotations that are structured? Something other than freeform text?  Accessibility of Amaya?  No meeting next week (16 April)    Participants  ?       Chris Ridpath  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Harvey Bingham    New Tools  LK WatchFire  WC Also at CHI, lots of marketing about DiamondBullet.    ATAG tool  LK Anything else for this a.m.?  WL Mattias created an interface for the ATAG TECHS doc. Think we ought to   think about interfaces for all our docs. Interfaces like WAVE and A-Prompt   and less like W3C are something we should look into.  LK What do you mean?  WL The miles of boilerplate at the beginning.  WC Don't think we can get rid of the boilerplate, but stuff after that...  WL Put a "d" at the top that links to all the boilerplate in the world. Not   everyone needs that.  /* looking at Mattias' interface to ATAG Techs */  WL Showing the kind of tool he is used to. It makes the other document   something you can get into. It's like my checkpoint checker, but from a   different point of view. where you make assertions based on checkboxes,   could be converted to EARL (the manual check part).  LK It has a bunch of questions, are these 1 to 1 correspondence with   requirements?  WL Not sure. We'll ask him at the meeting. This idea is persuasive. Just   wanted to address the issue that some of these things can be done within   our own bailiwick.  LK This is an example of a tool which instruments a document by having an   external checklist which will link to the document itself.  HB Don't see any way to quantify that i've done 1/2 the images. Aren't we   putting our assessments on documents as well as tools.  WL Have a different left frame when working with document rather than tool.   If we're evaluating authoring tool accessibility not sure dealing with the   documents it produces.Still thinking of it as a mock-up of a prototype.  HB Very interesting.  WL Some people hate it. Unless you have more than one view, you don't have   enough.    Annotea  LK Let us read the pages then comment on it.  /* Introduction slide 2*/  LK it's attaching comments as well as processing them. They talk about a   query language like SQL to pull things out of it.  HB Premise: not altering original document, but letting people know   annotations exist.  WC Annotation server, set permissions on annotations. Configure to load   annotations from various servers .  WL It would be neat if the W3C site was as fast as google.  LK It would be useful for this to run on something other than a W3C server.   To put it on another server, what do?  WC Don't know.  /* Underlying Architecture - slide 4 */  /* Annotations are Statements - slide 5 */  /* Annotation Schema - slide 6 */  LK At the F2F RS talked about this. they just havfe a simpler way of doing   it. Creator of statement is just another attribute of the statement.  HB Lots of potential attributes. For the document, you wouldl ike to know   the creator. For the annotation you would like to know the document   version. Date is not necessarily an adequate surrogate.  LK The property annotates. We asked if it points to a URL or URL+version.  WL If the document goes away, it's annotations go away?  HB Who owns the annotation, the annotator?  WC That's issue with dated URIs. Pro is that annotate to dated URI means   that for future versions it may not apply. Con, is that what if it does   still apply?  /* discussion about inaccessibility of this slide presentation as well as   Amaya */  HB Re: spam, you might have some filtering based on author.  LK A signature as a solution.  WC You can filter by author, by server, and by type.  LK As far as authentication, who made the annotation, the filter by author   is good as long as can authenticate.  WL Therefore prohibit anonymous, who is responsible for some of the world's   best quotations.  LK Are there annotations that are structured? Something other than freeform   text? If so, then EARL is just an application.  WC But they are RDF.  WL They make RDF out of someone saying "I hate this."  LK These are EARL requirements stated as questions.  WL Is it an activity?  WC It's a project. Marja is the lead. The home page has more info,   including contributors and how to set up a server.  WL What is the review?  WC Don't think there is one.  LK PF would be the only one to do it. Currently, WAI is reviewing mail   archives. Who is leading this?  WC Judy I imagine.  LK Amaya is a similar thing. Sounds like there is not a formal way of   reviewing things that are not recommendations. Part of R&D activity.  WC hadn't thought about. Mostly thought about stuff outside of W3C, but yes   this and Amaya are R&D.  LK who wants to infiltrate the www-annotation mailing list?  /* everyone already subscribed to too many */  Action LK: Post these questions to www-annotation, post pointer to WAI-ER.  How does Annotea handle documents that change. Part of relationships   between docs?  Are the re plans to annotate annotatiosn?  How do you avoid annotation spam? A robot plastering advertising on popular   web pages.  Are there annotations that are structured? Something other than freeform text?  Accessibility of Amaya?    Next meeting  WL and WC send regrets.  next week is cancelled.    $Date: 2001/04/09 15:28:16 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      hi all,    In case you missed the October 21 teleconference, or have not read the   minutes [1], the people on the call determined that before our charter   expires at the end of the month we need to:  1.  Restructure the Techniques document. (please review [2])  2.  Add as many techniques to the techniques document as possible.  3.  Close out as many open issues from the issues list as possible.  4.  Plan for the next phase  5. Review and approve a new charter.    We have a call scheduled for this Thursday at 4:00 Eastern on   +1-617-252-1038.  However, Thursday is a holiday in many countries, so   attendance may be low.  I encourage lots of discussion on the list over the   next few weeks.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/19991021.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991105/        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/05/10-minutes.html    10 May 2001 WCAG WG minutes  Summary of action items and resolutions  ?       Action KHS: help finish introduction - link to info about   assumptions and info from EO work and UAAG1.0. Plan to have something to   the group by next week.  ?       Resolved: process for sending open issues to techniques subgroups:   subgroup gets assigned open issue, up to them to resolve. best to do it in   context of techniques document. editor of the techniques doc takes the   action item.  ?       Action MM: resolve issue of absolute units for table layout within   the HTML techniques.  ?       Resolved (at least for today): criteria for determining equivalency   is based on purpose and task. caveat: translations - purpose may be to gain   full meaning of text. where that is the purpose, simplifying text is not   equivalent.  ?       Action MM: think about this resolution and respond.  ?       Action everyone: review PDF techniques.  ?       Resolved: PDF techniques on the agenda for next week. KHS says,   "ignore the numbers and think about which checkpoints they fit under." Some   feel like they can fit under more than one checkpoint.    Participants  ?       Jason White  ?       Gregory Rosmaita  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Katie Haritos-Shea  ?       Cynthia Shelly  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Paul Bohman  ?       Jeff Isom  ?       Marti McCuller  ?       Matt May    Introduction to WCAG 2.0  WL Looked good last time I read it.  JW Last year we noted that assumptions re: user agents, authors, users, and   assistive technologies should be documented.  KHS Know where to steal it from - stuff that Judy did. Also, nice piece in   UAAG1.0  WC Point to or summarize? Don't want to duplicate.  Action KHS: help finish introduction - link to info about assumptions and   info from EO work and UAAG1.0. Plan to have something to the group by next   week.    Bidirectional languages  WCAG 2.0 Issue #11  WC More than a bidirectional issue, I've heard it said about HTML tables   for layout in general.  JW Regardless, goes to HTML techniques group, does not go to the higher level.  WC Process then is that subgroup takes action, sends proposal to WG once   decided.  JW Yes, subgroup gets assigned open issue, up to them to resolve. best to   do it in context of techniques document.  Resolved: process for sending open issues to techniques subgroups: subgroup   gets assigned open issue, up to them to resolve. best to do it in context   of techniques document. editor of the techniques doc takes the action item.  Action MM: resolve issue of absolute units for table layout within the HTML   techniques.    Server-side issues  WL It could be a glossary rathole. Equivalents, even at fundamental level,   has spawned huge thread about alt-text and what does equivalent mean for that.  JW We need to make sure it doesn't go on forever.  WL Depends on what equivalent is equivalent to.  CS Something along the lines of: you should be able to accomplish the same   task in about the same amount of time. If the task is, "read content" then   using a different version you should be able to get the content. If   downloading a pen, or buying a pen...you should be able to do these things   in any of the versions.  PB I have developed a system where you take database content and put into   different templates. You're talking about the content itself, which is   different. e.g. you have a graphical version and one that replaces graphics   with text. The content doesn't change. YOu are talking about changing the   content.  CS Talking about both.  JW Continuim between changing structure, content, and just presentation. If   you remove all audio files and does not show that were there, then   disagreement.  CS Len mentioned idea of "essential purpose." Can you accomplish what the   site is intended to accomplish. A simplified version of text might do in   some cases, not in others.  WC Where is UAAG at on this?  GR Idea of "conditional content." Incorporates switch, alt, title,   longdesc. Wrestling with how do you alert user that there is conditional   content and does it need to be synchronized. Want to step through   conditional content. Can configure order to step through or to step through   at all. UAAG does not address "what can you do with what is served to you."  WC Assumes no processing on server-side and that all info passed to the client.  GR Since UAAG 1.0 does not deal with server-side. Encourage you to raise it   as an issue with UA WG. Probably end up on open issues for UAAG 2.0.  JW Some people who would say that they have the right to know that the   conditional content is there. others don't care.  CS Others confused or harmed by it in some way.  JW Certainly, a divide of opinion.  CS Fair amount of work in limiting choices to make interface easier to use.  JW We need to decide what are the criteria for determining if content is   equivalent. e.g. provide text equivalents in every version or providing   only in one.  CS There will be cases where that has to happen. e.g., the wap or any thin   client case where you optimize for a small device. you have to leave some   things out. There is an argument to be made for optimized versions. My   opinion - as long as you can switch and that the version w/alternatives is   equivalent (a diff. conversation).  PB Common that the main version should have WCAG 1.0 A conformance.  CS Assuming that there is a main version.  GR Just b/c serve something, assume 99% use all senses together, no reason   not to include accessibility features that are built into the language.   Can't assume that someone can access a proxy. If serving images have to   serve conditional context.  CS Unless the user says that they don't want alt-text.  GR Should be done through something like CC/PP.  CS Or some cookie-based mechanism or whatever. Could definitely be abused,   but don't make it against the rules if it can be done well.  WC We need to document those assumptions. Gets back to baseline discussion   that is not resolved.  JW To be resolved at the technology level.  CS Many of these things will be covered in the server-side techniques.  JW When do two versions count as equivalents? If there is a clear task to   be performed with the content, then one can use that as the criteria, ala   Cynthia's proposal. It can get complicated if you want you want to use it   for is different from what the creator intended. Or if there is not a clear   purpose. Then, perhaps a rewrite is necessary. Also raised in relation to   cognitive discussions a few weeks ago.  PB Where in the guidelines do we reference server-side?  CS There will be server-side techniques. I believe there should be some   normative aspects in this document.  PB There are things that shouldn't apply to every page.  JW Statement of conformance requirements.  WC Also hooks to server-side techniques from various checkpoints. What   about making some of the checkpoint solutions normative, as cynthia suggested?  JW We'll figure that out when we get there.  CS It does sound like a conformance issue. Only when testing things does it   become a concern. Not a guideline.  WC Could someone take an action to document so that we can refer to this   discussion later when we get to the point when we are focusing on conformance.  WL How do we currently define content?  CS Include tags or not.  JW Refer to meaning rather than structure or presentation.  KHS No definition in WCAG 2.0, UAAG "3 ways. ..." @@link.  JW Clear for UAAG purposes. Even tho used for multiple purposes can make   contextual distinctions.  WL How far back to we reach to find what the content is that we'll have   guidelines for. Do we reach to the server? Do we go into the mind of the   author?  MM Already separate content from presentaiton. Do we tell people to present   same content regardless of presentation. I have issue with using different   verbiage for different audiences. As long as you say, "if you can present   the same words and ideas on 2 different types of presentations, then we can   consider that accessible."  CS Can present same idea with different words.  MM Yes, but 2 audiences who are drawing different conclusions. When you   separate the idea from the words and communicate in different ways, people   will absorb in different ways.  CS I agree but if one group draws zero inferences, then how do you handle it?  WL No translation versus bad translation problem.  CS Adjusting things to reading levels. Common in educational material.   e.g., 6th grade math leaves a lot out. Have to do that to move on.  MM Also say write clearly and simply for your audience. Go too far if you   have a technique that says, "if you take this and boil it down to a certain   level - change wording, structure, etc. you make it inaccessible." You will   leave things out.  CS I don't want to see 2 things happen: 1 all content written to reading   level X, 2 prevent people from providing content at a lower reading level.  MM The issue is, if you say that a company can rewrite something in a lower   level. When someone reads the reduced content and is only able to use that   content, then reduced for all content.  WC How do you see that happening?  MM If someone has a laundry list, will apply it all to an "accessible version."  WC I hear you saying that we have to be very careful about how we define   the laundry list, but I do not think that we should avoid helping people   make easy to read versions of content in fear that that will be only   accessible version of content.  JW In guidelines we don't actually deal with translation, closest to   cognitive case. Translation is not always equivalent to the original.   Whatever we decide to do, we should not try to stretch the term equivalent   to cover both of them.  CS The statement that you made about expressing different things to   different audiences can apply to images and alt-text.  GR Functional equivalents and contextual equivalents.  JW An alt attribute is equivalent to image for purpose of understanding   content, they are not equivalent. Could get info from one that can't get   from the other. For the purpose of understanding, they are equivalent.  GR Functional equivalent of image is alt, contextual is longdesc. Image   serves a function in context of the page. The description of the image is a   contextual thing.  JW If I thought I could convey function of image in alt-text, not describe it.  GR If I have a the W3C "valid HTML" image, alt-text would be "valid HTML."   the function is, this content has been checked. in longdesc dcribe image.  JW Always differentiated between function and description.  JW Back to issue, cognitive equivalents seems to be stickiest aspect. My   feeling is to treat more as translation rather than equivalent.  GR It is an alternative not equivalent.  WL Not congruent.  JW If use Cynthia's definition, in some cases count as equivalents   sometimes not.  GR Function of image is to show has been validated. That it is a hyperlink,   belongs to link not image.  WL Important to have "reasonable" and "where appropriate" is important.  JW We seem to agree that functional equivalence is the ultimate criteria.   Separately, have translations or rewrites for cognitive purposes where the   same function might not be fulfilled but it may partially overlap.  CS There are cases where the goal is to "buy a pencil" rather than "convey   info" that you can simplify user interface and language so that person with   CD/LD can use it.  MM That falls under write simpley and clearly.  CS May not sell as many pencils without the pretty words.  Resolved (at least for today): criteria for determining equivalency is   based on purpose and task. caveat: translations - purpose may be to gain   full meaning of text. where that is the purpose, simplifying text is not   equivalent.  Action MM: think about this resolution and respond.  JW suspect that with right qualifications we can make this definition work.  PB Server-side ideas and conformance: if we are going to have a caveat that   if served out on some page some where in an accessible form, then can call   the site rather than the page accessible.  CS Don't think we've quite reached agreement. I will draft server-side   techniques in next couple weeks, that will help. Does that work for everyone?  JW Yes, gets down to conformance and priority issues. We decided not to   discuss until had substantially complete draft of the 3 levels of the document.  KHS Please look at the PDF techniques. Not sure which techniques fit under   which checkpoints.  Action everyone: review PDF techniques.  Resolved: PDF techniques on the agenda for next week. KHS says, "ignore the   numbers and think about which checkpoints they fit under." Some feel like   they can fit under more than one checkpoint.    $Date: 2001/05/10 21:36:56 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

      Michael,  In your comments, you said, "Technique 7.1.A - User notification of   potential screen flicker. Clarify that it's triggered on programmatic objects."    Does the following clarify this?    <proposed rewording>  Technique 7.1.A [priority 1] Verify that the page does not cause flicker.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Triggered by:  SCRIPT  OBJECT elements of type = (@@what are the type attribute values for Java,   etc.?)  EMBED  APPLET  IMG elements of the type 'animated gif'.  Example Language:  Display flicker is distracting and may be dangerous to some users. Please   ensure this element does not cause the display to flicker.

        Hello,    A few of us are going to have an initial discussion about applying a   combination of atag and wcag to web applications.  The call is scheduled   for 11 a.m. pacific/2 p.m. eastern and I will send call-in information to   people who respond to this message.  Please respond off-list.    The purpose of the call is two-fold:  1. bring together people from PFWG, AUWG, and WCAG WG for an initial   discussion of techniques for web applications.  2. brainstorm and collect issues with web applications.  for example, refer   to Mark Pilgrim's review of   gmail.  <http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/04/10/gmail-accessibility>    The reason for the ad hoc call and lack of scheduling is that I'm   presenting at WWW2004 next week and want to get some feedback before my   presentation.    Best,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

        Hello,    With the upcoming holidays, these proposals will remain open until 9   January.  After that time if no comments have been received about a   proposal or the comments are editorial tweaks that don't cause controversy   the proposal will be incorporated into the next possible internal working   draft.  Proposals that can not be resolved via discussion on the mailing   list will be discussed at a future WCAG WG teleconference.      Comment #1  WWAAC (via David Poulson and Colette Nicolle) , 4 Nov 2002 [1]  Benefits: 'Distractibility problems' could be reworded to say 'individuals   who are easily distracted'.    Proposal #1  Accept the proposed rewording so that the 2nd benefit reads, "Individuals   who are easily distracted may not be able to focus on page content with   flicker occurring in the same visual field."    ============  Comment #2  Terry Thompson, 21 Oct 2002 [2]  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [4]  Why is the high end of the dangerous flicker rate 49Hz?  508 recommends   55Hz. We should be consistent with that.    Proposal #2  - In the success criteria, use the interval: "between 2 Hz to 55 Hz."  - Reword Benefit #1 to read: "Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy can   have seizures triggered by flickering or flashing of 3 flashes per second   (Hertz) or faster with a peak sensitivity at 20 flashes per second.  An   upper limit of 55 Hz is used to be consistent with other guidelines."    Rationale:  Harding said (in a private email), "Current guidelines ban   flicker above 3/sec with no upper limit, 15% are  still sensitive at 60   Hz."  British broadcasters have not set an upper limit (with a couple   exceptions) as outlined in the "Photo-Sensitive Epilepsy (PSE) Guidelines."   http://www.films.demon.co.uk/online/pse.html    WCAG 1.0 uses the interval:  4 to 59 flashes per second.  While the low end   is not low enough, the high end (59Hz) is closer to Harding's recommendation.    However, 508 originally contained no upper limit but this was opposed and   changed to 55 Hz in the final rule.  Thus, to be consistent with 508, the   proposal is to use 55 Hz as the upper limit.   http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm    ==============  Comment #3  Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 [3]  On #3 in Level 2: if it is kept as a criteria consider changing it to a   Level 3 criteria. (note that in the 28 august draft, this became #4)  commenting on the statement, "(tougher test - that would make pages pass   with even slower equip. Equip might be old or just slow for other reasons)"    Proposal #3  Either delete this or change it to read, "Reviewer's note: we might propose   a tougher test that would make pages pass with even slower   equipment.  Equipment might be old or just slow for other reasons."    Rationale:  It appears to be an unfinished thought or a note.  If someone   can clean this up better than I can, please do.    ============  Comment #4  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [4]  Minimum success criteria: Since all success criteria must be testable, and   item 1b implies that 1a cannot be tested, item 1a should not be included as   a success criteria.    Proposal #4  rewrite the minimum to read:  1. At least one of the following is true:      a. content does not flicker or flash.      b. flickering or flashing of content is not between 3 Hz and 55 Hz.      c. if flicker is unavoidable, the user is warned of the flicker before   they go to the content, and as close a version of the content as is   possible without flicker is provided.  Reviewer's Note: A tool currently exists to test television broadcasts but   does not yet test Web content.  We're looking into how such a test and/or   tool might be designed.    Rationale:  1b was a reviewer's note about a tool.  Since it seems the only   way to test for flicker is with a tool, it made sense to apply it to all   three criteria.  1a was added for completeness.    ============  Comment #5  IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 [4]  Level 2 success criteria: Items # 1 and # 2 should be moved to Level 3. (in   the 28 august draft these are now #3 and #2)  Level Items #2 and #3 currently read:  2. content that might create a problem has been tested [using XYZ tool];   only pages with unavoidable flicker remain and appropriate warnings along   with a close alternative presentation have been provided for these pages.  3. a conformance claim associated with the content asserts conformance to   this checkpoint at level 2    Proposal #5  delete #2    Rationale: #2 is the same as the minimum level:  if pages contain flicker   then you have to the warn the user.  #3 will be reworded in the new draft per the resolution to reword or remove   these types of claims ala the resolution outlined at:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0044.html    ============  Comment #6  Phill Jenkins [5]  move success criteria for 2.3 from the minimum and level 2, to level 3   only, such that it includes the existing criteria of not "visibly or   purposely flicker between 3 and 49  Mhz", etc.    Proposal #6  This issue requires follow-up with Phill since he is saying that Checkpoint   2.3 should not have any minimum level or level 2 success criteria - only   level 3.  Check back with him after we discuss the rest of the proposals in   this message.    ===========  Comment #7  Phill Jenkins [5]  Web examples of "bad flicker" be identified and evaluated such that common   testable characteristics be identified.  In other words, further the   science here for the benefit of the browsers and authors and especially   evaluation tools testing for compliance.  The work referenced by Wendy of   Professor G. Harding and the HardingFPA system from Cambridge Research   Systems is mostly, if not all about traditional TV broadcast images and   needs to be applied to the Web browsers and content.    Proposal #7  Yes. This should be done.  Gregg and I have been in contact with Cambridge   Research Systems and hopefully someone a tool will emerge that analyzes Web   content for flicker.    ===========  Comment #8  After comments 6 and 7 are closed, re-open a work item for the ER   interest/working  group.    Proposal #8  It is a requirement of WCAG 2.0 that success criteria be testable, thus   this is a work item for the WCAG WG not the ERT WG.  Thus, whatever the   results of 6 and 7, the work be done by WCAG WG and incorporated into a   draft of WCAG 2.0.      ===========  Comment #9  SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002 [6]  "content was not designed to flicker (or flash) in the range of 3 to 49   Hz." Could you include a visual example?    Proposal #9  We will have to provide strong disclaimers. I would prefer to provide   examples of content that meets the requirements (e.g., good   examples).  However, people want to know what it looks like and want to   test their tools. Here is an example from a webaim tutorial.  Please be   careful looking at this image!!!   http://www.webaim.org/contentobjects/tutorials/seizuregraphic    Thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0135.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0080.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0111.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0117.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Dec/0000.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0130.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--        

      William,    At the 23 August 2001 telecon [1] we discussed issue #4 [2] which you   raised a while ago.  The issue is as follows:  4. Semantics in style  Issue  8 August 2000 - William Loughborough. If I use style to convey semantics,   how do I pass along the semantics to someone who does not use style sheets?   The class name is not something that gets shown to the user. There must be   some way to convey intended semantics presented via presentation mode.    The working group thinks this is closed as it is covered by checkpoint 1.3   (use structure), 1.5 (separate content and structure) and CSS   techniques.  Do you agree that this issue is closed?  Could you help   reframe the question so that we can attempt to address it?    Thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2001/08/23-minutes.html#4  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html#4  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Graham,    I think if you mean "text" then we ought to say "text" or "text content" instead of "passive content."  As you said in your follow-up post, we already use "active elements" and "text."  Both of these are "content" in the UAAG 1.0 definition [1]:  In this specification, the noun "content" is used in three ways:    It is used to mean the document object as a whole or in parts.   It is used to mean the content of an HTML or XML element, in the sense employed by the XML 1.0 specification ([XML], section 3.1): "The text between the start-tag and end-tag is called the element's content." Context should indicate that the term content is being used in this sense.   It is used in the context of the phrases non-text content and text content.   [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/glossary.html#def-content    The UAAG definition of "Text content, non-text content, text element, non-text element, text equivalent non-text equivalent" is at:   http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/glossary.html#def-non-text-content    a definition of rendered content is available at:   http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/glossary.html#def-rendered-content    In general, I think we can use these definitions.  I mistakenly said these were from the ATAG document in my previous email. These are from UAAG.    --wendy        At 04:28 PM 1/27/02, goliver@accease.com wrote:  >Katie  >Here is a post   >http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0900.html   >where I suggested a distinction which I felt would be  >useful in terms of defining content.  >  >Of all the definitions of content provided in your  >original post, the following is the one that I  >understand the most.   >  >Telecom Glossary  >http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/t1glossary2000/_content.html  >content: In Web terminology, the text, media, and links  >or information displayed by a browser at a particular  >Web site.

      Hello,    Charles commented to the wai-gl list, and Lisa Seeman agreed that the R1   statement ought to make it clear that while we try to make our deliverables   understandable and usable by policy makers, we will not let them drive our   decisions about technical requirements.    Judy, Gregg, Jason, Charles and I have discussed the following   proposal.  We would like to give you all until this Friday (19 April) to   review.  If there are no objections, this will be incorporated into a new   draft of the Requirements and we will aim to publish to TR early next week.   We will also allow time for discussion at this week's telecon.    We are proposing a new R2 to supplement the existing R1 proposal.    R1: WCAG 2.0 deliverables should be more understandable and usable by a   wider audience than was anticipated for WCAG 1.0, including policy   makers.   While the WCAG WG does not set policy, harmonization of   accessibility requirements helps drive demand for supporting   implementations in Web applications; therefore it should be easy for policy   makers and individuals responsible for implementing policy  to understand,   cite and/or adopt WCAG 2.0 and related deliverables.    R2:   We will try to express the technical requirements in language that   policy makers can understand, adopt, and use, but technical requirements   are not driven by policy; they are driven by the needs of users with   disabilities.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      I have realized that the "additional actions" section for each Technique is   actually the suggested repair.  I propose that we rename this section,   "Suggested repair."    Also, we decided each Evaluation section should have an "Element" and   "Requirement."  Sometimes the "Element" is really more of a   "Condition."  It might make more sense to use "Condition."  I don't propose   a change at this point, but it is something to keep in mind as you reread   the document.    --wendy    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    The ER group is working on Techniques for Accessibility Evaluation and   Repair Tools (AERT) document. What do you think of the following   suggestions for where to place labels in relationship to form controls to   satisfy Checkpoint 10.2 (Until user agents support explicit associations   between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly   associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.)    1. Labels for radio buttons and checkboxes should appear after the radio   button or checkbox. For example: [checkbox] oranges, [checkbox] apples.  2. Labels for text fields appear before the text field. For example: last   name [text area].  3. Labels for groups of any form control should appear before the group.   For example: choose a city [radio button] Boston [radio button] Madison.    If this is agreeable then I will add this to the section on Forms in the   HTML Techniques for WCAG document.

      The latest version of the requirements document is available at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-req-20000419.html    This version looks much different from other versions as Ian was able to   boil the requirements down to 5 major sections. I believe the structure   that Ian created is much easier to read and understand.    Please think about the following questions as you review:  1. Are all of the ideas from the face2face covered in these documents? If   not, should they be or is it better to leave some issues out of the   requirements document?

      here is a good explanation of table linearization and the use of structural   elements (taken from Techniques for WCAG [1]):    <blockquote>  However, when it is necessary to use a table for layout, the table must   linearize in a readable order. When a table is linearized, the contents of   the cells become a series of paragraphs (e.g., down the page) one after   another. Cells should make sense when read in order (row-wise or   column-wise) and should include structural elements (that create   paragraphs, headers, lists, etc.) so the page makes sense after linearization.  </blockquote>    --w    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tables  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      There has been a request for clarification from the Evaluation and Repair   tools working group regarding table linearization.  The group referred to   the definition in the glossary of WCAG 1.0, while I thought the   interpretation in the Techniques for WCAG 1.0 was preferred.  Regardless,   the two definitions are out of synch and we need to fix that.    thoughts?    compare the techniques document   http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tables-layout (section 4.5.2)  <blockquote>  Authors should use style sheets for layout and positioning. However, when   it is necessary to use a table for layout, the table must linearize in a   readable order. When a table is linearized, the contents of the cells   become a series of paragraphs (e.g., down the page) one after another.

      Charles,    Are you suggesting something along the lines of <P   class="http://foo.bar/definition.htm"> ?    That does not seem to be the most elegant way to do things.  Isn't there   some way to use RDF?  Namespaces?  something else?  I agree that the URI is   helpful for the person who want to find out about the semantics, but how   would this be machine-understandable?    I like Marja's original idea of include ID's on elements.  ID's could be   arbitrary and automatically generated for block elements.

      Hello,    I think Kynn's and Marshall's points are very well made that we need clear   technology-specific checkpoints (or whatever we call them). I also think   that Charles'and Ian's points are well made that we do not want to break   old terminology.    Therefore, I'm trying to imagine how the technology-specific checkpoints   will fit in to the scheme of things.  I have drafted some HTML-specific   checkpoints just to see how it works.  Note that these are really, really   rough.  This was a quick pass.    I know this is going in the opposite direction of where William is pushing   (to list only the principles and work from there) <grin>, but I am much   more involved in Techniques and technology-specifics these days.  Thus, I   need to appease that this level will work in some way before only focusing   on principles, if in fact that is the best approach to take.    <imagining>  In the Guidelines document:    Guideline 1: Ensure that all content can be presented in any medium or   combination of media that may be required by the user.    Checkpoints:  1.1 Provide a textual equivalent for every non-text (auditory or graphical)   component or multimedia presentation.    In the HTML techniques document:    Checkpoint 1.1 Provide a textual equivalent for every non-text (auditory or   graphical) component or multimedia presentation.  In HTML this means:  <HTML checklist>  1. Provide a short text equivalent via the "alt" attribute for every IMG   element or in the content of every OBJECT element used to embed an image.  2. Provide a description of important visual features via the "longdesc"   attribute for every complex IMG element or in the content of every OBJECT   element used to embed a complex image. [ugh, used complex]  3. Provide a text equivalent for every programmatic object embedded with   OBJECT, APPLET, or EMBED.  Note that APPLET and EMBED are   deprecated.  Refer to the sections on auditory descriptions, captions, and   making applets directly accessible.  4. Provide a text equivalent in the NOSCRIPT element for every scripting   object that is necessary to accessing the page.  For example, if a rollover   only causes the appearance of a button to change, a text equivalent is not   necessary.  However, if a rollover causes further information about a   button to display, a text equivalent is necessary.  5. Provide a link to a transcript for every audio file in the content of   the OBJECT element if OBJECT is used to embed the audio file, in a P   element if P is used to embed the audio file, in ...?? Refer to sections on   how and when to caption audio files.  6. etc etc etc  </HTML checklist>    Examples and Discussion for Checkpoint 1.1 HTML 1  ...    Examples and Discussion for Checkpoint 1.1 HTML 2  ...    </imagining>    It would be easier to refer to the technology specifics if we had something   specific to call them.  "Technology-specific checkpoints" seems long and it   is a new term.  However, I would prefer to add a new term to what will   actually be new than renaming something that exists already.    In other words, I tend to agree that the proposed Principles are similar to   the current WCAG 1.0 Guidelines.  Proposed Guidelines and WCAG 1.0   checkpoints also seem to have a similar feel.  I believe that what is new   is the idea of technology-specific checks.  I don't care so much what we   call them, but I agree that we do not want to break the old terminology.    Therefore, perhaps we could focus naming the newest layer.  I propose  a. "Technology specific checkpoints" or  b.  "HTML-specific checkpoints" then "CSS-specific checkpoints" etc. or  c. "HTML checks" "CSS checks" etc. or  d. "HTML tests" "CSS tests" etc.    thoughts?  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Present: Jo, Matt, Andi, Wendy, Kynn, Al (by IRC - as "classy"), Joel    Agenda: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001OctDec/0286.html    Summary:  - Dividing 15 sections of css techs into 3 groups.  Joel take responsibility for 1st five, Jo for 2nd set, Matt 3rd set.  They'll be coordinating on coding and testing techniques.  - Andi and Kynn will begin collecting issues from the mailing lists since nov 2000 (when last version published as note).  Andi will go through wai-gl archives, Kynn will go through wai-ig archives.  - Al is interested in nitpicking 'class' choices if you will tolerate this  - Try to chat on 12 November before the F2F meeting and see where we're at.  Or at least coordinate on e-mail.      Detailed minutes:  Jo testing on Mac. already working on test pages - units of measurement.  ASW can help w/testing  <Jo> test page is at http://jomiller.com/css/fontsizetest.html  <Jo> more to come.  <classy> Hi, 'classy' is Al Gilman in Haloween disguise  <wendy> what should be the priority for a draft for the F2F meeting?  <classy> Anything that helps answer a bonafide question that came in on WAI-IG  JS If every technique was coded with screen shots. in the 3 yrs played with.  table that listed User Agents.  JM Would like to collaborate on that.  resiability of fonts  have mac and windows, no linux.  JS I have linux w/mozilla and opera  WC webreview chart is great, but don't show interaction w/assistive technologies  jm and somewhat inaccurate.  <classy> Is there capability in either Adobe or Corel to take a bitmapped screen shot and object-recognize it into SVG?  Then we could make the screen shots faithful but WAVE like annotated, too.  js i can start w/font section and work way through list. cover opera and mozilla and netscape 6  jm i'll cover whichever you don't cover  wc reads classy's question  js interesting question.  good idea.  wc who wants to follow up? .. al?   <classy> Let's see if Chaals knows anything.  He's double dipper on this one, AU and SVG Techs.  asw - anyone testing w/ie5?   jm i can do that 5 and 5.5 for mac, 5 for windows  asw is all the testing covered? i can do home page reader  jm aol?   wc need matrix of browsers/platforms/assistive technologies.  asw can help edit and maintain list of issues  asw how run? weekly call?  <classy> Accessibility Forum is doing a survey [matrix cells] could collaborate there.  I could follow up on this one.  wc some calls, need to figure out how to wok w/each other.  mm interop w/html techs and coding techniques  <classy> Does our vision for the CSS Techs doc. include comprehensive exaples at the page and House Style level as well as point by point exampleLets?  jm sounds like gathering examples, screen shots good way to go. even if get started on before meeting. then say yes or no.  js divide up the subsections and contribute. 15 sections i can take the 1st five  asw any browser support aural?  wc think emacspeak w/WWW browser is the only one.  js sooner or later, baseline capabilities will come up. using positioning, etc.  what will older browsers we will shut out.  <Kynn> hey you skipped me ;)  kb editing, piecing together, open issues and bugs  <classy> ag nitpicking 'class' choices if you will tolerate this  js jm, you don' thave os 10?  <Kynn> You expect me to tolerate anything you do, Al? :)  * wendy reads ag's note  <Kynn> I can work on reviewing feedback  js i will take first 5, to code those techniques. render in browsers and test. provide screen shots.  <classy> ciao, Wendy - let me know if GL wants me to follow up on AF/Interop contact or if GV wants to do it.  Resolved: js take 1st five, jm 2nd five, mm last five.  This means, they take responsibility, everyone helps.  Need to coordinate amongst each other.  asw in gathering issues - go back to november 2000? one take ig other take gl  kb at least, assemble the list of comments  asw - i'll do gl  kb i'll take ig  wc for now, send stuff to me and I'll post.  We'll figure out editing privileges and access to W3C server later.  wc next time to chat? monday - 12 november  we'll figure out on e-mail.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Anne,    I have included the AU WG on my response to address the 2nd issue you raise.    My understanding of your message is:  1. in your experience, the children that you work with are less likely to   follow "in your face" URLs so therefore you support adding something to the   techniques document.    2. One way that you are able to create text links is using IE and FrontPage   reader and you've outlined those steps as a proposal to add to our   techniques document.    3. Another observation you have made is that children and perhaps also   people with CD and LD find shorter links easier to navigate.    I'll respond to each of these:  1. I'm glad we have some informal data to back up and provide more   rationale for avoiding "in your face" URLs.    2. Currently, we do not have any techniques that are specific to one   authoring tool.  People have requested this information but we have not   provided any yet.  Since these are both Microsoft products, I think it   would be more appropriate for them to produce something that we could point   to.  Ideally a document that shows how to work with their tools to follow   all of the WCAG checkpoints - ala Guideline 6 in the Authoring Tool   Accessibility Guidelines [1].  What do others think about this?  Does   Microsoft have documentation online that we can refer to from the   techniques to help people make the connection between WCAG and the tool   they are using?  What about other authoring tools?    3.  People in general seem to find shorter links easier to use - assuming a   link has been given enough context so that it's destination is clear.  User   Interface Engineering discusses link length in their book "Web Site   Usability: A Designer's Guide" which is based on a series of usability   studies.  Jakob Nielsen also discusses link length in his book "Designing   Web Usability."  Links that are too short can be ambiguous and confusing.

        Hello,    Reminders and thoughts about upcoming events:    1. We will have a F2F meeting the Sunday and Monday *after* CSUN (23 and 24   March).  I will be announcing registration and logistics information   ASAP.  The focus of this meeting is expected to be general WCAG 2.0 issues.    2. Reminder: registration closes 26 February for the F2F on 4 March [1] in   Cambridge, MA.   The focus of this meeting is Techniques.    3. There will be a WAI Glossary meeting Friday (7 March).  I will announce   registration and logistics information ASAP.  If you are interested in   attending in person (we will not have phone support for this meeting),   please send me a private email.    4. We would like to hold a meeting in Europe, most likely Venice, Italy   most likely sometime between May and July.  Please send me a private email   with dates that you prefer and dates that you are not available.    5. Are there other events that you are likely to attend this year that we   could piggyback with a WCAG WG F2F?  Ideas for European, Asian, South   American and African events  are particularly welcome so that we can better   ensure input from the wide world on our *World Wide* Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines. Please send me a private email with suggestions.    Best,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/03/04-f2f-agenda.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      Some time ago (26 August to be precise) I took an action item to write a   technique for using the MAP element to group navigation links.  Here is my   proposal based on the minutes from the 26 August joint meeting between UA   WG and WCAG WG   [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0307.html]    The main sticking point in the minutes was that the HTML recommendation did   not specify say that it was o.k. to use MAP to mark up block content not   associated with an image.  Since then, HTML 4.01 has been published and   says, "The MAP element specifies a client-side image map (or other   navigation mechanism) that may be associated with another elements (IMG,   OBJECT, or INPUT). An image map is associated with an element via the   element's usemap attribute. The MAP element may be used without an   associated image for general navigation mechanisms."  [http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#edef-MAP]    I propose that section 6.2 of the HTML Techniques module should read:  <blockquote>  6.2 Grouping and bypassing links  Checkpoints in this section:  13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until   user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group. [Priority 3]  10.5 Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render adjacent   links distinctly, include non-link, printable characters (surrounded by   spaces) between adjacent links. [Priority 3]    When links are grouped into logical sets (for example, in a navigation bar   that appears on every page in a site) they should be marked up as a unit.   Navigation bars are usually the first thing someone encounters on a page.   For users with speech synthesizers, this means hearing a number of links on   every page before reaching the interesting content. There are several ways   to allow users to bypass groups of links (as users with vision do when they   see the same set on each page):  - Include a link that allows users to skip over the set of navigation links.  - Use the HTML 4.0 "tabindex" attribute to allow users to jump to an anchor   after the set of navigation links. This attribute is not yet widely supported.  - Provide a style sheet that allows users to hide the set of navigation links.  - In the future, user agents will allow users to skip over elements such as   navigation bars.  - In HTML, use the MAP element to group links then identify the group with   the "title" attribute.  Example.  In this example, the MAP element groups a set of links, the "title"   attribute identifies it as a navigation bar, "tabindex" is set on an anchor   following the group, and a link at the beginning of the group links to the   anchor after the group. Also, note that the links are separated by   non-link, printable characters (surrounded by spaces).      <HEAD>      <TITLE>How to use our site</TITLE>      </HEAD>      <BODY>        <MAP title="navigation bar">          [<A href="#how">Bypass navigation bar</A>]          [<A href="home.html">Home</A>]          [<A href="search.html">Search</A>]          [<A href="new.html">New and highlighted</A>]          [<A href="sitemap.html">Site map</A>]        </MAP>        <H1><A name="how" tabindex="1">How to use our site</A></H1>      <!-- content of page -->      </BODY>  This use of the MAP element is discussed in the HTML 4.01 Recommendation   [reference].  </blockquote>      For comparison, the current HTML Techniques module   [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000309/html-techniques.html]   contains the following text:  <blockquote>  6.2 Grouping and bypassing links  Checkpoints in this section:  13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until   user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group. [Priority 3]  10.5 Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render adjacent   links distinctly, include non-link, printable characters (surrounded by   spaces) between adjacent links. [Priority 3]  @@this section needs to be updated with the MAP technique discussed a while   back  When links are grouped into logical sets (for example, in a navigation bar   that appears on every page in a site) they should be marked up as a unit.   Navigation bars are usually the first thing someone encounters on a page.   For users with speech synthesizers, this means having to hear a number of   links on every page before reaching the interesting content of a page.   There are several ways to allow users to bypass groups of links (as users   with vision do when they see the same set on each page):  Include a link that allows users to skip over the set of navigation links.  Use the HTML 4.0 "tabindex" attribute to allow users to jump to an anchor   after the set of navigation links. This attribute is not yet widely supported.  Provide a style sheet that allows users to hide the set of navigation links.  In the future, user agents will allow users to skip over elements such as   navigation bars.  In HTML, use the DIV, SPAN, P, or FRAME elements to group links then   identify the group with the "id" or "class" attributes.  Example.  In this example, the P element groups a set of links, the "class" attribute   identifies it as a navigation bar (e.g., for style sheets), "tabindex" is   set on an anchor following the group, and a link at the beginning of the   group links to the anchor after the group. Also, note that the links are   separated by non-link, printable characters (surrounded by spaces).      <HEAD>      <TITLE>How to use our site</TITLE>      </HEAD>      <BODY>        <P class="nav">          [<A href="#how">Bypass navigation bar</A>]          [<A href="home.html">Home</A>]          [<A href="search.html">Search</A>]          [<A href="new.html">New and highlighted</A>]          [<A href="sitemap.html">Site map</A>]        </P>        <H1><A name="how" tabindex="1">How to use our site</A></H1>      <!-- content of page -->      </BODY>  </blockquote>    thoughts?  --wendy    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      This is a good question.  I think this is how I see it:  1. the CHECKPOINTS describe how to make content accessible for people with disabilities  2. the PRIORITIES help the content provider determine where to start.    Every checkpoint should help make content more accessible.  Ideally a content provider would conform to all of them.  However, a list of ten is easier for the content provider to swallow than a list of 21.  We don't want to overwhelm them or they won't do anything.    The OTACS-2 minimal set puts priority on those things that only the content provider can provide.

      Please review the notes for a presentation given at SUNY/CUAD 2000 by Kynn   Bartlett at: http://www.idyllmtn.com/papers/suny2000/notes.html    Each discussion is broken into the following 4 sections:    What It Means: A plain description of the checkpoint, and why it matters.    The Tricky Part: "Gotchas" or things that aren't obvious.  If WCAG were   easy to understand, you wouldn't need me to help you!    How To Check: Practical information on how you can tell if your page passes   muster.  In most of these, I refer to specific techniques or software in   boldface; these are listed in the appendix at the back with download and   reference links.    Sample Code: Examples of HTML highlighting the specific accommodations   necessary to maintain accessibility.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        Hello,    I spoke with Ian yesterday about UAAG Conformance.  A user agent makes a conformance claim based on a "profile" as described at [1].  We discussed the possibility that UAAG profiles could be used in checkpoint 5.2 to describe the baseline and in 5.4 to describe what is required of a web application/embedded interface.      Thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20020728/conformance.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Eric,    The ERT WG is talking about storing EARL data.  When you and I talked in Nice, I vaguely remember you saying that the annotations store was generic enough to accommodate whatever RDF data got sent to it?  If so, could we save EARL to the annotations store w/out an annotations "wrapper?"      Regardless, we feel it would be cleaner to have our own EARL store.    We've been looking at the w3c documentation at:   http://www.w3.org/1999/02/26-modules/User/RdfSQL-HOWTO.html    Looks like all we'd have to do on the W3C server is create our own EARL RDF table?  Do we need to get permission from W3C management or systeam to do this?    Thanks,  --w      --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      I switched the order of 5.1.A and 5.1.B as per Michael's comment that we   first need to determine the purpose of the table before we can check row   and column headers. They now read:    Technique 5.1.A Determine the purpose of the table  Technique 5.1.B [priority 1] Check the table for row and column headers    --w  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        I tried to incorporate your comments, Len, in the following proposal.   Hopefully it conveys that if none of the presentation elements or   attributes exist then we just need to verify that structural elements are   not being abused.  Perhaps this ought to link to those techniques.  For   now, I suggest "verify that the author has chosen not to modify   presentation in any way."  that's pretty open-ended, perhaps too much so?    <blockquote>  Technique 3.3.1 [priority 2] Check document for use of style sheets.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Check the document for presence of STYLE or LINK rel="stylesheet" elements   within the HEAD element or use of "style" attributes throughout the document.  Check for FONT and BASEFONT elements, and the "text," "vlink," "link," and   "alink" attributes on BODY.    Example of a message to be displayed:  Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. For example, use the   CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT and BASEFONT elements to   control font styles    Repair Technique:  If none of these elements are identified, verify that the author has chosen   not to modify the presentation in any way.    If FONT or BASEFONT elements or "text," "vlink," "link," and "alink"   attributes on BODY, suggest or help the author convert the presentatin   properties to style sheets.    If the author chosses to convert deprecated markup to style sheets or add   style sheets, trigger technique 6.1 to verify that the document is readable   when style sheets are not applied.  </blockquote>  At 09:37 PM 1/30/00 , Leonard R.

        Hello,    I have added more detail to the agenda for next week.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-agenda.html#Agenda    Several of the items are links to issues in the ETA system.  Most of these   are work items and should not require too much discussion.  I hope we can   get through as many of them as possible next week.    Jonathan Chetwynd, Jim Ley, and I met 25 June to discuss client-side   scripting.  I have added a few issues to ETA from that discussion. I took   an action to revise Jonathan's current draft.  Jim has sent me comments to   incorporate. I hope to have a draft before the meeting next week.    Please also refer to the list of "Required Reading" included on the meeting   page.  I don't expect you to read everything. Please focus on the documents   that interest you.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-agenda.html#Readings    Please come to the meeting prepared to have fun and do lots of work! :)    Best,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Hello all,    Here are the details.  Sorry I didn't get them out sooner.    The phone call will begin at 5:00 p.m. Eastern US (22:00 UCT) Monday 12 November (9 a.m. Tuesday 13 November) here in Melbourne.  Those on the phone will attend for 4 hours then drop off.      To find out what time it is in your Time Zone, here is a time zone convertor. http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc  Be sure to use the Melbourne time since that is the one I am surest about. <grin/>    We will use the new W3C bridge named Zakim.  You dial the number, then will be asked to enter a passcode.  +1-617-761-6200 passcode 7000    We will hopefully have an IRC channel open and take minutes there.    server: irc.w3.org  port: 6665  channel: #wai-wcag    This will be especially crucial for you attending by phone. You can "raise your hand" or let us know if you can't hear us well enough.  For more info on IRC, refer to http://www.irchelp.org    I have the following people registered to attend by phone:  William Loughborough  Andi Snow-Weaver  Loretta Guarino Reid  Gregg Vanderheiden  Katie Haritos-Shea  Tim Lacy  Annuska Perkins    For an hour on Monday evening (U.S. and Europe/Tuesday a.m. in Oz), we will hopefully be joined by the IMS folks to discuss what each of our groups are doing.  More on that when the time comes.  http://www.imsproject.org/    Be well.  Let's have a great meeting.  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Geoff asked "can you please send me a list of the sections that require work so I can choose which ones I may be best fit for?"  Others might be asking themselves the same question.  Here is my quick response of what needs work.  I haven't sent this by Gregg and Jason first, so they might have a slightly different opinion, but here is my point of view.    1.   In your response you mention clarifying A, AA, and AAA. However, the group has not decided that we will use the same conformance scheme in WCAG 2.0 that we developed in WCAG 1.0. Therefore, I'm not sure what there is to write, unless you are interested in working on a FAQ for WCAG 1.0.    If you are interested in recent discussions about conformance refer to the mail archives and minutes from previous meetings.  A summary of previous discussions and  a proposal for how to move forward would be helpful. Although, we've put off this discussion until the success criteria are more solid.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/minutes-history.html    2.  How about creating examples?  We need examples and clarifying text for every technology that we are creating techniques documents for.  You could look at these documents and find where you might be of help.  I think the only document that is well covered is CSS Techniques.   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/#20-techs  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/#techniques-tests    3.  We have the following issues list for WCAG 2.0. Do you see anything in here that you could help clarify?  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html    4.  Or what about some of the issues contained within the latest draft that need clarifying? (do a text search on "issue." e.g. "Issue: it has been proposed that we provide multiple, automatically generated "views" of the guidelines document for different purposes, using XSLT. What are the different "views" of the document that we should make available? Should we also have versions that include techniques or technology-specific success criteria (i.e., the technology-specific layer), along with the guidelines, checkpoints and generic success criteria? "  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/    Does that help?  --wendy      At 05:05 PM 1/24/02, Geoff Deering wrote:  >If you ask which sections I would like to work on, can you please send me a  >list of the sections that require work so I can choose which ones I may be  >best fit for?  >  >If it is more open ended, I would like to write something concerned with  >this thread.

        Hello,    Our public working draft was published today. It is available at:   http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/    A formal announcement and calls for review will be sent to other working   groups in the near future.    As well as making the edits to the working draft, Ben updated the change   history with information since the last TR   draft:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/change-history.html  (Thanks Ben!)    --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      available at: http://jigteam.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/09/28-minutes.html    28 September 2000 WCAG WG telecon    Summary of agenda items for next week's F2F  Go through edits to recent draft to determine if we should  ?       keep as is  ?       modify and try again  Actual discussion of proposed changes will occur in following telecons and   discussions on the list. This is just to get a feel for consensus on edits   not to bring the group to consensus.    Break into groups to discuss technology-specific techniques. As part of   this discussion, consider how we will handle "until user agent" clauses.   Can we get rid of? Do we need to state assumptions? Is there some way to   say "this is ideally what we'd like but it's not supported yet so in the   meantime..."  Should we consider XML in this document or keep it separate?  ?       KB believes that creating a new language and writing content in a   language are two different activities for two different audiences, thus   keep them in separate documents.  ?       JW believes that these documents and practices are quickly converging.    Discuss user interface metaphors and how they are influenced by changes in   technology like Voice Browsing and XForms. How will we address these   metaphors in WCAG 2.0?    Open discussion about reactions to the Device Independent Authoring   Workshop to harvest interesting ideas, update those who did not attend, and   give those who did attend a chance to digest.    With regards to the afternoon with AU WG: ask them to review WCAG 2.0 for   dependencies with ATAG 1.0 and discuss how filling out a Web form can be   creating Web content.    Planning  ?       When should we aim to go to last call?  ?       When would people like to see a Recommendation?  ?       When and where is our next face to face meeting? Volunteers to host?  ?       When should we publish working drafts of the techniques that we've   discussed?  ?       Are people interested in inviting experts in various technologies   to present to the group to educate us and for Q&A about how our spec   relates to other technologies? e.g., invite a MathML guru to discuss MathML   so we can determine how well our draft will cover MathML as well as what   techniques we should develop for MathML.    Normative vs. Non-normative (?  issue #17 in the issues list). As part of   this discussion Kynn will hopefully demonstrate (or at least discuss) using   XML/XSLT to generate multiple versions of the document.  ?       If multiple versions exist, how does one claim conformance? How do   we write the conformance statement?  ?       How does one claim conformance on muliple views of documents? How   does an author who is generating multiple views determine if they conform?  ?        Gregory and William will present "cyber-ghetto" issues.    Summary of action items  ?       Action WC: Summarize agenda items.  ?       Action: WC/GV/JW: Propose times for handling proposed agenda items.  ?       Action WC: Add dynamically generated (from database) to open issues   list.  ?       Action WC: Add link to test pages from WCAG Home page underneath   the work on Techniques section.    Participants  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Loretta Guarino Reid  ?       Dick Brown  ?       Matt May  ?       Jason White  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Kynn Bartlett  ?

Get "ya's -   good edit" or "nay's - bad edit." Ya's we'll leave as is, the Nay's we'll   go through once we get back and work on to make better. I would like clear   idea if we have consensus on these changes, some were fairly substantial  CS and GR agree good idea.  JW CMN suggests a techniques session. Wishes ATAG would have done more work   on Techniques before going to Rec.  CS, LRG, WC like that idea.  JW Editing on the spot, proposing techniques in smaller groups. Whole group   considering.  WC Also help us to see who interested in which technologies.  GR Definitely helped with UAAG Guidelines last year.  WL Which languages?  WC Name any of 'em! Should first write about those that we get the most   questions about, but should help people using whatever language conform to   WCAG.  WL Want parallel documents to HTML and CSS?  WC Yes.  JW And checklists as discussed last week.  WL The number of items that will be covered by these technologies will be   small. Of the 65 checkpoints, SMIL is only associated with 2.  JW Yes, there will be a limited number.  WC What about XML? Kynn, still think it should be a separate document?  KB Different audience: using a technology versus creating a new language.  JW Think the distinction will become less.  Resolution: put it on the agenda  CS Stating our assumptions. What do we expect a browser to do? Make that   more concrete.  JW UAAG will be relevant. By the time WCAG 2.0 begins process to Rec we   should have UAAG in place. Will be dependency on them.  CS How to determine when UUA clause is met.  WC Or how to get rid of it.  CS Although spec will always be ahead of implementation.  LGR Seems at odds with the backwards compatibility item.  MM The existing UUA are preferable but not reliable, it is the direction   W3C wants the technology to head. Since Backwards compatibility is the goal   of several specs it seems to put it in "this is how things should have been."  JW We have by and large eliminated "until user agents." last week,   discussed the idea that requirements that are dependent on UA should be   treated in techniques with exceptions and qualifications.  WC Perhaps part of the break-out groups discuss until user agents in   regards to specific technologies in break out sessions on techniques.  JW user interface design and metaphors are being influenced by Voice   Browser working group and XForms.  CS With several of us going to the DIW there should be good new info.  WC Should we have a discussion about that for those who did not go (an   update) as well as letting those of us who did go share thoughts and ideas?  /* lots of agreement */  WC Anything in specific to discuss with AU WG?  JW What dependencies do we have that ought to be discussed?  WC Anything in particular we want them to think about or read? The new   draft? Specific checkpoints?  WL Forms. Cuts across UA, WCAG, and AU. The browser or server becomes an   authoring tool.  WC What exactly do we need to ask?  WL We have to make our forms requirement so that it acknowledges what the   ATAG requires.  WC So we can ask AU WG for help how to address that.  WL When you fill out a form on a Web page you are a Web author.  MM You're average content management system is essentially that.  WC HTML WG asking for requirements, spend some time thinking about at the   F2F or on the list?  JW We're getting a lot of agenda items, prioritize?  WL HTML, Techniques, when a technique is applicable to a variety of   technologies and priorities appears in one place with no caveat.  JW We haven't dealt with priorities yet.  WC Planning - set milestones, aim for when go to last call, next f2f, etc.  WC Normative vs non-normative  GR Home page: no link to test pages.  Action WC: Add link to test pages from WCAG Home page underneath the work   on Techniques section.  /* WC goes through proposed agenda items */  GV We have not dealt with the document-based vs. server-based flexibility.   How do our guidelines work if the server actually serves different pages to   different people. "All content should be servable that meets the following   specs."  JW Basically what guideline 2 says. If there are issues with that, then we   should put them into the discussion.  GV One form kicks it out as vanilla HTML (no tables, charts, etc.) like an   alt-text page. In old one, alt-text page is last resort. Perhaps it should   be a first resort if it is databased based.  JW /* Reads from latest draft */  GV Have this discussion before the XML discussion.  JW That's where guideline 6 comes into play - requirements for if you need   to provide a style sheet or other mechanism, etc.  Action WC: Add dynamically generated (from database) to open issues list.  WC Kynn - how's your XSLT with WCAG coming along? Want to demo?  KB Not sure that it will be ready, but could discuss.  WC People find that valuable?  GV Have to discuss after the normative/non-normative version so that people   know what to conform with.  WL In the checklist document, "if you are using tables, vs frames" etc is a   mini-thing of what we are talking about.  JW Yes, include on agenda. If using XSLT to create the versions, the XML   would have everything. That could be downloaded as the document set.  KB Try to have something available.  WL We are in danger of ignoring the "cyber-ghetto." This discussion reeks   of this issue. Possible that things like "final form" can be exclusionary.   /* part of the database discussion */  GR Having a floppy with agenda, documents, etc.would be helpful.  Action WC: Summarize agenda items. Propose times for handling.  CS Either now or on the list, discuss what groups of technologies we want   to discuss.    $Date: 2000/09/28 22:07:17 $ Wendy Chisholm      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello,    For those of you who help take minutes, you can now generate an HTML file   with the structure that I use.    Using a browser, go to: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/,new    You will have the choice of three templates. Choose,   "/WAI/GL/Templates/minutes.html"    It will give you 6 fields to fill in:  1. the date of the teleconference/meeting  2. the month of the teleconference/meeting  3. the year of the teleconference/meeting  4. the URI of the previous meeting minutes  5. Your name  6. A uri for you (a web page, an email address) or whatever.  (you may   leave this empty)    The date, month, and year are filled in with the date the page is generated.    This will generate a file with a long URI.  Save that file to your disk.   Rename it whatever you wish. Take minutes, then mail the file as an   attachment to the list.    Any questions?

      I propose that the evaluation for checkpoint 7.4.1 reads:  <blockquote>  This technique will be triggered by:  A META element with an "http-equiv=refresh" attribute value and a "content"   attribute integer value greater than 0.  If the "content" attribute is a URI this is an auto-redirect page.

      based on the discussion, how about this:  <blockquote>  Technique 13.6.1 [Priority 3] Verify if links should be grouped.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  Check for lists of links: Several A elements separated only by spaces,   bullets, or a few characters such as "] [" or " | ".  Check for groups of links: grouped with DIV, P, MAP.  Example Language:  none.  Repair Technique:  Ask the user if an identified list of links should be grouped.  If the user wants to group the links, use a MAP element (@@still   outstanding issues in WCAG w/this technique?)  Suggest that the user provide a link to bypass the group or that they move   the group to the bottom of the page or that they use a high "tabindex"   attribute value.  </blockquote>  At 05:09 PM 1/30/00 , Leonard R.

      I updated the Checkpoint mapping [1] to reflect the discussions from the 1   February [2] and 25 January [3] telecons.    Additions to the checkpoint mapping:  1.  We decided that WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 9.1 would be covered in the HTML   Techniques, therefore I added a row for HTML Techniques and associated   checkpoint 9.1 with it.    2. We decided that WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 11.3 would be covered either in   server-side techniques or core techniques, therefore I added a row for   server side techniques  and associated checpoint 11.3 with it.    3. The resolution on 1 February was to follow Jason's suggestions [4] for   everything that had not yet been agreed upon.  Jason was not clear which   techniques to associate  WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 13.10 (Provide a means to skip   over multi-line ASCII art. [Priority 3]).  I associated it with core   techniques, although it might fit with WCAG 2.0 checkpoint 2.3 (Give users   control of mechanisms that cause extreme changes in context.)  If this is   not appropriate, please let me know.    4. I associated WCAG 1.0:13.2 with WCAG 2.0:1.4  1.0:13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites.   [Priority 2] (if 1.4 is modified to include semantics)  2.0:1.4 Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of content.    5. 1.0:5.3 and 1.0:5.4  were associated with 2.0:4.2  1.0:5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when   linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an   alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version). [Priority 2]  1.0:5.4 If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for   the purpose of visual formatting.

      hi all,    Ian and I added some text to the browser support page [1] this a.m.  We   also created a page of tests for each checkpoint [2].    Please note the status of this document:  <status>  We are currently working on support by major browsers. As of 8 December   1999, we have begun to document the most current versions of Opera,   Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE), Netscape Navigator (NN), and Lynx. We   also intend to document information about older versions of these and other   browsers on various platforms as well as combinations of graphical desktop   browsers and dependent assistive technologies (screen readers, screen   magnifiers, and voice input software) that address accessibility requirements.    An associated Tests for the User Agent Support Page is also under   development to help us test support.  </status>    We need to finish creating tests for each checkpoint.  There are probably   some that we can borrow from the ERT.  Otherwise, we will need to create them.    Then, we need people to contribute information about a variety of browsers.    If you would like to volunteer for either of these activities, please let   me know.    Also note that this is not the highest priority for the group right   now.  Our primary concern is creating a new charter and closing open issues   (primarily checkpoint 1.3 and the null alt-text debate). I will be sending   a draft of a new charter within the week.    thanks,  --wendy    [1]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/UA-support.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Assigning guidelines to volunteers  In this week's discussion, we are looking for volunteers to take one   guideline and summarize and prioritize the related issues.

Some of these issues could be addressed in a  proposal by the   subgroup who took an action item last week (myself, Loretta, Doyle, Mat,   and Gregg), other issues might best be handled in a future draft.  The goal   of divvying up the Guidelines is to more quickly process public comments   and prepare our next public working draft.    [1] http://tinyurl.com/yn0s    3.

      excellent.    >- 5.5.2 Table Captions - removed (not required by WCAG)    i added this per WCAG discussion.  I will add this back in.      >Should we remove the 'discussion status' sections?

I would like to   get rid of as many of these as possible before we send it to IG, AU,   WCAG.

      Thank you Chris for taking minutes today.  Minutes available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2000/11/20-minutes.html    20 November 2000 ERT WG Telecon  Participants  ?       Daniel Dardailler  ?       Harvey Bingham  ?       Sean Palmer  ?       Michael Cooper  ?       Chris Ridpath (scribe)  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Dick Brown    Regrets  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Wendy Chisholm    Topic: Accessibility Description Language (ADL)  DD: Could we get a description of ADL?  SP: A language to describe how accessible a document is and describe the   accessibility evaluation. It could describe which checkpoints the doc   complies to.  DD: It's machine readable.  SP: It should be as technology independent as we can. Have to discuss what   it does. Language not discussed yet, but could be XML. Could also express   accessibility of CSS. We're now changing from WCAG 1.0 (which was HTML   based) to 2.0 which is more general.  DD: Use of RDF?  SP: Would be used, yes. It's metadata for doc.  DD: Like a schema?  SP: Could write a schema.  DD: Apply schema to document?  SP: If RDF used then does not need schema. List of elements in namespace.   Dublin core doesn't use schema.  WL: ADL purpose - expressed in RDF.  SP: Put ADL in module?  WL: Yes  DD: Has anyone looked at Amaya re annotation? We could use annotation   system to add accessibility evaluation. Stored in RDF.  WL: If people use constructs then assertions about comments. Could be   pointers to specific guidelines. Can't use XHTML with RDF without   modularizatrion.  DD: Don't have to use RDF within file. Could store in separate doc like Amaya  SP: Amaya doesn't have link to RDF file. Must consult annotation server   which is big problem.  DD: Link between doc and annotation is problem?  SP: yes. And validation in RDF is impossible.  WL: Could be linked like stylesheets use now.  SP: Must be standard. Need to know what the RDF file is.  DD: Issue 1 - use RDF or what? Issue 2 - How do you bind doc to ADL?  WL: Does modularization of XML solve this?  SP: Yes, as far as I know.  DD: to Sean - Is that a DTD module?  SP: it will be a DTD module. That's all there is. Limited to XML right now  DD: Modularization will help. XML schema is way of future.  SP: There is no release of XML schema for HTML.  DD: For ADL if we can create a RDF statements for doc then is usable. Can   describe accessibility for Java script. Example: can point to paragraph or   element and using RDF describe problem (color set or something). What tools   will use it? What is audience? How will it be used in 6 months or a year?  SP: People who create new languages. People who use new languages.  CR: We could use now in current evaluation tools. Could be used by browsers   in future.  WL: Detail is where it's at. Some conformance doesn't matter to some users.   Others matter. RDF will enable this.  SP: yes. Can create new languages from RDF.  WL: We have a problem with coding behind RDF but is transparent.  SP: yes semantic web. Has great potential if we work together. Tech will be   hidden to user.  DD: Thinking of charter: ER creates description. Other WAI groups have   input. Need common framework for XML designers. Real software could use this.  WL: Al Gilman suggests that cross working group task force.  DD: Who's going to face to face on Dec. 4 & 5 in Washington (ER & PF)? HB,   maybe BM, not DB, not SP, not CR  WL: phone conf could be used. Was OK in Bristol.  DD: We will look into. Agenda for meeting - have talk about ADL. PF group   can talk about XML. Look into future.  DD: Don't know outcome of ADL developments. What will they be?  WL: Will list conformance of doc.  SP: and more. Can mix RDF  DD: Has been discussion with Charles MN about putting accessibility   features in doc. As XML matures in industry, W3C will not be needed. But is   need to express accessibility info.  WL: Separate lang not needed. XML is too vague.  SP: XHTML is a display format while XML is data format. Modularization of   XHTML makes it more like data.  DD: (Suggestions for several uses of RDF).  WL: is XHTML 2.0 correct for that purpose?  DD: Why would you create XHTML WAI?  WL: If you could influence then it is OK. Can create XML TRACE brand,   right? DD: Right.  WL: Then let's do that.  SP: Can override XHTML. Is still display format. Is not pure XML yet. Need   to make changes to XHTML. We need module to change XHTML. Use RDF.  DD: Why outside of XHTML core family?  HB: Must be many XML dialects. Must do our job right.  WL: Don't bother with XHTML?  HB: No, serves a purpose.  SP: XHTML 2.0 is more pure. Very XML based lang.  DD: What do you mean by 'display language'?  SP: Modularization has a presentation module as a part of 1.1. If 2.0 is   accessibility then OK. Won't be though if namespace is still there.   Modularization allows for presentation markup. We need to add semantics to   presentation.  WL: If anti semantic then don't let in.  HB: Like converting <b> to <strong>.  SP: What about <hr>? We need to add semantic meaning to it.  HB: in SGML we wanted to separate structure and content.  SP: Attach behaviors to that?  HB: No.  DD: In 2.0 can still create presentation modules and are poorly designed.      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

      In the list of existing tools, there is a section called "filter and transform."  where does a tool like "popup killer" fit?  it's a tool for users. many of the filter and transform tools are also for users.  should we add a new section to the list for tools like this?    http://software.xfx.net/utilities/popupkiller/download.htm    --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

        #4 also contains the conformance level.    e.g., 1.1-1a  Non-text content that can be expressed in words has   a  text-equivalent explicitly associated with it.    1.1 is the checkpoint number  1 is the conformance level  a is the sequential number for that criterion    thus, 1.1-2a  would be the first success criterion (a) for Level 2 for checkpoint 1.1.    --wendy    At 01:31 PM 12/9/02, Cynthia Shelly wrote:  >I think it's important to be able to tell very quickly which criteria  >are the minimum, and have that info built into the numbering scheme.  #2  >and #3 both do this.

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2001/05/28-minutes.html    28 May 2001 WAI ER WG Telecon    Summary of action items and resolutions  ?       Action SP fix style sheet in EARL doc to work with older versions   of Netscape  ?       Resolved: Will continue to discuss at next week's joint AU/ERT   meeting: how to sell this to developers. What info can we pass to DiD to   convince harness developers to make harnesses generate EARL.  ?       Action CMN/WC: follow-up on AU/ERT discussion with DiD.    Participants  ?       Daniel - DD  ?       Sean  ?       Chris  ?       Wendy  ?       Dimitris Dimitriadis (from DOM WG) - DiD  ?       Charles    EARL 0.95  Action SP fix style sheet in EARL doc to work with older versions of Netscape  DD Where are the graphics? Are they linked from anywhere.  SP On my infomesh site.  DD Danny Ayers images were nice, perhaps link to?    Open issues from EARL Issues - Again, 21 May 2001  DD Don't think we can resolve until people use. Should maintain a page that   lists all of the issues and perhaps users can propose solutions.  WC Open ended questions versus do one way or the other. What about DAML   questions? Follow up with Dan C?  SP Yes, and several others and all seem ok. There are issues, but those are   within the RDF world.  SP Primary issue is prose - more prose in schema to identify what each   property means.  DD Should be self-documenting. Should we do it this way or have separate   documentation.  SP Dan and Tim maintain N3 and generate RDF and XHTML using XSLT.  DD We should work on XHTMLfile and use that to point at the documentation.  SP How much of definition in schema and how much pointing to the outside?  DD Primer - details, graphics, etc. Keep reference doc in the schema.  SP Refer to the primer as a whole? W/in schema point to primer?  DD We should have feedback from the user.  SP Expect some people prefer in documentation, other prefer to have in schema.  DD Currently EARL home page is primer, what we call primer is extended doc.   Instead should call the model something else. Right now, should work on   primer, documentation, and home page.  /* Dimitris joins - DiD*/  SP Dan suggests putting example on home page. However, might make sense to   have home page be short, move current stuff to primer and then rest to   documentation. Then, have one thing that links to everything.  DiD Good documentation but scattered. Not on entry point.  DD Move stuff from ERT home page to EARL home page. From there point to   schema, model, graphics, etc.    DOM Test Suite  DiD So far we have relevant parts of DOM spec in our own DTD. Interface and   method names - tests. We don't have any assertions in language. It has DOM   constructs and programming constructs - for, scope, negation, etc. We don't   have particular vocabulary for producing results. Perhaps a color-coded   table. If use RDF could "this person states the test is in accordance   w/spec" then crunch to generate actual result.  /* CMN joins */  DD Interactive tests?  DiD No. However, harness could generate EARL. Harness not the test suite.  CMN The harness is the place where you expect to use EARL. It uses pointer   to test suite.  DiD Can generate code, compare to test suite. What is the connection to EARL?  CMN "I pass this test and this one and this one" that is EARL.  DiD In addition need harness that's aware of tests, and can do   transformation for you. Harness is EARL aware, run test, listen to result,   generate EARL.  CMN Difference is instead of generating "pass or fail" you are generating EARL.  DiD More than happy to provide meaningful results. Only problem is that DOM   will not write harnesses. We will only provide tests and style sheets -   that's the test suite.  CMN Who is writing harness?  DiD Implementors themselves.  DD Speaking with my QA hat, implementors have to write additional code?  CMN Have to have code to test DOM anyway.  DiD Make it simpler by giving tests judged correct. A manual job before   test is released. Expected outcome.  CMN No requirement on creator test suite - they could do each by hand.  DiD right. I have no problem with that.  SP Use EARL to say that it passes tests suite?  DiD We do not make connection between spec and suite.  SP Conform to some id w/in the spec.  DiD Yes.  SP THen you can say that.  DiD Right. We can say that someone fails a test, and that that   implementation does not support DOM spec. This is not spec conformance.   Main question is, can we use EARL.  CMN I passed a test, what does that mean in a wider scope? What pieces of   the scope do I need to recheck.  SP I generated an example this a.m.  DiD Pass or fail one test. Test suite not to cover whole spec.  SP Doesn't have to be, but certain pieces. Passing all doesn't mean DOM   conformant. Any code that passes certain test case passes certain ID in   spec. However, if it fails certain ID, then fails DOM compliance.  DiD Then can localize the error.  CMN Another important use case is same specs pointing to same test. E.g.   "alt-text for everything" means 1.1 for WCAG. In U.S. 508, they have same   requirement. Therefore if i meet the test case I meet x in rule set y, and   a in rule set b.  SP I could do that tonight. In EARL, pass a test case. That gives   conformance to various rule sets.  /* various discussion about granularity and making inferences */  DiD Dom spec not granular enough.  CMN Still need to read the spec. EARL is not magic bullet. Problem w/spec   or the way the world is?  DiD When new tests added to framework, must be tied to spec. Also require   that submitted tests must have expected outcome. therefore, have all the   info necessary. The problem is enough info for me to do it, but not for a   machine. Ask yourself a question, but won't get answer since DOM spec too   high level. Have to ask the CML source.  SP Same problem as WCAG where not machine-readable. It's in prose.  DiD Right, DOM spec is XHTML, not granular enough.  SP Limited scope answers?  DiD Take collection of all similar tests and write assertion.  SP Right. Once done once, have it for next time. If do enough, in essence   have machine-readable form.  DiD Collection of assertions, but never how related to spec. It's not   machine readable.  SP Could not get inferences through all of the data. e.g. pass this one   pass all others. But could say, to some subset of that. Get some useful info.  DiD When I have a collection of tests, and you test "getNamedNode." you   have 5 tests. You can compare tests. The relationships are expressed in   machine readable. Attach to spec. Background color. Doesn't explain default   values.  CMN We're talking about URIs. to describe relationship between 2 tests -   have 2 URIs.  DiD How do you assert you want to do something w/the info that is pointed to?  CMN An assumption of EARL.  DiD What if x needs to be a string?  CMN Part of test suite. Test suite says, "do this 5 times." You say pass or   fail. If you look at CSS test suite. There are selector tests. You have to   pass 5 or 6 of them. e.g. selector can't begin w/a number. you have   incomplete result, it takes a lot of tests together to check for   implementing one piece of spec. Have to be clear if sufficiently tested.   One thing to do in harness is follow out the links. here's uri of what you   got wrong.  DiD You could do more simply by checking pass/fail and go to link of test.  CMN In WCAG, go to each checkpoint.  DiD Main question - other people are writing harnesses, how do we convince   them all to generate EARL?  CMN If you have more than one tool, they can take EARL input as well as   EARL output.  Resolved: Will continue to discuss at next week's joint AU/ERT meeting: how   to sell this to developers. What info can we pass to DiD to convince   harness developers to make harnesses generate EARL.  Action CMN/WC: follow-up on AU/ERT discussion with DiD.    $Date: 2001/05/28 15:35:40 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

      Hello,    I think others have clarified the intent of the second part of 10.1.  There   have also been a few suggestions on the list about how to warn users if a   new window will pop up or other ways to give the user control.    Here are two other neat ideas that I've seen (content solutions rather than   user agent):    1. On a personal Web site, I saw a short javascript that will let the use   decide if windows are to open in a new window or not.  The user selects a   checkbox.  This obviously only works if scripts are loaded.  Note that the   default is not to open a new window.  I think this is really elegant.   Here's the script:  <script language="Javascript">  // thanks to blogger  function targetLinks(boNew)  {  if (boNew)      where = "_blank";  else where = "_self";  for (var i=0; i<=(document.links.length-1); i++)  {  document.links[i].target = where;  }  }  //--></script>    One of the first things on the page is a checkbox:  <input type="checkbox" name="targetnew" onclick="targetLinks(this.checked)">    2. Optavia [1] let's the user know when they will go to a different site by   using an image with alt-text within the link.  You could do something   similar, but say "will open in new window." Actually, Optavia does this but   can't find an instance of it on their site (on a really quick skim of the   site).    Hope this helps,  --wendy    [1] http://www.optavia.com/rnd.htm  At 11:22 PM 5/29/01 , Graham Oliver wrote:  >Checkpoint 10.1 states  >'Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned  >windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to  >appear and do not change the current window without  >informing the user.'  >  >looking for clarification on the second part 'do not  >change the current window without informing the user.'  >  >Can someone tell me what this means please  >  >Cheers  >Graham Oliver  >  >=====  >'Making on-line information accessible'  >Mobile Phone : 025-919-724  >Work Phone : 09 846 6995  >AIM ID : grahamolivernz  >  >____________________________________________________________  >Do You Yahoo!?  >Get your free @yahoo.co.uk address at http://mail.yahoo.co.uk  >or your free @yahoo.ie address at http://mail.yahoo.ie    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

      I disagree with this suggestion.  I believe the points that are being   discussed are a WCAG issue not a tool issue.  Now is the prime time to take   these issues to the WCAG working group as they have begun thinking about   revising the guidelines - particularly to address cognitive and learning   disabilities and to generalize the checkpoints so that they are less HTML   specific.    Also, I don't believe enough credit is being given to what WCAG already   addresses in regards to low vision.    Here are some excerpts from WCAG 1.0:    Content developers must consider these different situations during page   design. While there are several situations to consider, each accessible   design choice generally benefits several disability groups at once and the   Web community as a whole. For example, by using style sheets to control   font styles and eliminating the FONT element, HTML authors will have more   control over their pages, make those pages more accessible to people with   low vision, and by sharing the style sheets, will often shorten page   download times for all users.    Content developers must consider these different situations during page   design. While there are several situations to consider, each accessible   design choice generally benefits several disability groups at once and the   Web community as a whole. For example, by using style sheets to control   font styles and eliminating the FONT element, HTML authors will have more   control over their pages, make those pages more accessible to people with   low vision, and by sharing the style sheets, will often shorten page   download times for all users.    (from the rationale of Guideline 1)  This guideline emphasizes the importance of providing text equivalents of   non-text content (images, pre-recorded audio, video). The power of text   equivalents lies in their capacity to be rendered in ways that are   accessible to people from various disability groups using a variety of   technologies. Text can be readily output to speech synthesizers and braille   displays, and can be presented visually (in a variety of sizes) on computer   displays and paper. Synthesized speech is critical for individuals who are   blind and for many people with the reading difficulties that often   accompany cognitive disabilities, learning disabilities, and deafness.   Braille is essential for individuals who are both deaf and blind, as well   as many individuals whose only sensory disability is blindness. Text   displayed visually benefits users who are deaf as well as the majority of   Web users.    Related Checkpoints:  2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available   without color, for example from context or markup. [Priority 1]    2.2 Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide   sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when   viewed on a black and white screen. [Priority 2 for images, Priority 3 for   text].    3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than   images to convey information. [Priority 2]  For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and style sheets   to format text and control layout. Also, avoid using images to represent   text -- use text and style sheets instead. Refer also to guideline 6 and   guideline 11.    WAC note: if markup is used rather than images, text can be displayed   however the user chooses.  the user can choose size, color, and font.    3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]  For example, use the CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT element   to control font styles.    WAC note: Again, this is giving control to the users.    3.4 Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute   values and style sheet property values. [Priority 2]  For example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or   'cm', which are absolute units. If absolute units are used, validate that   the rendered content is usable (refer to the section on validation).    WAC note: this gets at the issue that Len mentioned.  If relative units are   used, when the font is increased the layout should adjust so that there is   not overlap.    --wendy    At 09:36 AM 5/2/00 , Leonard R.

      Benjamin,    Please be aware that an Erratum was issued on 23 November 1999 that says   you do not need to use relative units on raster images.

        Bob,    Thank you for your review.  Your thoughts on minimum level conformance of   WCAG 2.0  are interesting.  Since we have been discussing the supplementary   materials, I want to follow-up on something you said in your review.    You said:  >However, I still think this document needs support in the form of   >techniques documents and training materials that are very, very specific.   >The training module written by Geoff Freed and Chuck LeTourneau for WCAG10   >was great but there needs to be several different documents explaining the   >new guidelines for different levels of skill in different fields.    Those pieces are not there yet, but will be.  We have been trying to better   understand the various types of  information required by different   people.  To this end, I drafted the basis of a usage scenarios document and   thoughts about technology-specific checkpoints. [1,2]    Any specific suggestions for what needs to be provided and how? What was it   about the training module that you found most helpful?    In the usage scenarios, do you see any skill levels that are not   represented?  If you do, could you give us a better idea of a user who you   have in mind?    FYI, WCAG 2.0 techniques info available at [3].

      I agree that this is a user agent issue.  It's already implemented in Opera   (4.x+), although it sometimes seems to hang with a document.open().

        I found the old issues lists, went through some old minutes, and found   contradictory interpretations of "Avoid deprecated features."    I propose the following erratum to WCAG 1.0:  10. Avoid deprecated features  Added: DD MM YYYY.  Type: Clarification  Refers to: Checkpoint 11.2 of 5 May 1999 version  Description (and correction). The checkpoint says, "Avoid deprecated   features of W3C technologies" but it is not clear if "avoid" means "do not   use at all" or "use only when absolutely necessary."  Since this is a   Priority 2 checkpoint, the stricter interpretation applies and it should be   read as, "Do not use deprecated features of W3C technologies."  Deprecated   features may be used in a site that claims conformance at Level A.  Level   AA requires more work, including replacing deprecated features with updated   technology.  ---    The other checkpoints that use the word "avoid" are also Prioirty 2 except:   "7.1 Until user agents allow users to control flickering, avoid causing the   screen to flicker. [Priority 1]"  There are a variety of issues with this   checkpoint ("until user agents...," how to test for flicker, what do we   mean by "avoid.").  This is a separate issue and should not impact the   clarification of 11.2.    ---  trail of minutes and issues lists:    At the 13 April 1999 meeting there was discussion about what we meant by   "avoid" but there was no resolution.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0015.html    Greg Lowney commented about an earlier draft and Ian responded that BLINK   and MARQUEE "should not be used."  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0470.html    In an old issues list for WCAG 1.0, there are still some open issues.  One   is related to this issue and it says, "We need to share our interpretation   that some use of deprecated is o.k. The CG feels we should either address   this in errata or the next version."  However, I am unable to find support   that this is the consensus.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html#g11    13 June 1999, Ian made the following proposal:  Change wording of 11.2 to read "Avoid deprecated features of         W3C technologies. Note: Authors should stop using deprecated         features when they are supported by by other technologies such         as style sheets."  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0191.html    I remember quite a lot of discussion about "avoid tables for layout" and   found some evidence of us changing from that to the current wording, "5.3   Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when linearized.   Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an alternative   equivalent (which may be a linearized version). [Priority 2]"  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0029.html    This wording comes from the 17 March 1999 meeting:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0466.html    History of issues lists:  1. WAI Page Authoring Guidelines Issues List for the Working Drafts (Pre-Rec)  (last modified Nov 2000)  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-wd-issues    2.

WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Issues List - Proposed   Recommendation  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-pr-issues#layout-tables  At PR, "Avoid tables for layout" was replaced with a clarified checkpoint:  5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when   linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an   alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version).

      Please note that the following appears in the errata for WCAG 1.0:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA    <quote>  8. Text in images - clarification of checkpoint 3.1.   Added: 3 January 2001   Type: Clarification   Refers to: Checkpoint 3.1 in 5 May 1999 version.   Description (and correction). Checkpoint 3.1 should be reworded to read, "When an appropriate markup language exists and is supported, use markup rather than raster-based images to convey information. [Priority 2]   For example, when supported, use SVG to create graphics, MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects. Avoid where possible using raster-based images to represent text -- use text and style sheets. Raster-based formats such as .gif and .jpeg paint the text as a series of pixels. When magnified the text becomes distorted. The ability to magnify text is critical for user with low vision.  You may use text in images when:   the text does not convey its literal meaning but has a more graphical function, such as a logo and   the effect can not be achieved with CSS and   you have provided a text equivalent for the image.   Refer also to Guideline 1, Guideline 6 and Guideline 11.  </quote>    Does this help any?    --wendy      At 08:54 PM 1/23/02, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >see checkpoint 3.2: When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup  >rather than images to convey information.  >  >and the discussion recently, and the discussion on the topic in the archives  >for the end of 2000 - there are a numbner of threads there that are relevant.  >  >If a navigation bar consists of *images of text* then I think it breaks that  >checkpoint.

      Annuska,    When you refer to "final version complete" - are you asking when WCAG 2.0   will be published as a W3C Recommendation?  We do not have a timetable for   going to Recommendation but my own personal opinion is that the earliest   this would happen would be by the end of the year.  Please refer to the W3C   process that we  must follow in order to publish a recommendation:   http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#Recs    As far as publishing the guidelines for external review, a public working   draft of WCAG 2.0 was published 25 January 2001 at   http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/  The deadline for comments on this draft is 22   February 2001.    Per W3C policy, it is recommended that we publish work for public review   every 3 months.    When WCAG 1.0 was published, we published the Techniques at the same   time.  I anticipate the same process this time when we go to   Recommendation, that all supporting materials will be published at the same   time.  Until then, we should have a variety of work drafts of all of the   documents and not necessarily published at the same time.  We will have   several subgroups focusing on different technologies and I expect drafts   from each subgroup at different times.  However, fresh versions of all   documents will be generated for public releases.    Have I answered your questions?  It would help me to know why you are   wondering about timelines. I am concerned that some people might see us   working on WCAG 2.0 and discount WCAG 1.0, when 2.0 is merely making 1.0   better and should not raise any major inconsistencies. in other words,   people should go ahead and use WCAG 1.0 since 2.0 won't be out for a while.  --wendy    At 05:58 PM 2/13/01 , Annuska Perkins wrote:  >Can someone please point me to the current schedule for rolling out the 2.0  >guidelines?

Divided the "Tables of data" section into: "Providing summary       information" and "Identifyin g rows and column information" and moved some       of the info to the "Linearizing tables" section .  Created a subsection called "Text for images used as links" in the "Link       text" section.  Deleted the suggestions to use "tabindex" in the "Grouping and bypassing       links" section.  Divided the "Image maps" section into: "Text equivalents for client-side       image maps", "Redundant text links for client-side image maps",       "Client-side versus server-side image maps ", and "Server-side image       maps". This required moving some content around, merging, dividing..et     c.  Linked to the "Grouping and bypassing links" section from the "Redundant       text links for c lient-side image maps" section.  Deleted the "Audio and Video produced by dynamic objects"  section and       incorporated it into the "Directly accessible applets" section.  Moved things around in the Scripts section to create the following       sections: "Graceful transformation of scripts", "Scripts that cause       flickering", "Scripts that cause mo vement and blinking", "Directly       accessible scripts", "Alternative presentation of scripts", " Page updates       and new windows".

      As I suggested before, I would really like to see a "WCAG in 10 points"   that is similar to the "XML in 10 points" [1].  Based on Al's and William's   terse statement of principles, here are some possibilities for the points:    Accessible Web content is a method for removing barriers to information.  Accessible Web content presents information without depending on any one   device or sense.  Accessible Web content separates structure and content from presentation.  Accessible Web content is highly structured and easy to navigate.  Accessible Web content is easy to understand.  Accessible Web content contains images, movies, text, applets, and scripts.    Others?  Thoughts?  [1] http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points    Al Gilman and William Loughborough have separately sent suggestions for   high level principles.  I have merged the two.  AG denotes Al Gilman, WL   denotes William Loughborough.    AG:: Leave no gratuitous barrier between the information and its consumer.    AG:: Transform gracefully into various views, don't depend on any one   device or sense.  WL:: Assure content availability across sensory modalities.  WL:: Permit user modifications of (recommended) default presentations.  WL:: Design user interfaces for device independence.    AG:: Separate the content that informs all views from the presentation that   is view specific.  WL:: Convey semantics using content, structure, and markup (or data models)   rather than presentation.  WL:: Separate content and structure from presentation; capture semantics   with markup.

      Finally, the resolutions from the March 2 F2F have been incorporated as   well as discussion from last week.  Latest draft is at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20010328.html    I have not updated the checkpoint mapping yet. Will do that before the   meeting.    Here is the change log info for this version. I've babbled about a few open   issues.  As I was publishing I realized a few more formatting issues and   thought of a couple more proposals, will send tomorrow.    --w    These edits are the result of feedback on the 25 January 2001 Public   Working Draft and discussion at the 2 March 2001 F2F and the 22 March 2001   telecon. Summary of comments on the 25 January 2001 public draft.  ?       Moved the preamble of Guideline 3 to the introduction. The preamble   discusses that these guidelines apply only to web content that has a user   interface and not to machine-readable only content.  ?       I began writing introductions to each guideline, but realized that   these intros seemed to fit in an executive summary or an introduction. So I   began writing an intro looking at the 4 guidelines, but quickly got mired   in my overuse of metaphors and decided to stop. Help is appreciated.  ?       Moved Checkpoint 1.6 to guideline 2, it is now 2.6  ?       Moved checkpoint 1.7 to guideline 4, it is now 4.4. Edited slightly.  ?       Edited checkpoint 2.1 it is now 2 checkpoints.  ?       Kynn originally suggested, "Provide a variety of navigation   mechanisms"  ?       At the 22 March 2001 call, we agreed on, "Provide more than one   path or mechanism to find content."  ?       At CSUN, KB, CMN, and WC talked about this. The point was made that   some places may only need one path to get to content, if the site is small   enough or simple enough. Therefore, I looked through Jakob Nielsen's   "Designing Web Usability" and found the idea of "user-controlled   navigation" on pg 214. I thought about using "Support user-controlled   interaction (including navigation)." But am concerned that this is still   too vague or too jargony. Also, checkpoints 2.3 and 2.4 seem to fold into   this which either means it a good basic principle or it is too general. It   basically restates the theme of this whole guideline. Therefore I went with   what we decided at the meeting on 22 March.  ?       Replace checkpoint 2.2 with the 2nd part of checkpoint 2.1. In   other words, deleted checkpoint 2.2. The new checkpoint 2.2 is the second   part of the old checkpoint 2.1.  ?       replaced the phrase "interaction behavior" with "responses to user   actions"  ?       found an interesting resource: Sample Chapter 5: Interface and   Interaction Design that talks about interaction as a conversation and   therefore that rules of politeness apply.  ?       Edited checkpoint 2.3.  ?       Moved checkpoint 2.5 as a technique of 2.1.  ?       Added lots of material to introduction. Began explaining the 4   principles of the 4 guidelines here rather than before each guideline.  ?       Added a catch phrase to each guideline (presentation, interaction,   comprehension, technology considerations).    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Last November we pulled together examples of technology-specific   checkpoints for CSS, HTML, XHTML, SMIL, and XML [1].  Today I went to   update it to reflect changes in WCAG 2.0 and realized that many of the   checkpoints were not stated as checkpoints.    In this new draft [2], I have borrowed heavily from the Techniques For   Accessibility Evaluation And Repair Tools (AERT) public working draft.  I   have only included a few checkpoints for HTML and only for checkpoint 1.1.    Hopefully, these two drafts can aid Thursday's discussion on   technology-specifics.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/checkpoints-20001108.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/checkpoints.html [in datespace at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/checkpoints-20010206.html]  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      The minutes are available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/20000504.html    I have also included them below.  Note that as I cleaned up the minutes I   found several points that needed follow-up.  Therefore, I assigned some   action items <smirk>.  These are obviously negotiable since people did not   accept them during the call. The only person who does not get off the hook   is Harvey, as he accepted the action to take a question to EO.   A few have   been "assigned" to WCAG WG in general and if everyone is supposed to do it,   no one will.  Therefore, it would be appreciated if people volunteered to   take them.    It was a very interesting call, but I'm not sure that the UA folks got all   of the answers they needed.    UA WG - what further do you need from WCAG WG?    thanks,  --wendy    04 May 2000 WCAG telecon  Joint telecon with the UA WG to discuss Structural Navigation issues  Action items and resolutions  HB suggest to the EO group that they need to raise consciousness with   advertisement aggregation companies (that's one place where alt-text might   be getting lost).  WCAG WG investigate the proper use of DIV.  GJR show what a possible blueprint migration from HTML to XHTML to XML   might look like.  WCAG WG create techniques that show how to use XML with a style sheet.  ?? Is it the case that when style sheets are used to convey presentation   that proper markup is used? Do pages that use style sheets use more   structure markup than those that do not use style sheets?  WC find examples of ISO-HTML pages that are conformant (i.e., have properly   nested headers).  WC check out ISO-HTML algorithm to determine structural divisions. take to   ER WG.  WCAG WG review AG's amazon rewrite.

Since   it's during WCAG I'll go ahead. Congratulations to JG for receiving an award.  JG "Academic professional excellence award." nominated by the college.   recognition by peers through the university. did not mention accessibility.  GJR so no minority opinions then?  JG they didn't talk to any UA WG folks.  JW essentially there is a longstanding issue with structured documents. if   the document structure has been marked up correctly, one could navigate   through it. knowing where one stands and then locate particular points and   then browse the document by kinds of content. e.g. moving through an   outline to read headings in order to provide an overview of the contents of   a document. there are issues that relate to both UA WG and WCAG WG. What   markup conventions should be used for the UAs to interpret? Two fold issue:  1. what can be retrieved from DOM. connection to hierarchy and XML tree   structure.  2. use of appropriate markup so that the structure is explicit.  Al has suggested that the document hierarchy is not isomorphic to the   navigational hierarchy, at least not in all cases. We need to consider UA   capabilities and future versions of WCAG to make sure they are in synch. In   SVG one has the advantage of identifying portions of an image. Concept of   structural hierarchy and navigating it. Can apply to documents, images, and   multimedia. Jon - want to elaborate on any aspects of the issues?  JG From what I see, there is agreement that the MAP element should be used   for collection of links. My understanding is that "title" attribute of MAP   should be a label for what the group of links is. The navigation issues are   still cloudy. For example, I've got different stuff on the page. I use   speech output. I go to Yahoo - navigation bars, ads, info, that is static   and a dynamic area. When linearized, the static stuff is at the beginning.   The 2 questions I have: can we mark up the 2 areas? MAP is clear, but what   about a list of phone numbers? A New York Times article? When someone comes   to the site they have to go through all of the links to get to the new   information.  CS would changing the page title help with that?  JG possibility. more specifically, is there an easy way for people to get   to the new info?  GJR individual pages should have individual titles. using a hotkey, someone   could quickly get the title. we should have invited henter joyce (HJ) as   they have support for this. Jaws will skip over what it has run into before.  DP on a shopping site, and click "buy" it leaves you were you were so you   can continue on. it's very helpful.  GJR another thing, that both Productivity Works (PW) and HJ do, is   structured navigation. the ability to move by element or header. these are   implementation scenarios. not sure if heuristics have to do with markup or   other techniques. we ought to find out what they are doing.  JG that's my main question: is this a UA function? rather than require more   work for authors, is there sufficient info for UAs?  JW depends on if there is structure in the markup. if lists, tables, etc.   are not marked up then it will be impossible for the UA to compensate. HTML   does not encourage the use of proper container elements to designate the   scope of content. Even tho headings may be used correctly, the section to   which it applies may not be clear since there are no specific container   elements.  CS might also work to have something like tabindex for named anchors.  GJR tabindex is allowable to put in named anchors but it is not supported.   HTML spec says that A element can take accesskey.  CS i want to define where people can go. it makes sense to skip over nav if   not using it. i want them to go to ads.  GJR offering blind user same functionality as sighted user. how many people   actually read the ads?  CS if you make it easy to skip over, developers will have issues with   funding. but my issue goes beyond ads.  GJR two-fold process. the functionality could be used to skip "foo" it   could be used to return to "foo."  JP the UA could use that info in the user interface.  GJR when we had the discussion on GL re: reformatting pages with Scott   Luebking I said that would not fly. authors don't want ads on the bottom.  RS and they won't want you to skip the rest.  GJR i don't see the difference between someone who goes to Yahoo and their   brain is trained to start at a certain place. despite things beeping and   flashing, they ignore. Most people when they get to a page with a lot of   ads will ignore.  DP I browse as a disabled user, one of my favorite things, is to go to the   first field on a form. i don't even listen to anything up to that point.  CS my concern is not so much for other users of auditory interfaces, like   the car computer, people who are supplying content will want their ads to   be read. the user and the author should have some control.  GJR yes, we need to be careful. there are times when you want that info.  JW no user should be forced to read anything on a page. as a print user or   speech user they should have a choice. it should be possible to avoid or   return to particular pieces of the content and to move through the   structure as quickly and easily as possible.  GJR I am loathe to use comparisons to hard-copy print media, but when   people read magazines, there are lots of gutters on the far right column.   some people go specifically for ads, some people don't. this is obviously   an issue wrestled with in other media. We want to satisfy both sides of the   equation: skip over and return to.  CS that's reasonable. my initial point was that i'm not certain that   existing markup handles this scenario rather than trying to find a kludge.  GJR interested if the kludges that are already in effect could point us in   a direction to solve the problem.  JW where is the markup missing? DIV could be used to denote block level   content. title could be added to it for human readable characterization.  CS not saying that there are missing feature, but that we ought to explore   it. DIV makes sense. but is tabbing between DIVs supported?  GJR but we can consider it here. Al has floated such a proposal. Here is   navigation section. here is content. etc. Ads are routinely skipped over by   people who are blind because there usually is not any info. You usually get   "click here" or file size. By not assigning alt-text to areas the areas   become useless.  JW we have techniques to markup image maps and correct markup for groups of   links. i don't think we have any discussion for the proper use of DIV   elements. links, tables, forms, are there because of distinctive markup and   can be readily identified. At one level, provide appropriate container   elements (DIV in HTML, group in SVG) there is the larger issue of whether   there are cases that even if this is done the tree that occurs in the DOM   corresponds to a good navigation tree. is there a need to provide support   for navigational features. that has an impact on UA capabilities more so   than markup. question of relationships that are not reflected in document   tree that need to be represented. AG raised it in his message.  @@WCAG WG investigate the proper use of DIV.  AG want to respond to CS question. i don't see any difficulty in devising a   markup plan that would work in the UA. I suggest using things like CSS   selectors to provide a precedence order, e.g. title vs no title. This is an   area for forward motion, but hard work. Won't fly unless we can present it   to the author. The author has to care about it enough to articulate the   structure.  CS and take the download hit as well.  AG perhaps 3% character hit.  CS we have hour long arguments about adding bytes of any amount.  AG interesting. we get very different reads on this issue. history with   LINK element to provide info. but it died because authors did not use. it   was not in the default presentation of the page. it is technically possible   to use a DIV tree...i'm concerned that we take the theory of the structure   and feed it to the author.  CS keyboard shortcuts and faster navigation for power users.  AG still needs to be something in the markup to drive the keyboard   shortcuts. it takes a while to tab through stuff if you use the tab order.  JW an absolute requirement (p2 level) that appropriate markup should be   used. we need to provide examples and make the necessity as clear as   possible...  RS in the next release of UAAG??  JG If just techniques, put in techniques. we have other checkpoints related   to moving to active elements.  GJR there is a responsibility of people who rely on advertising revenue to   set up standards that the content that they pull in reformulate pages.  CS e.g. banner ads. saying it should have appropriate alt-text?  GJR yes. and the container should be marked appropriately.  AG only in the actual graph of how many hands it pushes through, it is more   removed from chief editor of the page. my scenario: go to advertiser and ad   agency. if they want to provide alt-text, that's cool. but to the extent   not informative in audio, should get out of the way in audio.  GJR easy argument to make to advertiser: you're missing people. if they're   ok with that then ok  CS there are advertisement aggregation companies. that may be where   alt-text gets lost.  GJR suggest that to EO group. we need to raise consciousness with them.  DP that knowledge would be welcome.  @@HB suggest to the EO group that they need to raise consciousness with   advertisement aggregation companies (that's one place where alt-text might   be getting lost).  JW concerned that examples have all been so HTML-specific. With this next   version we are hoping to address wider variety of technologies. What type   of structure and semantics should be provided for different types of content.  GJR we could affect great change by using XHTML as baby steps for   authors...it's XML with training wheels. increasing functionality of it.   take the power of example. do a technique in HTML. then XHTML. then port   with use of RDF to XML. we have a blueprint for people to migrate to XML.  @@GJR show what a possible blueprint migration from HTML to XHTML to XML   might look like.  JW Yes, a great idea. One of the principal ways we can develop the   relationship between HTML and XML to show how structure will be beneficial.   In a generic markup language such as HTML there is a limited range of   semantics. In this context, MAP designates an image map or a navigation   cluster of links, generic DIV while useful to capture structure does not   give semantics. There are ways to address it, one of which is to use an   attribute (class) but we don't have conventions for values to use. Or use   human-readable title. But, there are issues with capturing specific   semantics in using general containers elements. Therefore, using XHTML   module with XML defined in it, with a style sheet....techniques need to be   developed.  @@WCAG WG create techniques that show how to use XML with a style sheet.  WL encouraging the use of CSS in effect causes the author to become agent   of structure insertion.  IJ misuse of style to convey semantics. sounds like since applying style   and adding semantics wrong way to go.  JW think the argument was that when using style sheets to convey   presentation, a tendency to use proper markup.  IJ would like to be shown that that is the case.  AG that is a good candidate for the survey - to survey what is out there.  @@?? Is it the case that when style sheets are used to convey presentation   that proper markup is used? Do pages that use style sheets use more   structure markup than those that do not use style sheets?  GJR a friend filling out a tax form, did not fill out a piece of it because   it was not in bold. people have been trained to look for style. it gives   people scannability.  IJ your argument is that there are semantics in style and that's a good   thing, but that you shouldn't convey semantics first through style.  AG I would not believe WL's claim based on what comes out of word. IJ -   ideal way of doing it. making distinctions is valuable. making them in   style sheet is more valuable.  JW there is a dependency. if proper markup is used, one can reflect the   structure using the style sheet in a particular presentation medium.   high-quality visual design is intended to reflect the structure and   semantic distinctions as clearly as possible. from author perspective,   consider that the markup captures the structure properties and style sheet   will act upon the markup to create presentation that captures distinctions.   then get rich rendering in the variety of platforms you provide style   sheets for. one thing we have not addressed is to highlight the   relationships between style and well-designed markup. there is an argument   in using markup and adding style to make sure the distinctions are   expressed in presentation.  GJR need to address. one of the more common uses of style sheets - to   supplement what is there.  WL rather than beautify it.  CS because people have to support older browsers.  JW even in XML document the purpose of the SS is to provide presentation of   semantics in the markup. one should think of dependency in that way and the   relationship between good markup and high quality presentation.  HB more than one style sheets for clients. the SS should be generic to an   XML application. with recursion, the style has to handle recursive objects.   those represent significant challenges for e.g. going from braille to   visual style sheet.  AG the SS ideally are not into the specific application but into the   vocabulary of app widgets - paragraphs or toolbars. i thought that one of   the things you said was the idea that, "who are designing people so that it   shows up well is radically different media?" people are getting more   interested with phone stuff in market.  WL that's why a "C" in CSS.  AG perhaps another one for harvey. i'm interested in WAI getting as smart   as can about industry. where find people practicing what we preach.  WL WAP  JG I have some immediate concerns. Not suggesting that any guidelines be   changed, but I am hearing about bridges to new technologies, are there   things that we can use beside MAP to markup this info? how long to   resolution? 3 months or so?  JW already today, the use of container elements and structural elements is   important practice. guidelines and techniques in WCAG already suggest how   to do that. at the block level that make up macro structure of document...a   generic markup language does not provide semantics. need to use generic div   elements. use title or class to provide semantics. in XML we have more   options. I would be interested to where were people think more work needs   to be done and what issues should be settled soon.  AG there are 2 examples that have constituencies in author population. in   ISO, they require that headers have to be nested properly. if there is an   HTML page that claims it is ISO-HTML you can apply their algorithm and say   these are structural divisions. Similarly, there are few people converting   from latex that use divs. I've been reluctant to say that UA should try to   get UAs in large to do this. It would only be beneficial for small   percentage of page problems.  CS but if in the UAs more authors will use it.  AG yes, definite chicken and egg philosophy. but want mock-ups to show   authors to sell them.  @@WC find examples of ISO-HTML pages that are conformant (i.e., have   properly nested headers).  @@WC check out ISO-HTML algorithm to determine structural divisions. take   to ER WG.

IJ seems to me that the topic that has been in UA for a while, "how should   the UA provide useful navigation and what can we get out of content to   identify them?" there have been many discussions about what is available in   markup and it seems that we end up saying, "there is limit to what we can   rely on in the spec and we need schemas." the dependency fell away and the   issue became more in the realm of UAs. given markup what functionality can   we provide. "allow the user to navigate easily to important components..."   but requires nothing special from authors.

      Hello,    I did some research in preparation for discussion at the face to face about   the illustrating text checkpoint. In previous drafts it was checkpoint 3.4   "Supplement text with non-text content."  In Gregg's latest proposal it is   checkpoint 4.1.    I prepared 2 sets of notes and referred to a 3rd set written in May   2001.  These  need more work but were used as part of Sunday afternoon's   discussion at the F2F.  [Minutes of this discussion are at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/24-f2f-minutes.html#illustrations]    We had good discussion at the F2F and I need to incorporate that feedback   into my notes.  However, I published the minutes from the F2F today and I   would like to publish the notes for those who were not able to attend.  I   will continue to work on my notes and I welcome any feedback.    1. Symbolic Languages instead of text-based language  quick summary:  what are the issues and how can we use technology to solve them?  Many of   these ideas look to the future. Still unanswered is what to do   today.  Gregg took an action at the F2F to draft a new checkpoint to   address the issues brought up in the discussion.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/symbolic-lang.html    2. Illustrating text  quick summary:  what are common uses of illustrations already in use on the web, what are   some possible technological solutions, and what needs to be considered when   creating illustrations?  This is more of an outline of the things to   consider than of solutions.  It feels like a techniques document rather   than success criteria for a checkpoint, but they are issues I thought would   help us design success criteria.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/illustrating-text.html    3. Wendy's unillustrated notes, thoughts, and questions about the recent   WCAG WG "Illustrating Guidelines" thread  quick summary:  In May 2001 I was trying to summarize an ongoing thread called   "Illustrating Guidelines."  In it I try to get my head around the issues by   summarizing the axes of discussion and the main points of discussion.

Right - you have to be aware that following the spec does not always   produce content that "works" because browers have not implemented the specs   consistently.  also, authors should take into account that newer specs have   deprecated features of older specs or introduced newer features that did   not exist in older browers.    >    What do you do in the case of presenting an XML  >    document without style sheets? How does that  >    transform gracefully without style sheets?    This checkpoint does not say that XML must be available without style   sheets.  That is one very obvious bug in WCAG 1.0 that we are not   replicating in 2.0.  In the case of XML, the transform requires style   sheets.  However, if the user's browser does not support XML then we might   have a problem.    >    I don't have a counter-proposal for this checkpoint.  >    I agree with the goal, but I think that it's  >    important to be more specific in stating  >    what's required of the author.    Yes, so do we but we haven't fleshed it out yet.  That's why this is a   working draft without consensus of the working group rather than a   recommendation or last call.    >Guideline 2: "Design content that can be interacted  >with according to the preferences and needs of the user."  >  >    I think that Guideline 2 and Guideline 1 statements  >    should be harmonized.

      As we discussed at the September face to face, Josh Krieger and Chris Ridpath have a set of at least 268 test pages.  We discussed going through those and then creating more.  They are available for download in a zip file at:   http://www.aprompt.ca/ATR/TestFilesHtml.zip    Also at that face to face, Charles Munat and I agreed to write a tool to help people go through the test files.  It was to serve 2 functions:  1. make the process easier for WCAG members to go through the test files  2. store results in EARL which would then help us create reports as well as provide a valuable implementation of EARL.    By saving the results of people's evaluations in a markup language, we can automatically generate reports to see where we agree and disagree.    Unfortunately for us (but happy for Charles) he has been busy with graduate work.  I've been busy with my regular workload.  Although, I am still very keen to see this through.  Charles McCathieNevile was also interested in this.  Since then, we have had some new faces join the ERT WG, so I might be able to get some help from them as well.  Although, as always, everyone is busy with their own things.    As always...volunteers will be appreciated.  --wendy    At 06:21 PM 12/4/01, Gregg Vanderheiden wrote:  >Absolutely.

      [13:08] <nick_kew> hi, I've been thinking about Page Valet+earl  [13:09] <nick_kew> I'm concerned about how to identify testSubjects  <wendy> what's your concern?  [13:10] <nick_kew> Basic testSubject should be the page being evaluated, right?  <wendy> yes, a URI  [13:11] <nick_kew> Now, that's fine for isValid, or Passes-WCAG-AA  [13:12] <nick_kew> But for the detailed output of Page Valet, it's losing lots of information  <wendy> you mean, you want to say ImageX is missing alt-text.  [13:12] <sbp> can you provide an example?  [13:12] <sbp> ah  [13:12] <sbp> well, then you have to use XPointer, or a line/column count  [13:12] <sbp> or map the DOM  [13:13] <nick_kew> Precisely.  If I comment on ImageX, I want to identify ImageX.  [13:13] <sbp> O.K.  <wendy> and then what ImageX fails is wcag1.0#text-equiv  [13:13] <sbp> so how are you identifying it in the PV output?  [13:13] <nick_kew> Now, that works fine *if* I make testSubject an internal anchor in the Normalised source generated by Valet  [13:15] <nick_kew> Is that something I can reasonably do?  [13:15] <JibberJim> I don't think so as no-one else will have your normalised source.  [13:15] <JibberJim> Can you construct XPointers?  [13:16] <JibberJim> (which hopefully won't differ between normalised and non-normalised source.  [13:16] <nick_kew> XPointers into what?  It's no use unless the original is well-formed XML  [13:16] <nick_kew> - which most Web docs aren't  [13:16] <sbp> er... I presume that you're addressing it by column and line number, right?  [13:16] <nick_kew> No, sbp  [13:16] <sbp> so what are you using?  [13:17] <sbp> or is it indictinct?  [13:17] <nick_kew> The normalised source comes out as  [13:17] <nick_kew> <sp element name="h1" id="e11"> .... </sp:element>  [13:17] <nick_kew> and the tests have an IDREF to the element  [13:18] <nick_kew> <sp:element name="h1" id="e11"> .... </sp:element>  [13:18] <nick_kew> (typo correction)  [13:19] <sbp> right. so: [ a earl:WebContent; :partOf [ earl:reprOf <http://blargh.org/> ]; a :Element; :name "h1"; :id "e11" ] .  [13:19] <nick_kew> One solution to this would be an XHTML+EARL approach, analagous to XHTML+XML  [13:19] <sbp> you can probably borrow :partOf from one of Tim's namespaces...  [13:19] <sbp> XHTML+EARL?  [13:19] <nick_kew> <html> ......  [13:19] <JibberJim> But Sean, that would be Valet specific, I couldn't translate the e11 into an h1 in my tool.  [13:20] <nick_kew> <div id="earlreport">  [13:20] <nick_kew> <rdf:RDF ...>  [13:20] <sbp> Valet specific: well, it must get converted into something less specific  [13:20] <nick_kew> <earl:Assertor...>  [13:20] <sbp> less specific to SV, that is  [13:20] <sbp> why embed the EARL in the XHTML? You can't say "this bit of RDF talks about the element in which it is embedded"  [13:21] <sbp> you can point to the element using line number, XPointer, DOM, or whatever, though  [13:21] <sbp> I feel as if I'm missing something rather important  [13:22] <nick_kew> - so the testsubject can be an IDREF within the report  [13:22] <nick_kew> Can't.  [13:22] <nick_kew> Most web docs aren't well-formed XML  [13:22] <sbp> you can still use line/column on them, though  [13:22] <JibberJim> I think we need a fuzzy kind of HTMLPointer  [13:22] * sbp browses the http://valet.webthing.com/page/wcag.cgi?url=http://www.w3.org/&fmt=XML&wcag=0 source  [13:23] <nick_kew> Can't.  Don't have that info available in the normalised source  [13:23] <sbp> well, we'd need a canonical HTML parser to do that  [13:23] <JibberJim> surely an xpointer like thing pointing to the basic structure and attributes would be possible?  [13:24] <sbp> if you ran it through HTML Tidy...  [13:24] <JibberJim> html/body/image[src='moo.gif']  [13:24] <sbp> assuming near-decent SGML, yeah  [13:24] <nick_kew> <font><p><blockquote><b>this<i>and</b>that></font> ...  [13:24] <sbp> but what if there's some odd SGML error barfing the validator? You can only use line/column ni that case  [13:25] <sbp> if you don't have that information, I don't know what you expect to do  [13:25] <nick_kew> The XML (and HTML) report formats include full normalised source, precisely so as to have a reference point for the messages  [13:25] <JibberJim> How about the EARL in that case being "this is really bad" and not worry about specifics in the EARL.  [13:26] <sbp> since the output IDs are obviously case-by-case specific, they seem rather pointless  [13:26] <sbp> full normalized source: good  [13:26] <JibberJim> The HTMLPointer could have a confidence level against it?  [13:27] <nick_kew> I want a testSubject referencing somewhere in the normalised source, as opposed to the original source  [13:27] <sbp> so do it by ID  [13:27] <sbp> you have IDs for every element and attribute!  [13:27] <JibberJim> That would be no good nick_kew - as other people won't have your normalising parser available so will not be able to swap.  [13:28] <nick_kew> It can work if the normalised source is part of the same report  [13:28] <nick_kew> - provided this can be represented in a way other tools will understand  [13:29] <sbp> SP doesn't seem particularly set up to have other tools understand it  [13:29] <nick_kew> yes, sbp, I have IDs.  But original docs don't  [13:29] <sbp> what exactly do you want to identify within the EARL report?  [13:31] <nick_kew> When I report an issue, I want the report to identify exactly what element in the original doc it's complaining about  [13:31] <JibberJim> Wendy - http://jibbering.com/snufkin/ has a working Annotea client now - just looking at putting EARL in, but I'm not sure of the point!  [13:31] <sbp> hello?  <wendy> not sure of the point?  [13:32] * sbp is having network problems...  [13:32] <JibberJim> Well, We can't query the EARL using the Annotea interface, we just get given it, I think a more generic EARL database would be better.  <wendy> hmm. i thought the point of http://www.w3.org/2001/08/AnnoteaOxygenDemo.html  <wendy> was to query using the annotea interface...  [13:33] <sbp> the element in te original document: and therefore, you need someway to identify that element as it is in the originial document. As I have said, the is limited to line/column (possible a range), or XML DOM/XPointer. If it's not XML, you'll be wanting to use line/column. If you don't have that information, then what else can you do?  [13:33] <sbp> s/originial/original/  [13:33] <JibberJim> I like the idea of an HTMLPointer that's fuzzy.  [13:33] <sbp> I like the idea too  [13:35] <sbp> http://www.w3.org/2001/08/AnnoteaOxygenDemo is rather odd  [13:35] <JibberJim> Fuzzy is probably accurate enough, you only need to find the nearest matching in the parse tree, which isn't too hard with DOM (that I use for such things)  <wendy> how would a fuzzy htmlpointer work?  [13:35] <JibberJim> Just like XPointer, but wouldn't be accurate :-)  [13:35] <sbp> well, you generally know how to parse an HTML document: some end elements are implied, and there are empty elements hither and thither...  [13:36] <sbp> but if you couldn't parse it, what would be the point of HTML?  <wendy> is there any way to use hash to get this stuff?   [13:36] <sbp> you could just extract the bit of content in question, make sure that it's unique, and then use that  [13:36] <sbp> if not unique, give the index number  <wendy> al had an interesting idea at the F2F:  <wendy> it was an svg and xforms interface.  [13:37] <nick_kew> harumph.  Element id is index number, but how useful is it  <wendy> you'd have the source of the doc and mixed w/it EARL. using xforms, you would query each element  <wendy> for its bit of earl.  [13:38] <JibberJim> it's not safe as we don't know how many implied elements your parser has put in - or do you?  <wendy> he was using svg i think for the visual presentation.  [13:38] <sbp> .google XForms implementations  [13:38] <xena> XForms implementations: http://www.w3.org/2000/04/xforms-pressrelease  [13:38] <sbp> .google real XForms implementations  [13:38] <xena> real XForms implementations: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms/2000Jun/0035.html&e=921  [13:38] <nick_kew> Jim, I know that, you may not if your parser's different  [13:38] <nick_kew> That's why I'm not happy with it!  [13:39] <JibberJim> but if you know how many you included, and what index it is, you know the real index in the sourec?  [13:40] <nick_kew> No, my parser doesn't know whether implied things (like <html>, <head> and <body>) are there or implied  <wendy> doesn't the dom give us a "fuzzy html pointer?"  [13:40] <nick_kew> visval will put in <head> if necessary, thereby upping the element count  [13:40] <JibberJim> We have wellformed HTMLPointers, but only on our normalised source.  [13:41] <nick_kew> If your parser doesn't, then we're not compatible  [13:41] <nick_kew> Yep, jim, that's exactly it  [13:41] <JibberJim> it depends if the Fuzzy HTMLPointers can survive different normalisations   [13:42] <JibberJim> Is Open SP's normalisation compatible with IE's normalisation.  [13:42] <nick_kew> I've no idea what IE's normalisation is  [13:42] <JibberJim> It's very close to OpenSP's actually!  [13:42] <JibberJim> For HTML4 at any rate.  [13:43] <sbp> normalization differences: hence the "fuzzy" in "fuzzy HTMLPointers"...  [13:43] <nick_kew> Hmmm .. maybe a bit of trial-and-error?  [13:43] <JibberJim> I reckon that in practice they'll be accurate enough.  [13:43] <nick_kew> sbp, the pointers won't be fuzzy.  Jst right or wrong  [13:44] <nick_kew> So I can say testSubject = http://www.foo.org/subject.html#e42  [13:44] <JibberJim> I'm using Fuzzy in the sense you'll say   [13:44] <JibberJim> html/body/table/tbody/tr/td/img[src='moomin.gif']  [13:44] <JibberJim> and I'll have  [13:44] <JibberJim> html/body/table/tr/td/img[src='moomin.gif']  [13:45] <JibberJim> but it won't take us much to find the same image in that instance.  [13:46] <nick_kew> Jim, will you have html/body stuff if the source omits those elements?  [13:46] <JibberJim> I would in my parsers.  [13:46] <JibberJim> but as we know they are optional in HTML, someone implementing Fuzzy HTMLPointers would know it should look without those.  [13:47] <JibberJim> As in if it doesn't have an HTML, your parser probably stuck it in. Same as if you don't find an HTML, you know it's optional so stick it and try again.  [13:48] <nick_kew> hmmmmm..  [13:48] <JibberJim> We know what elements are optional, therefore we know what elements may or not be needed in the Fuzzy Pointer.  [13:49] <nick_kew> But that still leaves us with  [13:49] <nick_kew>  html/body/table/tr/td  [13:50] <nick_kew> - which table  [13:50] <nick_kew> -which tr   [13:50] <nick_kew> ...  [13:50] <JibberJim> Well that's the XPointer syntax - do you know XPointer?  [13:50] <nick_kew> With the help of a reference   [13:51] *** sbp has quit IRC (Homer: 20 dollars? I wanted a peanut!)  [13:51] <JibberJim> Xpointers in Annotea seem to work reasonably well, and they are using Amaya to enter them, and IE to read them back... (for me.)  [13:51] <nick_kew> I'm just thinking this is looking significantly harder than referencing the normalised source by ID  [13:52] <JibberJim> yes, but that's specific to you!  [13:52] <nick_kew> Well, for everything Page Valet has done hitherto, that's not been an issue  <wendy> chris ridpath asked these questions when he was working on a-prompt. he kept wanting to create a version of the HTML w/EARL embedded.  <wendy> are there arguments against doing that?  [13:54] <JibberJim> fuzzyPointer( /html/body/table[2]/tr[1]/td[0]/img[src='moomin.gif'] )  [13:55] <nick_kew> That's what I want to do, wendy.  <wendy> are jim and sbp arguing against that?  [13:55] <JibberJim> the [src='moomin.gif'] isn't XPointer I don't think.  <wendy> jim - it would be "img/@src='moomin.gif'" (if i remember correctly...)  [13:56] <JibberJim> yeah that sounds likely!  <wendy> or img[@src='moomin'gif']" depedning on what you're doing.  [13:56] <nick_kew> I think I'll try that anyway  [13:56] <JibberJim> What HTML source and EARL combined?  [13:57] <nick_kew> - maybe do other things too  [13:57] <nick_kew> yep, Jim  [13:57] <JibberJim> I wouldn't be able to take that and combine it with my report though :-(  <wendy> it seems you ought to be able to say, "earl:testsubject [bunch of html code] passes checkpointx"  <wendy> or something like that, right?  <wendy> then, it's still in EARL, but you don't have to worry about ids.  <wendy> i guess the issue then is order of the html  [13:58] <nick_kew> Well, I'm thinking in practical terms.  Do what I can first, then extend it to do what you want ...  <wendy> and replication - if bits of code have more than one issue...  <wendy> oh well.  <wendy> i'm sure you'll come up with something interesting nick  <wendy> it certainly is an issue.  [13:58] <nick_kew> wendy, can do that easily, but it's going to generate horrendously big reports  <wendy> i'm glad you're pushign it. this is the type of feedback we need to stabilize the language.  <wendy> make it robust and good.  [13:59] <JibberJim> Do you not like the Fuzzy HTML Pointers?  <wendy> yes, it would be horrendous.  <wendy> fuzzy is good. :)  [13:59] <nick_kew> Jim, need to think through that one  [13:59] <JibberJim> Okay, I'll let you think...  [13:59] <nick_kew> duh  <wendy> should we post the log of this to the list?  [14:00] <nick_kew> if you like  [14:36] <JibberJim> Wendy?  <wendy> yes?  [14:36] <JibberJim> I've got some EARL into the Annotation database...  [14:37] <JibberJim> What do you want me to do with it now?  <wendy> :)  <wendy> can it be viewed through the annotea client?  [14:37] <JibberJim> Erm.  Mine (because it's IE, and doesn't understand the application/rdf+xml mime type doesn't at the moment.  [14:38] <JibberJim> I don't have any other annotea clients to know.  [14:38] <JibberJim> If you've got Amaya handy...?  <wendy> i do have amaya handy.  [14:38] <JibberJim> Then look at my annotation on http://jibbering.com/earl/ and see what you get.  * wendy tries  <wendy> i need to select an annotation server - help?  [14:40] <JibberJim> http://annotest.w3.org/annotations  [14:40] <JibberJim> Assuming you've got a username and password?  <wendy> jim - ok. i got access to the server (an automatic process!) - i get an error:  <wendy> there were some orphan annotations. You may see them with the Links view.  <wendy> however, nothing shows up in the links view.  <wendy> an amaya problem? wendy configuration problem? or jim's annotation problem?  <wendy> ah. apparently the problem was me.  <wendy> i do get that message, but i now also see links.  [15:05] <JibberJim> Links?  [15:05] <JibberJim> What links? and what message do you get?  <wendy> 1. i select "load annotations" in amaya  <wendy> 2. a window pops up that says, "Annotation load: there were some orphan annotations. You may see them with the Links view."  <wendy> 3. from the "view" menu i select "show links"  <wendy> 4. in the links view I see some links. one is marked as an annotation. another is marked as an annotation with a question mark.  then, there is a list of other links.  <wendy> ---  [15:07] <JibberJim> And this is on my url? http://jibbering.com/earl/  ?  <wendy> yes  [15:07] <JibberJim> but it only has one annotation on it!  [15:08] <JibberJim> and it shouldn't be orphaned it was applied to the HTML element!  <wendy> i don't have the latest version of amaya...i should probably upgrade.  <wendy> when selecting the annotation, instead of viewing it it saved it to disk. odd.  <wendy> let me upgrade and see what happens.  <wendy> hold on a few mins.  [15:09] <JibberJim> That's because it's sending the incorrect MIME-type for the EARL wendy.  <wendy> ah.  * wendy looks at what was saved  [15:10] <JibberJim> I'm not sure if it's a bug in my RDF, or a bug in the Annotea server, I need an RDF expert :-)  [15:11] <JibberJim> well maybe not an expert, just someone better than me...  <wendy> ah. yep - it's downloading your rdf.  <wendy> did you send it by sbp?  [15:12] <JibberJim> Yes, he told me that syntax.  <wendy> hmmmm. what about ralph or ericp?  [15:13] <JibberJim> And the RDF validator, does what I expect, I think it might be a bug in the Annotea server.  [15:14] <JibberJim> Shall I post to the Annotation list about it and the problem?  <wendy> hmm. dunno. have you talked w/eric and ralph? do you want me to?  <wendy> yes! do that.  <wendy> although...  [15:15] <JibberJim> I've never met them other than in passing.  <wendy> let me upgrade first to make sure there isn't anything wrong w/my client.  [15:16] <JibberJim> They're definately sending the wrong mime-type, the question is more if they are sending the wrong mime-type because I've send them the wrong one or not!  <wendy> :)  <wendy> ok. confirmed that there is an issue. definitely raise it w/the mailing list.  [15:24] <JibberJim> So what do you think my browser should do with the earl it gets?  <wendy> well...having not used your browser yet (eeks, will do soon)...  <wendy> for a start, how about showing the earl?  [15:24] <JibberJim> It's just IE.  <wendy> it would be cool to use sean's earl to xhtml transform to display it.  [15:25] <JibberJim> url?  [15:25] <JibberJim> It's in python though - my browser doesn't talk python...  <wendy> fyi - all earl imps that I know of i've listed at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/#earl  <wendy> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Sep/0012.html  <wendy> no, it's xslt not python    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium   web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Hello folks,    I've been playing around the last few days with EARL schema possibilities.  I've gotten rid of blank nodes, which seemed like a good idea.  Is it an improvement?      Sean and Danbri, Libby said this was "implicit reification."  What are the implications on queries?  I haven't played or thought much about that yet.    I've worked 2 examples.

      hello,    i drafted an initial "non-w3c technologies techniques" module at [1].    Not much info there yet, but thanks to Robert for some interesting info for   Flash. [2]  I have not tested these techniques yet, but assume Rob has.  I   figure we could include screen shots from the Flash Generator tool.    There is more info to include from Robert and the PDF Info from Tim and   Marti (once it's ready).    It is definitely rough and needs to be cleaned up, but i wanted to take an   initial pass.    thoughts?    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/non-w3c-techs.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec/0030.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    This is a reminder that the review period for the Techniques for Web   Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 ends on 15 August 2000.  The text of   the request sent to IG on 27 July 2000 is available at:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000JulSep/0204.html.  That   message includes an explanation of the purpose of the document, the status,   the address, and where to send comments.    Thank you in advance,  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/04/18-minutes.html    Summary (also available in the minutes)    - Is checkpoint 1.1 testable?  JS, LR, and GSW agreed to go through some   test files and report conformance on them.  We hope this will highlight   issues with the checkpoint and perhaps lead us towards providing more   helpful informantion in determing conformance. WAC will send a list of test   files and general instructions to the list to get people started.    - JW proposed a new success criterion to Checkpoint 1.2.  However, there   are several conformance issues with this checkpoint.  Therefore we will   leave discussion of this proposal until we have a new draft with a   conformance scheme.    - Regarding the R1/R2 proposal, we decided to combine them as CMN proposed   (with minor editorial edits):  The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of people   with disabilities. However, the users of WCAG 2.0 are a wide audience, and   the requirements it expresses must be in language that policy makers can   understand, cite and adopt. While the WCAG WG does not set policy,   harmonization of accessibility requirements helps drive demand for   supporting implementations in Web applications.    - We discussed conformance in general.  I missed a lot of this discussion   due to questions from the plumber.  I think the gist is that GV will   publish a new draft before next week's meeting that will include an initial   conformance scheme and it will include some idea of site's publishing their   own review policy...or coming up with their own.    - Agenda items that we did not get to today:  1. Checkpoint 2.1 (in Gregg's reorganization). The following wording has   been proposed to address issues of device-independence in this   checkpoint:  all functions can be operated via character input  2. Treatment of real-time events under checkpoint 2.2 and how these can be   made accessible.  3. Lee's email about flicker and how the eye works  4. Lee's proposal for color contrast success criteria    - Reminder to review the list of open action items -   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/action-items.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      hello all,    We realized at our last call that tomorrow is a holiday for several people,   but we decided to go ahead with a call.  We will discuss issues but take   them to the list to reach full conclusion (as we should anyway since those   who call in are a small minority of our entire working group).    Agenda for 11 Nov telecon.  4:00-5:00 Eastern +1-617-252-1038    1.  Review action items from last telecon. [1]  2.  Discuss the charter wish list.  [2]  3.

      Hi,    I propose that the short technique phrase should be able to stand on its   own (as in a checklist).  I also think that the repair should not be   implied in the short phrase since some may have several potential repairs.    proposed short phrase examples for Checkpoint 1.1 - Provide a text   equivalent for every non-text element:  <proposed short phrase examples>  1.1.A -  Check IMG elements for valid "alt" attribute  1.1.B - Verify that valid IMG element descriptions ("longdesc" attribute or   d-link) are provided where necessary  1.1.C - Check INPUT elements of type="image" for valid "alt" attribute  1.1.D - Check APPLET elements for valid "alt" attribute  1.1.E - Verify that valid APPLET element descriptions are provided where   necessary  1.1.F - Check OBJECT elements of type="<image MIME types>" for valid   text  equivalents and descriptions (where necessary)  1.1.G - Verify that valid OBJECT elements of type="<audio or video MIME   types>" text equivalents are provided where necessary  1.1.H - Check FRAME elements for valid "longdesc" attribute  1.1.I - Check AREA elements for valid "alt" attribute  1.1.J - Check SCRIPT elements for valid equivalents where necessary  1.1.K - Check A elements for valid text content  1.1.L - Verify that valid text equivalents are provided for PRE and XMP   elements used to create ASCII art.  </proposed short phrase examples>      [note that in the discussion of the techniques, MIME types are as defined   in ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types ]    Note that I added a technique for the A element and arranged the order a   bit so that OBJECT element techniques were together.    These would replace the current text for Checkpoint 1.1 - Provide a text   equivalent for every non-text element.  <current>  Technique 1.1.A - Check images ALT text  Technique 1.1.B - Check images for LONGDESC and descriptive link  Technique 1.1.C - Check input buttons that use images for ALT text  Technique 1.1.D - Check applets ALT text  Technique 1.1.E - Check applets for alternative content  Technique 1.1.F - Check objects for alternative representation  Technique 1.1.G - Check frames for an associated LONGDESC file  Technique 1.1.H - Check AREA elements for ALT text  Technique 1.1.I - Check if audio files have an associated text transcript  Technique 1.1.J - Check SCRIPT element for an associated NOSCRIPT element  Technique 1.1.K - User notification for ASCII art  </current>    if this proposal is excepted, I will go through the document to rewrite   each phrase to fit this form.    thoughts  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

AU WG  http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter3  To complete the development of accessibility guidelines for authoring   tools, and to perform initial assessment of implementation of these   guidelines by authoring tool manufacturers. These guidelines should address   how authoring tools can:  provide author support for creating accessible Web documents;  ensure an accessible user interface for authors with disabilities.  Assessment of implementation is expected to allow improvement to the   supporting documents produced by the group, and if necessary to begin   revision of the guidelines themselves.    3:45 -4:00 break    4:00-5:00 Planning  What needs to be done?

      The list of techniques documents is available from the WCAG WG home page at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/#20-techs    Note that there are several documents not started.  Currently, the most momentum is behind CSS and HTML, although we are always looking for help.  Do you know SMIL or SVG or are you interested in learning?   If so, there are accessibility notes that could be updated and transformed into techniques documents.      Also, feel free to review any or all of the existing documents and give feedback.    We have an issues list for the CSS document and one for HTML Techs is in the works.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/css-tech-issues.html    Are you able to draft a proposal for any of these issues?  Keep in mind that on 1 November we divided the 15 sections of css techs into 3 groups.  Joel took responsibility for the 1st five sections, Jo for 2nd set of 5, and Matt the 3rd set of 5 sections.  They'll be coordinating the coding and testing of techniques for those sections.  Therefore, check with them first.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001OctDec/0297.html  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-CSS-TECHS/    Thanks,  --wendy    At 04:26 PM 1/29/02, Slaydon, Eugenia wrote:  >Sure.

      At last week's joint teleconference between the AU WG and the ER WG, it was   suggested that the ER WG's scope should include evaluation of tools.  The   scope of the ER WG has been evaluation of Web content, although we do keep   track of tools that perform evaluations, repair, and transformations.  At   this time, we would not like to expand this scope.    We anticipate continuing the work on test suites (sample pages) to help   tool developers determine if they have correctly identified accessibility   issues on a page (i.e. implemented AERT).  However, this is different than   the request that we heard from AU WG which was to develop a tool (similar   to the Web Accessibility Report Tool) that would help developers determine   their conformance to ATAG.    The minutes from our call where we discussed this are available at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      This workshop is to be help 3-4 April in Washington, D.C.  Position papers   are still being accepted.  For those of you concerned about conformance   with WCAG, particularly those of you developing evaluation and repair   tools, this workshop should be of interest.    I hope that people working on EARL are well represented since recording   conformance will be an important aspect of this activity.

        There are several questions in this email. Please respond in-line to each   question or group of questions.    Yvette, Takayuki, Lisa, Shadi, Charles - I ask language-specific questions   at the end of the email.  I appreciate feedback on any of the questions   that you wish to answer.    There are several tools that people can use to select a word in Web content   and look up the meaning in a dictionary.  Examples include:    1. "CleverKeys is free software that provides instant access to definitions   at Dictionary.com, synonyms at Thesaurus.com, and more ? from almost all   Windows or Mac OS programs, including word processors, Web browsers and   most e-mail programs. With CleverKeys, the answers are just a click away."  <http://www.cleverkeys.com/ck.html?p=home&os=>    2. In Opera, you can, "Translate words in other languages, or look them up   in a dictionary. Simply double-click on a word, or right-click on a   selection."  This is #10 in the list at:  <http://my.opera.com/community/tips/oneliners/>    Do these methods, and similar ones like them, satisfy the four   "programmatically located" aspects of 3.1?  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-WCAG20-20040311/#meaning>    Here are some tests (with CleverKeys for Windows) and questions:    1st Success Criterion to test: Level 1, #2  - "The meaning of abbreviations   and acronyms can be programmatically located."    Test 1: go to the W3C [1], highlight the second instance of "W3C" in the   first paragraph, press control+L to activate CleverKeys.  [1] <http://www.w3.org/>    Result 1: It lists the correct expansion of W3C   <http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=%20W3C%20>    Question: Does this satisfy the success criterion?  If so, is it a user   agent feature instead of an author responsibility?  If not, what more does   the author need to do?  If it satisfies the criterion, do we need the   criterion?  If we keep the criterion, is user agent support a sufficient   technique?    Test 2: go to the W3C [1], right-click on the second instance of "W3C" in   the first paragraph,  select "dictionary" from the pop-up menu.    Result 2: It does not list the correct expansion of W3C  <http://www.infoplease.lycos.com/search.php3?in=dictionary&query=W3C>    Question: Does this fail the success criterion?  If it fails, is it a   failure of the user agent or of the author?  If the author, what should the   author do?      2nd Success Criterion to test:  Level 2, #2 - The meanings and   pronunciations of all words in the content can be programmatically located    Test 3: go to the W3C [1], highlight "specifications" in the first   paragraph, press control+L to activate CleverKeys.    Result 3: It finds a definition for "specifications" -   <http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=specifications>    Question: Does this satisfy the success criterion?  If so, is it a user   agent feature instead of an author responsibility?  If not, what more does   the author need to do?      3rd Success Criterion to test: Level 2, #3 - The meaning of all idioms in   the content can be programmatically determined.    Test #4: go to ESL idiom page [2], highlight "beat around the bush," press   control+L to activate CleverKeys.  [2] <http://www.eslcafe.com/idioms/id-list.html>    Result #4:  It displays the result for "beat."  In the results is a list of   idioms that contain the word "beat" - including "beat around/about the bush   - To fail to confront a subject directly."  <http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=beat%20around%20the%20bush>    Question: Does this satisfy the success criterion?  If so, is it a user   agent feature instead of an author responsibility?  If not, what more does   the author need to do - link directly to the definition of "beat around the   bush" instead of the general "beat?"    4th Success Criterion to test: Level 3, #1 - The meaning of contracted   words can be programmatically determined.    Test #5: go to cybernothing [3], highlight the word "can't," press   control+L to activate CleverKeys.  [3] <http://www.cybernothing.org/>    Result #5: The results begin with "cant" and further in the list is "can't   - Contraction of cannot."  <http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=can%27t>    Question: Does this satisfy the success criterion?  If so, is it a user   agent feature instead of an author responsibility?  If not, what more does   the author need to do - link directly to the definition of "can't?"    Language questions:  1. Are there similar tools and dictionaries that are freely available in   other languages?  2. Assuming there are similar tools for Dutch, how would the results differ   for Dutch words that are aggregates of words? As with idioms, will tools   look for the meaning of each separate word?  3.  What about Japanese?  Hebrew? Spanish? Arabic?  German? French?  Are   there similar tools for these languages?  What issues would tools have in   other languages?  4. If automatic lookup of words works for some languages and not others,   how do we create guidelines that will apply across languages?  5. If the tools are possible, but not available today, do we write "lowest   common denominator" guidelines that apply across all languages, or do we   have different guidelines depending on tools available today?  6. Is user agent support a sufficient technique?    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

The latest draft of the requirements document--any comments?  Techniques document, open issues.  Guidelines, checklists and associated deliverables: any issues arising   before or during the meeting, in so far as we have time to discuss them.    Action items  Done. Refer to note to list on X June 2000. Action: JW draft a comment   about how the technologies fit together.  In progress. Action: CMN and MK checkpoints for MathML.  Done. Action: JW take issues of ETA to WAI-CG  Done. Action: WC ask Jon Gunderson about UA - can we install it and use it?  Open. Action: JW, GR, WC check out bugzilla as potential issue tracking tool.  Done. Refer to note to list on X June 2000. Action: JW search for other   issue tracking tools.  In progress. Action: WC send issues from techniques doc open issues to the   list.  WC Checked with JG about tool. W3C not crazy about installing. Will proceed   with issues list as is for now. Bugzilla?  GR No time to play with.  JW Documentation mentioned JavaScript. Perhaps install on test server to   play with. May have time to play with in the near future.  Action WC: Investigate JG tool further. Find out about potential security   issues. Try to get it installed on a W3C machine for testing.  WC going through techniques open issue.  JW only those that become controversial will get escalated to discussion on   a telecon.  /* Agreed */  WC CMN suggested combining technology-specific checkpoints with the   generalized checkpoints that we generated over a couple teleconferences.  JW yes, before do that, combine the technology-specifics, like HTML and CSS   as suggested in my e-mail last week.  Action: WC combine technology-specific checkpoints as suggested by JW then   incorporate them into the generalized checkpoints as suggested by CMN.  GR I took an action item to ask Glen Gordon and Mark Hakinnen how they skip   over blocks of text. In relation to UA navigation mechanisms. They have not   responded.  WC more of an ER item?  JW take it to UA and ER once you find out?  GR yes.    Draft requirements document for version 2.0  JW any reactions or comments? It is about to go through review by other groups.  WL no.  WC JB and IJ gave me feedback.  JW A few comments, but can't remember exactly what they were. I'll send   them to the list.  WC We need to send this for review to AU, UA, PF, ER, EO, and IG. Usually   we say, "please send comments to wai-gl." However, what do people think   about asking AU, UA, PF, ER and EO to send comments to wai-gl, but ask IG   to keep comments on wai-ig? The intent is to infuse IG with a high-level   WCAG discussion in the hopes of brining about ideas that might not have   come if they are asked to send comments to wai-gl. Also, to raise the level   of awareness in the IG of where we are headed.  GR we should tell them to cross-post.  JW Groups will usually try to come to consensus and then send comments to   the group asking for review.  WL IG doesn't work like that. [it should be] Anyone can make a comment and   it has to be answered.  JW prefer that people send prepared comments. If IG discuss internally and   formulate a mail with the various points of view.  GR We'll need designated GL trackers for the IG list. They would try to   shape and guide the discussion. In the end collate something. Pass by IG.   Send to WCAG.  JW Who is interested in doing that?  WL We're all on there.  Resolved: ask IG to discuss Requirements document on IG. Other groups will   send comments to wai-gl list. Those of us on IG will contribute to the IG   discussions to keep them focused and moving forward.  WC when should we send it to the groups?  JW after incorporate comments to JB and IJ?  Resolved: Send draft Requirements document to other groups for review early   next week.    Techniques document open issues  JW several sent to the list.  Action: WC incorporate GR's corrections to XHTML checkpoints.  JW GV is working on reformulation of guidelines. It will be proposed to the   list soon. That will allow us to write a first draft.    Face2face meetings  WC Australia in November? Who could make it?  WL possible maybe.  GR possible maybe. Also see if I18N group wanting to meet at the same time.   Could draw from the Pacific Rim.  WC Need to have more face2face meetings to move revision along quicker.   Thoughts on dates? places? Conferences we could piggy-back off of? I would   like to see a long term schedule.  GR Really like the idea of one in Melbourne, especially with WBU we could   draw some people.  WL I've never seen any mention of South America.  JW W3C tends to concentrate around areas where it has host institutions.  WL Pretoria in August. <grin>  JW One in November is a possibility since RMIT has offered to host the meeting.  WC Getting a core group of people there is an issue. It is not guaranteed   that WAI will be able to help get people there. Money will be tight for   this trip.  Other issues?  JW Cognitive has not appeared. We're working to set up a telecon that   interested parties will be able to attend.  WL Has anyone looked at Jonathan's notes for a talk he gave? They were   posted to the EO list.  Action WL: send the URI to Jonathan's notes to the WCAG WG.    $Date: 2000/06/08 21:03:30 $ Wendy Chisholm  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Summary of action items and resolutions  - Action HB Will ask Jim Rebman about how the WAI activity might fit into   the Colorado program.  Will steer him towards Judy.  - Action HB will talk with Judy about adding references that KHS gleans   from Len's page to WAI resources pages.  - Action KHS In contact with people for conference Len was putting   together.  Will put in contact with WL.  - Action WC: finish work on javascript stuff ASAP!!!  - Action WC get caught up on DIWG list (search archives for EARL) give some   support why use.  - 18 June meeting is cancelled. Next is 25 June.    Participants: Chris, Harvey, Wendy, William, Katie, Sean    CR Funding to work on tools? e.g., to add EARL to A-prompt.    WC Possible interns from UW DOIT program, if programmers can steer towards   stuff like that.    HB What about WAVE?    WC Would like to see what Temple comes up with.    HB Won't be until September, need something sooner.  What about recent   grant to Colorado?    WC/CR don't know anything about.    Action HB Will ask Jim Rebman about how the WAI activity might fit into the   Colorado program.  Will steer him towards Judy.    /* lots of bridge problems */    KHS  agrees to go through Len's home page to bring references to WAI   stuff.  Assuming will go under EO.    Action HB will talk with Judy about adding references that KHS gleans from   Len's page to WAI resources pages.      EARL    SP I had an actio nitem to chase up CC/PP and EARL. The author could have   cc/pp settings, not sure what it is for.  Perhaps context of "here are the   cc/pp settings that are making the evaluation. needs to be more structured   so we know exactly what the settings are and what expect back. We need a   property  should fit well together. Will go through again.    SP Link to cc/pp setting that tool or author has.  Send a request and   result based on cc/pp settings.    WC Way to report findings from tests on server-side generation.    SP How to point at it from EARL.    WC Anyone else doing?    SP Not many implementations.  Perhaps jigsaw.    WL What does "XML representations of arbitrary languages(Javascript, CSS,   etc.) (BNF to XML)" mean?  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/#earl    SP So that we can point into anything in EARL.    WL Way to explore javascript for accessibility?    SP Possibly.    WL Concerned about this.    HB Capture output stream and analyze it.    WC Working slowly on a couple tools. Yes there will be a JavaScript   techniques document.    Action WC: finish work on javascript stuff ASAP!!!    WL What about Flash?    HB Who working with?    WC Don't think anyone working with, attended WAI meeting in December,   haven't heard anything since then.    WL In contact with Mike Williams about getting version of Flash generator.    Action KHS In contact with people for conference Len was putting   together.  Will put in contact with WL.    /* discussion about DIWG, EARL, RDF, namespaces, etc. */    WL Could you send a note to DIWG about EARL?    Action WC get caught up on DIWG list (search archives for EARL) give some   support why use.    WL Working on requirements doc, benefit accessibility a lot.    Next meeting    18 June meeting is cancelled. Next is 25 June.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

      Hello,    Could someone tell me if Jaws, Window Eyes, Home Page Reader, et al give   some indication when html code elements have been encountered?    e.g. here's a code snippet  <html>  <body>  <p>here's some text</p>  <code>here's some code</code>  </body>  </html>    When "here's some code" is read - does it give indication that this is   code?  Visually, it is usually shown in a courier font (to make it look   more machine-like i suppose).  Just wondering if there is also some audio   indication.    Could you please include the version and platform of the product that you   are using?    Thanks,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/09/07-minutes.html    07 September 2000 WCAG WG telecon    Summary of action items and resolutions  ?       Action: WC add to open issues list: do we need to add specific   language to guidelines that say that metadata is text equivalent for   non-text equivalent.  ?       Action: everyone take a stab at suggesting simpler language    Participants  ?       Jason White  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Lisa Seeman  ?       Marshall Jansen  ?       Loretta Guarino Reid  ?       Katie Haritos-Shea  ?       Cynthia Shelley  ?       Andi Snow-Weaver  ?       Dick Brown  ?       Kynn Bartlett  ?       Gregg Vanderheiden    Agenda  ?       Principle 1  ?       Principle 2  ?       Principle 3  ?       Principle 4  ?       Others    Principle 1 - explicitly mention metadata?  [From the agenda: Does guideline 1.1 need to be clarified specifically to   include metadata? Can it too easily be misconstrued as excluding it, given   the historical usage surrounding the term "text equivalent" in WCAG 1.0?   Current wording: "1.1 Provide a textual equivalent for every non-text   (auditory or graphical) component or multimedia presentation." Do you favor   Andi's suggested restatement of the guidelines under Principle 1...]  JW Is metadata explicitly included or excluded?  WL Is metadata different from text?  JW There have been previous discussions w/SVG where you could provide   metadata not in itself be a paragraph of text or a textual presentation but   it would specify the relationships.  WL There is metadata that is not text?  JW Yes, text but it has more than text in it. Is there metadata not in a   markup language not represented textually? CAn be but not the point. It can   specify relationships between elements as well as text or embedded within   an image file and not in the markup language. My concern is we need to make   it clear as to what counts as a text equivalent.  WL I don't think you can make it clear. I don't think it's a problem.  JW Other reactions?  CS What is the problem?  JW Interpreting the guideline.  WL Vote to put on back burner.  Action: WC add to open issues list: do we need to add specific language to   guidelines that say that metadata is text equivalent for non-text equivalent.  WL At this time will not add specific language to guidelines that say that   metadata is text equivalent for non-text equivalent.    Principle 1 - andi's rewrite  WC Should consider other suggestions that have come in, such as those from   Al and William. I also sent some just before the meeting.  GV Characteristics or principles. Principle would be, "Do this or don't do   this." rather than a characteristic, "it has this."  JW WC raised things that characterized requirements in relation to outreach   and the role they should play in the framework. Andi had proposed   reformulation of the guidelines under 1 and William had written a draft   introduction to accompany principle 2. Both are trying to make the text   comprehensible.  KHS My action item was to have different people look at this. Web person,   marketing, or management. When those folks come to the page they need,   "policy makers go here." Something that can be printed out and in   generalized terms. Web masters need something more specific and you don't   have to get so broad. Almost separating into principles, guidelines, and   checkpoints.  LS I made a piece of software once that required same info at different   levels. Even if you went to the wrong place, you would end up where you   should be.  KHS From a manager, I heard "having a link is great, except when you go to   print it out." Lots of people will print and then look at. I went to search   engines and w3c was link on most of those sites, but they were to the WAI   or W3C, it needs to open up on our page not the main W3C site. University   of Ohio linked right to WCAG 1.0.  JW The WAI website is not under our control that needs to be discussed with   EO. The question we are trying to decide is what kind of materials and   explanations should be provided in the text of the guidelines (the   normative document) we are responsible to publish.  WL Before we get too deep in explanatory materials, I want to get back to   something Gregg said in our first meeting. It's the source for all of that.   It's not something that you read casually.  GV Yes, that was the original intent. But events have overtaken us. People   say you must follow these guidelines they don't say you must follow the   book that interprets them. What we're finding is that people are using the   guidelines and trying to fix their web page. Some go to the techniques   document. Also, people who bounce off of them because they are too complex   make up their own list. They throw away those that they don't understand,   rewrite to be less accurate, and never look at ours again.  CS Isn't that the same thing w/all of the W3C specs? A lot of people run a   validation tool and never look at the spec.  GV But people are being legally held. We don't want to end up with a   proliferation of standards. Einstein quote: "Everything should be as simple   as possible but no simpler."  CS It seems there is a lot of overlap between HTML specs and our docs.  GV But many in our audience never look at the HTML spec.  LS Once you've understood the principles you understand the checkpoints.  JW But those who can read HTML spec can read our doc.  KB But, people will be expected to read WCAG but not expected to read HTML   spec.  CS By taking exactness out of guidelines making less usable by those who   can read specs.  WC Still want something like XML in 10 points. In March, we agreed on a   short overview, a guidelines document, technology-specific tests, etc.   We're still talking about those things discussion hasn't changed.  GV Overview won't help those who don't read technology specs. The card is   wonderful but it is nothing more than simplifying what is in the guidelines.  LS PEople don't use it since they don't know how to implement it.  GV It does get used but, we need something more thorough.  DB People think "that's all I have to do." It's too simplified.  GV Yet extremely powerful to decrease fear.  CS It's better than doing nothing.  WL The arcane, holy grail should be there and we should work on it. We   don't have to concern ourselves with what we've written as long as we can   understand then we can tell them what it means.  GV Can't do that if that's the only one that people will conform to.  CS There are a lot of people who need the arcane knowledge.  GV That's fine, that's the technical reference manual behind the guidelines.  JW No, the technical reference is what is needed.  GV Currently the techniques document is informative.  JW The Guidelines are the reference, the only thing that is cited.   Techniques is explanatory and examples.  GV I said technical reference not normative or informative.  JW The guidelines are the precise accurate specification.  KB Precise and accurate does not negate making it easy to understand. I   realize that we have differing opinions on our core audience, but this is   part of our problem. In the real world, the core audience is numerically   larger and looking at more than the more technical audience. People don't   say, "refer to Kynn's site." they say, "look at WCAG." As long as they do,   they will be reading this specification. We need to make it readable and   not just say they can read a translated version or they are not really   supposed to read the technical version.  JW Can anyone propose a rewrite which would achieve that? Is it possible?  KB I don't see the dichotomy. I think simpler language will make it easier   to express what is meant.  WL If there is a proposal that does that, we can deal with it. So far I   have not seen that.  GV We are more in agreement than we think. What we need is something   technically accurate. If we can do that simply that would be better than   arcane terms. The conflict is that some people believe we will sacrifice   accuracy for simplicity.  KHS Perhaps we don't worry about the length of the document as long as   people can find what they need. It doesn't have to be short, it has to be   extremely understandable. It shouldn't have to be read from beginning to end.  GV Judy and the steering committee have said that if we want to have a long   document, we also need to create the short version.  KHS You have different audiences. That makes sense. The definitive   reference needs all of the information.  LS The terminology can avoid the problem, "I have my checkpoint list."   instead of calling it a summary, "introduction to..." Then they know they   haven't got every detail.  JW Summary of issues and progress. We have a large measure of agreement. An   introduction to the concepts is something I've been thinking about. Much of   the difficulty is a conceptual one. Certain ideas, like textual equivalent,   semantics, etc., need explanation. WL proposed a explanation of distinction   of structure and semantics. It could be used in an introduction. We could   write an explanatory text that is reasonably short that explain underyling   concepts. The the guidelines provide the technical detail.   Technology-specific components are in checklists. This is one possible   format. WC proposed something that we haven't had a chance to read. We can   then progress and avoid dealing in abstract but looking at concrete proposals.  KHS We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The fact sheet, getting started, etc.  WL Those don't cover the specific concepts.  WC /* reads from characteristics and principles */  GV Good that we take several stabs at what the high level principles should   be. We have goals and principles. Principle: separate structure and   presentation. Goal is to ... Let's put goals up front followed by   principles. Might be easier to sell.  JW One of the great features of the 1.0 guidelines, are the rationales   provided for the guidelines. There are other items on the agenda related to   the principles we've been working on.  KHS I like them Wendy. The one thing that summarizes them is "removing   barriers to information."  GV That is the essence. That is what accessible means. What does that tell   you? Accessible web content is removed barriers.  KHS It is redundant.  GV "easy to navigate" are characteristics. These are the ones that will   help us. If you design it accessibility it will be easy to navigate does   not tell you how to do it. But it lays out the results.  WL Everyone has to take a knife and stick it in if we're going to slay Caesar.  KB Do we have specific feedback from people using the 1.0 version. I have   not seen a summary of what's wrong.  WL We had a huge thread about how long it was.  WC Have gone through archives of IG and wai to find patterns of questions.   Many myths exist. Lots of questions about HTML specifics.  LS I could guinea pig it on the class I am teaching.  CS really interesting data. But, don't want to go far in the direction of   beginners. I think most people will know HTML. We have to be aware that   most of audience is technical.  WL We are probably unaware that people that many people will take one look   and not comment.  GV We are dealing with technology, we can't make it non-technical. Those   who want to simplify need to make suggestions.  LS We have 2 pieces of homework: rewrite less technically without losing   anything and come up with principles.  GV Those are related. Principles in understandable language will make   everything else that follows.    The old Principle 3  JW I had an action item to try to rework the document. I ran into some   problems in doing that. Those are the underlying basis of some of the   issues on our agenda today. One of my action items was to determine what in   principle 3 needed to be reintroduced.  /* scribed missed some discussion */  JW Not sure how to reformulate a general principle to cover. The original   principle 3 failed to cover: if you design a markup language, you need to   write one or more style sheets to convert it to something that the UA can   process. If we can talk about PDF, there is a similar requirement regarding   character encoding. We have problem relating coding in which info is   expressed in what the UA can process.  LS A filter?  KHS A communication device.  JW Can take many forms. I could write an auditory style sheet in a new   language. In PDF the mechanisms are there.  LS A filter. When people work on various markup language can write filter   to change from one to another.  KHS Doesn't that fit under principle 5 - compensate for older technologies.  LG Is there complete information and where it comes from? Do things need to   be provided to UAs that are more dynamic today?  JW That's the problem, it didn't arise with HTML but with the newer   technologies. It's always existed with font encodings but that's a   different matter.  LG When I think of XML and definitions that need to be provided for each use.  WC Assuming that including guidelines for new languages. Kynn has suggested   that we keep them separate.  CS How do we apply more general guidelines to emerging guidelines.   Therefore, perhaps a third prong. Like, sever-rendering. In WCAG 1.0 there   are techniques that I have used that I believe are accessible that do not   conform to WCAG. Since WCAG 1.0 is HTML specific. That's a third thing,   people who are creating new technologies, people using new technologies,   people using accepted technologies.  JW I read an announcement somewhere that there are graphical tools to allow   people to create their own markup language w/out knowing XML syntax. With   XHTML and related technologies, it will be easy to introduce new elements   and meanings. Therefore difference between content creator and language   creator will blur. What I'm talking about can apply to people not even   writing own languages. But, if you are using an encoding of some sort and a   probability that the software at the other end will process it, it will   need infrastructure.  WC Don't see how that differs from device independence (principle 4).  CS For language creators, need to be able to support alt-text.  JW Question not of device independence but of software.  LS Add an extra bullet, "when writing a new language, do x y z" under each   guideline. Then people see as a recurring theme.  KHS OR move to principle 6.  ASW There is an XML Accessibility draft.  WC Incorporating those into the technology-specifics. Refer to current   draft for 1.1.  LS If we promote XML accessibility now, then when people start making XML   Protocols, they'll be more likely to do it on the right foot. Most people   are beginning to look into XML.  MJ I disagree, many people despise XML and XHTML it's just more to learn   and HTML provides all that they need.  LS They might not want it, but know that is moving towards.  CS Depends on how you define web developer.  WL There are still more COBOL programmers than C programmers.  MJ HTML won't go away.  KHS As long as XML is coming, cover it.  LS I'm not saying we shouldn't make the situation better with HTML, but   there will be a segment moving to XML and we have an opportunity to   position ourselves to do things right the first time without having to put   out fires.  JW Good discussion but no resolution on the question I was raising.  Action: everyone take a stab at suggesting simpler language.    $Date: 2000/09/07 21:43:31 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hi all,    Judy asked that I update the list of existing tools [1] so that more   information is provided for each entry.  She asked that I use EO's list of   browsers as a model [2].  It's my understanding that EO had several   discussions to determine the information that ought to be provided for each   entry.  I have only edited the first four entries.  So far, I have been   including:  1. name/URL  2. who it is from  3. brief description of what it does  4. does it run locally or on the server  5. what platform does it run on    is there other information we should provide for each tool?    ratings?

      Hello,    My proposal for AERT Technique 13.6.1 is as follows.    <blockquote>  Technique 13.6.1 [Priority 3] Grouping links.    Discussion status  The suggested authoring technique is not widely supported by user agents.    Evaluation    Triggers  Several A elements separated by  spaces, bullets, or other characters such as "] [" or " | "  BR elements,  LI elements,  TD elements (i.e. A is the only element in a series of TDs, or A with inner   IMGs are the only elements in a series of TDs)    Requirement  Links should be grouped by MAP elements.  Provide information about the   group in the "title" attribute.    Repair    Triggers  User has identified a list of links that should be grouped.  User has identified that they want to include a link to skip over the group   of links.    Actions  If the user wants to group links:  If the links are contained in a P element, replace the P    element with MAP element.  If the links are in a list, enclose the list in a MAP element.  If the links are the only content of a table, include the table in a MAP   element.  If the links are not the only content of a table, then ??? how do you help   the user separate the links into something that can be included in a  MAP   element???    If the user wants to bypass a group of links and wants to include a link on   the page:  Insert an A element with a "name" attribute and a "tabindex=1" just after   the group of links.  Insert an A element just before the group of links and link to the A   element just created before the group of links.    Refer to the suggested techniques from the section in the HTML Techniques   for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 called  "Bypassing and   Grouping Links."  </blockquote>    Comparison of proposal and existing text   [http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#group-links]    1. I made the Evaluation section a definition list and listed the elements   that trigger this technique as "Triggers."  2. I modified the list of evaluation triggers since I felt the description   of table was too limiting.  3. Deleted the "suggested message" since at the 12 June telecon we decided   to link to examples rather than provide example text. [minutes -   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000612.html]  4. Changed "Suggested repair" to "Repair" and divided into 2 sections:   Triggers and Actions.  5. Included details about how to perform the repair (Actions).    With this format, these techniques are separated from discussion of the   interface.  Instead of saying, "ask the user if they want to create a group   of links" which opens a whole box of worms we can say, "once the user has   decided to group links..."    Should we link to particular sections of ATAG10-TECHS that discuss the   interface?  If we don't have examples, should we mock some up?    thoughts?  --wendy    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Ian and I took an action item at the 10 August 2000 telecon to propose a   clarification of 7.4 based on the discussion on the call [1].    Here is the proposed text:    <proposal>  8. Clarification of checkpoint 7.4  Added: xx August 2000  Type: Clarification  Refers to: Checkpoint 7.4 of 5 May 1999 version  Description (and correction): Checkpoint 7.4 says,  <blockquote>  Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not create   periodically auto-refreshing pages. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML,   don't cause pages to auto-refresh with "HTTP-EQUIV=refresh" until user   agents allow users to turn off the feature.  </blockquote>    This checkpoint is trying to address two issues:    1. Disorientation due to unexpected changes in content. Users should   expect  changes in content when they follow a link or submit a form.   However, the author may cause unexpected changes to content by using   scripts or other markup. The author should inform the user of changes that   will occur without explicit user interaction.  For example, if pressing a submit button will cause an intermediate page to   appear before the final results are displayed, inform the user in advance.   In short, warn the user of what will happen without their explicit interaction.    2. Response time not long enough to interact or comprehend the content   before it changes.  To ensure that users can interact with and understand   content in a time frame suitable to their needs, do not cause automatic   content changes at regular intervals (such as a page of stock quotes that   is updated every 3 minutes).    There is an "until user agents" clause that is not yet satisfied for this   checkpoint.  Note that the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines will require   user agents to provide the ability for users to update pages manually.  </proposal>    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/08/10-minutes.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello all,    This was my first solo experiment using the scripts to generate all of the   modules and it appears something has gone awry.  Gregory has  reported that   links to some of the alternative versions of the documents are broken. For   example, the link to the text version and the zipped archive version of the   HTML techniques module are broken.  Also, the link to the "latest version"   doesn't go to the latest version of techniques but to the guidelines in   general.    I will not be able to release a fixed version until next week since I am on   the road today through next Wednesday.    Thank you for your patience,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        Avi, Lisa, and Lee,    Thanks for the proposal.   I really like stating these as questions.  Just   a couple quick comments before we start the telecon.    >1. Your site lists in metadata the cognitive skills or reading age that  >a user would need to understand the important content.    I want to point out the work going on in the Dublin Core Metadata   Initiative Education group on labeling the audience of content.  Please   refer to a working draft from 2000:   http://dublincore.org/documents/education-namespace/    I am trying to figure out the current state of the DC-Education  proposal.    >4. Terms that should be familiar to the intended audience audience are  >favored over terms that are less likely to be understood.    >9. Disabled users within your audience are likely to understand any  >abbreviations or acronyms.    there is a level 2 success criteria under checkpoint, "Checkpoint 1.6   Provide information needed for unambiguous decoding of the characters and   words in the content." that reads, "abbreviations and acronyms are clearly   identified where they occur." and it references checkpoint   4.3.  "Checkpoint 4.3 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar   information with summaries and definitions." which has a level 1 success   criteria that says, "acronyms and abbreviations are defined the first time   they appear."    Thus, a couple questions to answer:  1. is providing expansions for acronyms and abbreviations a level 1 or   level 2 success criterion?  2. the difference between the two success criterion is that at level 2 we   say "identify where they occur" while the level 1 says "defined the first   time they appear."  (There is an open issue related to the definition of   "first time" http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wcag20-issues#691)  3. Do we choose one checkpoint for this success criterion or are there   really separate criteria?  4. Is there overlap between the checkpoints that we need to address or is   this redundancy necessary?    Thanks,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--        

      I took an action item at the 14 February meeting to find out if a tool   could determine how many tracks were included in a Flash file by looking at   the file.  It does not appear to be so.  I created a movie with 2 layers   then looked at the file in wordpad.  All I can see is a bunch of "junk."    i named the objects I created, and that text is readable, but that's about   it.  I think we'll have to ask authors when we run into flash.    anyone else know otherwise?  --w  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Rather, my question is, "what is the accessibility rationale for this   technique."  I did not see any, thus did not include any in my proposal.    I think the rationale is "good design."  Regardless of whether I choose a   high-contrast background and foreground color combination (white and dark   red), if the user only selects a foreground color (white) current user   agents will not select a high contrast background color.  They will display   the author set background color (white) and the user set foreground color   (white).  The user will have to select a foreground color as well.  In some   browsers, the user could select "high-contrast mode" where the browser   selects both the foreground and background colors.  For example, yellow   text on a black background.    >Maybe we should ask the ER or UA groups to look in more detail at the issue  >of ensuring contrast? Most User Agents allow a choice of colours, although  >most do not automatically pick a contrasting colour where there is a conflict  >or semi-specified colour scheme.    I think this is a UA issue and have CC'ed the UA working group.  Chris   Ridpath recently published results of a color study, so I have CC'ed ER as   well.  Refer to the techniques for Checkpoint 2.2 in the 26 April 2000   working draft of AERT [1].    Since there do not appear to be any objections to my proposed edit of the   CSS techniques module, I will make the appropriate changes.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast      >On Thu, 8 Jun 2000, Wendy A Chisholm wrote:  >  >   I have two questions in relation to this issue:  >   1. will user agents automatically make adjustments for background or  >   foreground color if the author specifies a good combination but the user  >   only specifies one or the other (foreground or background but not  >   both)?

      hi,    I'm not sure if I was missing it..but I could not find a link to the ER   existing tools list.  Therefore, I added it under the heading, "Related   Documents."  This may not be the best choice, but there aren't many others   for this page <grin>.  I also updated the names of the guidelines of the   other groups.    --w        

      Eric,    I think your proposals clarify many points.    The definitions should be added to the Techniques document and possible the   errata page.    I like dropping the example at the end of 1.4, but I don't think we need to   add the note.  (From my limited knowledge of SMIL) it does not appear to be   possible to do it today and could be confusing.    I like your rewording of checkpoint 1.3 and am willing to adopt it in the   errata page.  However, I think that checkpoint 1.3 should remain a priority   1 because of the until user agents clause.  In today's world (where the   text of the auditory description can not be synthesized to speech on the   fly as well as synchronized with the primary audio track) 1.1 says to   provide text equivalents, and 1.4 says to synchronize all equivalents.  If   1.3 were not a P1 then that's all someone would have to do.  That's not   acceptable for today's world.    I would agree that in the next release we could put checkpoint 1.4 before 1.3.    I also have questions about your 3rd proposal:    >====  >3. Add a checkpoint (WCAG checkpoint 1.3A).  >  >The following revision makes clear that the even after user agents are able  >to produce synthesized-speech auditory descriptions from text, a  >prerecorded auditory description may still improve access. By having a  >distinct checkpoint for prerecorded auditory descriptions that does _not_  >have an "until user agents" clause, one can affirm the value of prerecorded  >auditory descriptions even _after_ they have been rendered partially  >obsolete by advances in user agent technology.     >8 text snipped 8<    >"1.3A Provide a prerecorded auditory description of the visual track of a  >multimedia presentation. [Priority 3]"    I assume the value of prerecorded auditory descriptions comes from the   inflections and nuances of a human reading the text.  It is my   understanding that advances in speech synthesis technology are creating   voices that sound much more "human."  With aural cascading style sheets I   also assume we can pick up more of the inflections, intonations, etc. of   human speech.  Therefore, I am not sure I agree with the need to create a   new checkpoint.  However, this is based on the assumptions that this   technology will be as good as promised.  This may be further in the future   than the life of the proposed checkpoint.    >===  >4. Fix the Techniques document.  >  >The Techniques should be modified to reflect the new emphasis. For example,  >ideally, the techniques could point to some approach or technology (e.g.,  >SMIL [?]) that could allow the captions, text transcript, and prerecorded  >auditory description to be generated automatically from the collated text  >transcript and its synchronization information.    The SMIL access note has several examples that we can refer people   to.  Note that it does appear that a collated text transcript can be used   to create both captions and an "on the fly" synthesized auditory   description with SMIL 1.0 markup.  However, since the next version is still   under discussion, I assume we'll be working with them on this.  The future   looks bright already, since a systemAudioDesc test attribute is already   described in SMIL-Boston. http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-boston/    >5.

I suggest that we just use "captions"   since one or the the other or both may be provided by an author.    --wendy    <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>        

      WCAG WG, I've included you on this thread since we are discussing issues   with tabindex.  Particularly, using tabindex=1 to skip over a navigation bar.    >CMN  >What you wrote was clear.

I modified Cynthia's test page to   play with this more [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/divs.html].  I had not   realized that Opera (4.0) does not seem to support tabindex at all (much   less on DIVs).    Note that I also included the link at the top to bypass the navigation   bar.  This works fine in MSIE, until one begins tabbing through the links   that do not have tabindex defined for them.  This does not work in   Opera.  Following the skipnav link, Opera will position the1st DIV at the   top of the page, but then pressing tab takes me back to the 1st navigation   bar link.  Therefore, I'm not sure what to do in Opera.  With MSIE it seems   that if you define tabindex for one link (or more than one link) you better   define them for all.  The thing is, you could define the 1st one as   tabindex=1, but the rest could all be tabindex=2 if you want to go through   them in order.    Note that on the test page, several of the items are tabindex=1.  This   behavior is consistent with the HTML 4 spec re: tabindex   [http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex].    --wendy      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      Hello,    A while back ER requested that GL discuss "null alt-text."  It was   discussed  t our 28 October telecon [1].    Our conclusions from that call are as follows:    1.  authors  shouldn't use " " since spaces are ignored by user agents.  2.   is just another form of white space and therefore should be   avoided because it should not be used for formatting. it should only used   to keep pieces of text together (e.g. in WCAG we keep the word "priority"   and the level together).  3. <A href="foo.html"> <img alt="" src=...> prices </A> is o.k.  4. <A href="foo.html"> <img alt="prices" ...><img alt="" src=...> </A> is   not o.k. an abuse of the image element.    Therefore, if the rest of the members of this working group agrees with   these conclusions we will send them on to ER as well as incorporate them   into the Techniques document.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/19991028.html        

        The current proposal is:  "Transcoding servers and intelligent user agents can be more flexible in  their presentation of content to the user. Benefits include such things as   letting  the user adjust whether they want to allow, block, or be asked how to handle  pop-ups; notifying the user when a page transition makes significant changes  to the page layout; identifying links that will pop up a new window or go to  a different site; etc."    How about "web services and user agents" or "web services and clients"  or   "web services and browsers" instead of "Transcoding servers and intelligent   user agents."    --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      oops, I gave the wrong URL.  try  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/charter-2000.html    to see the current collection of ideas to discuss in regards to   rechartering this group.    --wendy        

      Tim,    This weeks MSDN "DHTML Dude" [1] says,  <blockquote>  The Internet Explorer team frequently receives requests to allow users to   disable the appearance of pop-up windows. Yet this puts us in a dilemma: Do   we allow developers the freedom to use this potentially powerful tool to   offer great solutions to their customers? Or do we restrict the platform so   developers cannot misuse this functionality? The Internet Explorer team has   taken the stand that except where security concerns are present, we should   allow developers as much flexibility as possible to build powerful   applications, without undue restrictions.  </blockquote>    WCAG is relying on users being able to control windows opening and   closing.  This is covered by UAAG 5.3.  Does the IE team realize that UAAG   is talking about configurability of the user agent rather than restricting   what it is possible for developers to do?    In other words, pop-up windows can be very useful.  They can increase   usability if you are able to use them as intended.  However, they can   really muck things up if you can not use them as intended.  Therefore, we   don't want to restrict developers from using them, but we do want to let   people configure the use of pop-up windows.  For example, opera will let   you say "do not open windows in a new window."    So, can you tell us if the IE team is willing to consider this if it is   about user configurability rather than restricting developers?    Thank you.

      Hello everyone,  I have brought this issue to Judy's attention.  This is a W3C policy issue   and not something that the working group can decide. We can propose what we   think should happen but I'm not sure what the policy issues are with   keeping a local copy of a logo.  --wendy    At 05:37 PM 12/20/00 , Sean B.

LK and WC derive agenda from today's discussion    -- Participants  Len Kasday  Harvey Bingham  Chris Ridpath  Wendy Chisholm  William Loughborough  Michael Cooper  Regrets  Gregory Rosmaita  Status of ERT being public  WC I was out Thursday and Friday and have a few things to clean up. Will   make the request to the Web and Comm teams today to publish ERT as a public   working draft. Hopefully, it will then be public this week.    -- Agenda for f2f in Amsterdam  LK proposal:  Day 1  Welcome  Intro's  brief demos and discussions of aprompt, bobby, tablin, WAI reporting tool,   WAVE Discussion of ERT Issues  Day 2 (with Authoring tools group)  Status reports and discussions with other tool developers...  what tool developers to invite?  topics?  WL Amaya invited?  WC yes, but unable to make it. Woman from allaire is coming. Gerald   Oskoboiny. others. want to have strong  HB we have a set of tools we don't have a strength and weaknesses amongst   the tools that might help somebody. How do the tool contradict each other.   A cross-tool assessment. Make sure statements of the tools are up to date.  WL use the checklist to determine this.  HB help to have a pointer from developer to their results of the checklist.  WC what do people want out of the meeting? Chris, what can we  CR a-prompt we need more feedback. how reach agreement? how move on?  WL get our list included in as many commercial authoring tools as possible.   when someone uses an authoring tool is a way to get to these tools.  WC so you're saying "strategizing" - epsecially when AU group is present.  LK since a bunch of new people and those with development experience, would   like to push the envelope. we have tended to discuss things straightforward   strategies. i'd like to see us put in a serious effort on complicated   things. this should attract developers. include: schemas for describing   accessibility, pattern recognition or AI to sense what's going on on the   page, tool to deduce the headers  WL a "structuralizer"?  WC brainstorming sessions of more difficult items? allow ourselves to dream   a little bit?  WL we talked about including this type of thing in an Authoring Tool.  WC demonstration of tools? good way to get feedback? or do on our own time   before we arrive?  LK gives sense that something is real.  @@LK invite T.V. Raman to face2face.  MC demo be useful but keep it limited. review the landscape of features and   how that compares with ERT.  WL show excerpts of code.  LK really?  HB get lost in the detail?  WL pseudocode?  LK the tools look at attribute values. ERT is sort of pseudo-code. would   not want to see Java or Perl on official meeting time.  WC what about demoing after lunch? a break out session?  LK I like to see something concrete. discussion is more productive when   concrete things. take a bunch of tools, those that are represented or not,   show screen shots of each tool. there will be people who are not familiar   with the tools.  WC interaction stimulate the ideas.  LK range of tools - a fast way to get an overview. review of what tools out   there and demos. each demo should contain an overview.  MC want to do goal-setting. tool demos might interfere.  CR nice to see the tools but don't want to take up too much time.  WL show off in 10 minutes.  MC more of an appetite wetter.  WL a sales pitch in a sense.  WC 1 1/2 hours of demos.  /* discussion */  WC summary: Thursday: pound on ERT, Friday: strategize and demo.  MC need a structure for Thursday. need idea of what things to come out of   the meeting with. timeframes so we make sure to cover things. should set   goals for the group and how to achieve them.    -- Charter  WC have had not comments. not sure if I should push it forward. what do   people thing?  WL categories things in parantheses should be the first thing after number.   should be definition list. like to see testers include people doing this   for policy matters. a company will ask a tester to ensure pages conform or   person in purchasing department of U.S. govnt or hearing offiicer who has   to determine if a site is accessible under the law.  LK the way it is written, i think it is part of the organization who is   writing the web site. you are getting at external people.  WL some language that these people are "judges."  HB testers don't always carry the same weight.  LK "those who need to evaluate web sites: policy makers, management,   software testers, ..." people higher up on management tree.  WC mission statement?  The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:  to document techniques for creating Evaluation and Repair Tools;  to find tools that implement the techniques and where there are none,   implement them ourselves;  to provide a discussion forum to review and collaborate on tool development;  to assess the impact of evaluation and repair tools on the accessibility of   the Web.  LK #4 - evaluate the impact is new.  WC we have to be able to assess our impact. perhaps better to say how many   of our techniques are implemented.  WL but to tell whether our tools are in use is different than impact on the   accessibility of the web.  LK the wording would be: to evaluate the degree to which our tools are used.  WC techniques being implemented or tools being used by people?  LK availability of tools that include these features.  WC determining if techniques implemented is straightforward, but how many   people use, is that possible?  LK those that are online can track accessess.  WC what is the benefit of knowing that?  LK benefit to see the accessiblity of web change because of these   tools...we could have 1000 tools out there and every authoring tool   included but have people not make accessible web pages.  WL as long as we don't have to assess the impact that we have on the   accessibility of the web.  LK "to find tools that implement the techniques and where there are none,   implement them ourselves;" in the case of WAVE, A-prompt, and Bobby. We're   working in close collaboration, but they are not being developed by the group.  WL what do you mean by the group?  LK of the tools that are on our list, WAVE, A-prompt, and Bobby, which if   any can we say we have implemented ourselves.  HB only way to do that is to say those paid for by w3c.  WL was WAVE developed by group or by yourself? pride of authorship issue.  MC Bobby is CAST's tool but we implement guidelines by w3c. work with ER is   an extension. we are implementing an automatized version of that, although   w3c guidelines.  CR same for A-prompt.  WC "ensure that comes into being"?  CR promote?  LK I can envision a project where someone in the group is managing change   control system, a different person working on module A, someone else on   module B...a standard software development project.  WL vivid imagination. i think this is something where chris writes   something, then len writes something.  WC shares the vision. take Amaya. trying to get more developers on the list.  WL what about Amaya?  WC open source.  HB it is a testbed. it does not reach a level of commercial completeness.  WC that's why I also mentioned Mozilla.  HB limited participation. hard time imagining we'll have the clout.  WC "Where we can not find a tool that implements a technique from the ERT,   we will: Participate in developing open source software such as Amaya or   Mozilla, Develop a prototype to test that the technique is a sound   suggestion, Provide a forum for members of the list to discuss tools in   progress, such as A-Prompt, Bobby, WAVE, etc., Encourage developers of   commercial tools to participate in the developer forum."  WL sort of a description from LK and HB that had to do with how this stuff   is done when someone is manufacturing a software product or it's like   mozilla where people put in bits and they get accepted or not. i thought   you were organizing some such project.  LK 2nd bullet: "Develop a prototype to test that the technique is a sound   suggestion," that's us. that's where the group does something. This   certainly makes sense. If the group can develop a document we can develop code.  HB glad we have people willing to push code along. i raise the request that   we expect that we feed it back to AU and UA where it is not reasonable.  WL not clear on what "develop a prototype" does. don't see evidence that   this group could do that.  LK WAI has been delivering specifications. editors who are responsible for   overall development. other members criticize, give feedback, rewrite   pieces, submit proposals.. if use that model for software have 1 or more   people responsible for code to come out and others delivering modules. not   quite an open source framework. in other open source world, is it   centralized? or distributed?  WL read the Cathedral and the Bazaar. it is very distributed. the   centrality is a spot on the web. only a handful can change what is there.   like amaya - you can put stuff there but only included if someone says ok.   in the case of amaya - it's irene.  WC MC and CR??  CR agree with promotion, but not sure about implementation. not sure we   should own them. aren't we more about the ideas.  WC yes, and making sure that those ideas come into being. not sure what you   mean by "ownership?"  CR if implement ourselves then we own. if Len gave WAVE to the group then   the group becomes the gatekeeper.  LK right, like the ERT doesn't go out until the group has consensus.  CR can see that the group has tools. someone create something, "i can't   maintain anymore. give to the group." now the group has to maintain.  LK if we implement something ourselves it implies that we will support and   maintain.  WC that's why suggest "prototype in the deliverables." then in mission   statement: change "to find tools that implement the techniques and where   there are none, implement them ourselves;" where there are none, prototype   or participate in the development of an implementation.  MC purpose of prototype then is another way to stimulate tool developers to   implement the techniques in their tools.  LK practical aspects: let's say we implement a prototype and there is a   home page for that prototype. this would imply that the logo and home page   is at the w3c site. as i do something on their time, they want to have that   result is the logo "institute on disabilities."  WC don't think it would be a problem for it to be hosted elsewhere.   different from w3c technical report.  want to clarify that this proposal is ok, "where there are none, prototype   or participate in the development of an implementation."  MC more than demonstrating feasibility what the prototype does is think of   specifics that might not occur just working at high-level of ERT.   therefore, that's the main benefit.  LK other aspect, we could find out that something was not useful. even   though it seems like a good idea on paper.  MC we will find that when we work on the guidelines that we get to those in   ERT that we have not got into yet.  LK especially heuristics. a rating for a page for cognitive disabilities.   show results to experts. could find out that it does not apply. or get   false positives.  WL /* reads quote from Jason */ accessibility as an additive...  @@WC make changes to charter and publish for group review.

WAC selected issues on the   fly that were not related to conformance or specific checkpoints and that   we had not discussed for a while. We got through quite a few of them with   several people accepting action items.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html    Summary of resolutions and actions    - Action WAC and LGR discuss proposal for disclaimer for non-W3C techs.   Also, process. Chase up Judy's idea about W3C member submission. Review   section 8 of the Process document - Member Submission.    - Action MM, CS, WAC apply the techniques dtd to Core techniques, CSS and   server-side.    - Action WAC clean up issues list.    - Action Editors: Propose wording for color contrast checkpoint (use   existing 2.2 from WCAG 1.0) with some success criteria?    - Action LR: draft success criteria for contrast checkpoint.    - Action CS either find previously proposed checkpoint for switching   between multiple renderings or propose one.    - Action ASW: map WCAG 2.0 against IBM guidelines.    - Resolved: we want to keep ourselves up to date with other guidelines, but   not keep a mapping between WCAG and other guidelines up to date. We will   keep mapping of WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 up to date    - Action WAC: find someone to help keep internal list of other guidelines   so we can track other work in this area.    - Action WAC: while cleaning up issues list, issue #58 needs some digging.   Why did we get rid of this? Where did it go? Under navigation mechanisms?    - Action LR find out more about testing for flicker rate.        --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      hello,    sorry for the delay.  minutes are at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000724.html    24 July 2000 ER Telecon    Summary of action items and resolutions  Resolution: For all "until user agents" clauses we will create       techniques for user-side tool.  Action WC and CR: Investigate ECMA script and propose user-side tool       AERT technique for dealing with pop-ups windows.  Action WL: investigate what Lynx community is doing with scripting.  Action CR: Ask WCAG for clarification on checkpoint 1.3 - when do you       need to provide the auditory description and what exactly is     multimedia?    Participants  William  Len  Brian  Chris  Wendy    Regrets  Dick  Gregory    Agenda  grouping  multimedia  pop-ups    Pop-ups  LK You have a window that pops up as a result of a time out, random not  from user control.  The guidelines say, "do not cause pop-ups...w/out  notification."  WL One problem, is that the author can argue that the pop-up is a  notification.  BM But there are times when you don't expect it.  WL But they could argue that you would have a good enough idea.  LK Aside from what an author might say, the text of the window could say  something about what is going on.  WL An AT should be able to pick this up.  LK This checkpoint says "until user agents" so we're talking about right  now. Does it satisfy this guideline to say in the window "hello, i am a pop-up  window."  WC Yes, an explanation that you are in a new window is what is needed.  People get into new windows, wonder what happened, hit the back button and  can't figure out where they are.  LK Donations have gone up, can't ask people to remove.  WC Also, find out if still an until user agents clause.  LK CR what was the big question in your mind when you suggested putting  this on the agenda?  CR You suggested looking for "window.open"  LK WCAG suggests looking for in JavaScripts.  document.open is another way  of doing it.  WL Do we have a tool that analyzes scripts?  LK No one that I know is parsing scripts.  WL who is in charge of JavaSCript?  Can we ask them for the authoritative  way to write it?  HB My understanding is that ECMAScript is a snapshot of JavaScript from 4  years ago.  /* discussion of differences between JavaScript and Java */  WL Closest thing to an aciton item I can think of is to find out what  standardization is going on.  WC /* discussion about work on JavaScript */  WC want to know how many people use Lynx as their primary browser. How much  longer do we support browsers without scripts?  WL Charles and Chris do. Whole group of nerds and geeks.  WC Yes, I realize that many people do, but I want to know how many.  I  think it is an interesting question. Then they are probably parsing and  working with in some way.  LK Al Gilman keeps up on this.  WL  There are lots of people who are only concerned about finding the train  schedule.  WC /* explains why some of the tables got lower priority b/c of  transformation tools. */  LK we're hearing that we should focus more on end-user tools.  WL Particularly those that deal with scripts.  LK A repair tool could be written so that if a window pops up, say "this is  a new window."  For JavaScript you would have to modify the JavaScript to send  the pop-up window through a filter.  WC evaluation: repair: transformation:  section for each under each  technique where exists (not required)  LK need to be more explicit.  "user-oriented tool" "author..." pages could  transform with author, then author use in source.  WC hearing a couple action items: 1 investiate ECMA script, 2. proposal for  AERT for this technique  LK Put user-side info in AERT or a separate document?  WC Lots of redundancy between two documents. Not many user-side.  CR Put it in now, move later.  LK With the database version you could printout a copy that was  "author-oriented" or one that is "user-oriented."  How is the database verion  going?  WC Not started yet. Focusing on tool database.  CR Enough that if pop-up occurs notify user?  If anchor or AREA element say  "open up a new window."  If ask author if in document, then that's fine.  WC What is wherever there is an "until user agent" clause, in the AERT we  suggest a user-tool rather than ask the author to do something.  WL I like that.  LK me too.  WC What about educating the users?  WL That's an EO thing.  LK There are alot of techniques, not sure where to begin.  Therefore,  priorities would help me.  WC Before we had said that we would create a "smorgasbord."  LK But I don't want to spend time debating the priority since some of those  debates can take longer than it would to implement it. I've been working  based on needs of users.  CR Don't like putting any extra work on the users, but as long as we  restrict to "until user agents" clauses it's ok.  LK There are some repair techniques, such as provide al-text where we  suggest a corresponding text link, where we could say "do the same for the  user."  WC CR is your concern about the user needing to download multiple tools to  access a page?  CR Yes.  WC All of these techniques could be incorporated into a single tool - like  Silas' Gateway.  Resolution: For all "until user agents" clauses we will create techniques  for user-side tool.  Action WC and CR: Investigate ECMA script and propose user-side tool AERT  technique for dealing with pop-ups windows.  Action WL: investigate what Lynx community is doing with scripting.    Multimedia  CR 1.3. Multimedia track requires auditory description.  What is it and do  we have to ask the user to provide?  For example, a silent movie.  WL if you don't have synchronization, the person won't know when to laugh  or cry. There are hypothetical situations when it will happen.  WC What about asking for it when needed?  CR This is a P1. If it is an important movie. If no text description don't  need auditory description?  WC Question for WCAG. General rule: if important info presented visually,  need auditory description.  Action CR: Ask WCAG for clarification on checkpoint 1.3 - when do you need  to provide the auditory description and what exactly is multimedia?    $Date: 2000/07/28 14:54:54 $ Wendy Chisholm  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

The two likeliest possibilities:  1. 11-12 July in Edinburgh, Scotland (after ASSETS 2002 -   http://www.acm.org/sigcaph/assets02/)  2. October/November in the D.C., USA area, hosted by NIST and meeting in   conjunction with other W3C groups (possibly EO, ERT, QA, others?)    We took a poll to see who was available when.  Cost and time are factors   effecting people's decisions although there was some support for each.    We then began a discussion of checkpoint 3.5 that led into discussing   conformance.  Jason took an action to pull together the pieces of  a scheme   that we discussed today.    We learned about issues with screen reader pronunciation of Hebrew and Mouri.    No teleconference next Thursday/Friday (21/22 March) due to the F2F   meetings on 23/24 March.    Reminder: If you want to attend the meetings you must register.  I am only   sending phone information to people who register. Cut-off is tomorrow.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/03/f2f-agenda.html    Safe travels to all of you attending the F2F in person.

Suppose we can make Section 6   of http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/ "open issues" or should it be a separate   document?    --w      At 06:38 PM 5/11/01 , Sean B. Palmer wrote:  > > 5.

      John, Gian, and Lee accepted action items yesterday to review files for   conformance to checkpoint 1.1. (Thanks!!)    There are 10 test files for checkpoint 1.1 at (as well as files for several   other checkpoints)  http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/  (files with the name 1-1-1-f[1-10].html  e.g. http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/1-1-1-f1.html  http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/1-1-1-f2.html  through  http://snow.utoronto.ca/access/evaltoolreview/ATRtestfiles/1-1-1-f12.html    The files were created by Chris Ridpath and Josh Krieger to cause   evaluation tools to trigger specific warnings.    After going through them again, I think it would be more helpful to go   through the few mock sites that I'm aware of.  I expect that more mock   sites exist. If you are aware of one, please send me a link so we can   generate a list.    1. mock news site created by Matt May.  This site was created to purposefully violate several checkpoints.  http://bestkungfu.com/csun/    Many images do not have text equivalents.  What should the text equivalent   be?  Do you agree with the text equivalents that are provided?  What about   the flash animation - what text equivalent would you assign for that.    2. WebAIM's mock site - University of the Antarctic  Again, this site purposefully violates several checkpoints  http://www.webaim.org/tutorials/uofa/    What should the missing text equivalents be?  Do you agree with the text   equivalents that are provided?    3. W3C mock health news site created by Ian Jacobs.  It purposefully violates several checkpoints  http://www.w3.org/Talks/1999/0512-wai-www8-ij/bad/index.html    What should the missing text equivalents be?    Here is the "fixed" version. Do you agree with the fixes?  http://www.w3.org/Talks/1999/0512-wai-www8-ij/good/index.html    4. I am reluctant to select live sites without asking permission from the   site owner.  Does anyone wish to offer their own site for   review?  Particularly one that contains audio?    How can we make this exercise more helpful?  Suggestions encouraged!

DB what are the limits of the applicability of the WCAG?? where is the   difference between interface and content?  CS should be clear delineation between responsibilities between UA and WCAG.  GR operating system vs. user agent. where OS should follow OS standards.  JW boundaries not easy to draw.  DB trying to understand issues to generalize is to definition of content.  GV talk about content as to include UA have to coordinate with UA. don't   know if it will be in this version or next version. w/in 3 years you will   not be able to tell where UA ends and content begins.  JW common set of technologies that characterize the web and it is changing.   that gives rise to difficulties and to some degree allows delineation to   take place. what predictions can we make?  ASW what about priorities? will we prioritize guidelines or technology   specific checkpoints.  GV good question. in my 4 points...it may collapse once i flesh it   out...the first 2 were priority 1, the other 2 were 2 or 3 in our current   scheme. today, prioritize checkpoints. on any goal, have things that have   to be done versus those that make them easier. don't know if we can   prioritize on such a high level. people want to know "have to's" and   "shoulds" and want "have to's" to be clearly defined. General objective   (strategy) then the checkpoints (technology-specific).  ASW in the current exercise a P1 may have been generalized under a P2.  WC we were looking at generalizations rather than priorities.  JW deliberately set aside priority questions because not relevant until set   aside the requirements.  GR proposed process: define abstract guidelines, then before write   technology-specific techniques have checkpoints for that markup language,   and those would have priorities, then move into techniques for how to satisfy.  JW think there is a level between general principles and   technology-specific. CMN and I have had that in mind for a while.  GR possible on theoretical level, however worried about one extreme to the   other. my experience, the middle step (checkpoints that apply to specific   technologies) would make it more useful.  JW CMN made the point that technique module would be an application of the   checkpoint to a specific technology. therefore most people interact with   lowest level.  WC GR said he was defining a process, but it was a set of layers and we   really do need a process. we have at least 3 drafts on the table and need   to take them soon to users to see what they find useful.  JW Define who using and how.  WC basically saying a task analysis - the first step in design.  GR want to add to the list people who are coming to the page  WC yes, task analysis. not sure if this be bottom up design - start with   technology-specifics and generalize principles or start with principles and   work down.  JW I think there is quite a lot that is not technology-specific.  GR not opposed to that at all. we need to have intermediate level that is   being overlooked.  CS what do you see in it. WC's draft seems to be at that level, GV seems to   be at the higher level?  GR WC's is the high level, not the highest possible.  WC want to see an implementation plan. let's stop talking about it and do it!  DT there needs to be a general level that helps define where you put   things, even the specifics. In these areas these are the things we are   concerned about. Then you can say, "this is what we are dealing with" how   do you do them with the tools we are looking at.  JW GV's divisions under which you would provide more info.  WC IJ and I discussed this week, and IJ came up with 8 divisions.  @@WC check with IJ to get permission to publish his categories to the group.  GG we have been teaching these to people who are naive to accessibility   issues. we provide them with general principles, then get into more detail.  JW so we can take the drafts and see how can fill them in.  WC can not create the middle layer until we have the technology specifics.  JW we have SMIL, SVG, CSS, HTML, XML. what else do we need?  WC middle layer should be culled from these.  JW what priority should we be working on: 1. technique specific modules 2.   defining checkpoints under the guidelines 3. abstract out the general   principles from specifics. what needs to be done in each of them and what   needs to be done and how to work through them.  DT so, we need to look at the technologies and go from specific to general?   or go from both ends?  JW the group is fairly familiar with the technology modules that we have.   which technology specific areas to we need to work on. user interfaces?   forms? multimedia?  GV we have checkpoints above technology-specific level. we construct the   checkpoints to be general but we don't always have examples except beyond   the one they stem from. therefore, technology-specific checkpoints.  WC isn't that what we talked about at the face-to-face?  GR that's what i mentioned earlier.  CS add to that, cases where you are using DOM/scripting those checkpoints   might override HTML checkpoints.  GR right, if generated by database could get the ones that you need.  WC sounding like an evaluation and repair tool.  CS but could be a filter to go through the guidelines.  WC yes, you can define the algorithm that says if you use X and Y don't   worry about Z, but creating a tool that implements that algorithm to tell   you not to worry about Z is an ER thing.  JW let's start discussing merits of various approaches. through that   process perhaps we can work out some of the issues. i put forward a few   checkpoints as some suggestions. let's start discussing detailed   requirements using that as a guide. let's learn from the process and work   as the basis for a draft.  /* time check 3 minutes */  JW not enough time to discuss cognitive disabilities. although, we should   see how new drafts address.  WC people should look at Greg Gay's document that has begun to look at how   to move forward with WCAG 1.0 with cognitive issues.  JW next week: joint meeting with UA.  /* GV and DB give regrets for next week since will be at the WAI Steering   Committee Meeting in Boston */  WC have people signed off on the Requirements document? it needs to be   published as a public working draft.  JW send a note to the list to be sure.  @@JW send a note to the list asking if the Requirements document is o.k. to   go as a note. give people one week to review.    $Date: 2000/05/02 09:05:39 $ Wendy Chisholm      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      My conclusion, after reading all the messages in this thread, is to leave   2.4 as it was since we are giving user's control of how long they need to   interact with the content.  It is not feasible to say don't limit the time   at all.    Gregg, Adam included flicker in his proposal since it is in the current   WCAG draft under checkpoint 2.4.    in the 20 January 2001 draft it says, "2.4 Give users control over how long   they can spend reading or interacting with content.  Mechanisms that   required a timed response include:  automatic   refresh,  redirection,  flicker,  blinking  This can be satisfied by   providing an option to deactivate automatic updating, or to control the   rate at which it occurs. User agents may also offer control over this   effect. Note that flicker effects can cause seizures in people with   photoepilepsy.

      I took an action during today's telecon to summarize our discussion   of  WCAG 11.4 so that we could continue it on the list.    The minutes are available at [1].    WCAG checkpoint 11.4 reads:  <BLOCKQUOTE>  11.4 If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide   a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible,   has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as   the inaccessible (original) page. [Priority 1]  Techniques for checkpoint 11.4  Note. Content developers should only resort to alternative pages when other   solutions fail because alternative pages are generally updated less often   than "primary" pages. An out-of-date page may be as frustrating as one that   is inaccessible since, in both cases, the information presented on the   original page is unavailable. Automatically generating alternative pages   may lead to more frequent updates, but content developers must still be   careful to ensure that generated pages always make sense, and that users   are able to navigate a site by following links on primary pages,   alternative pages, or both. Before resorting to an alternative page,   reconsider the design of the original page; making it accessible is likely   to improve it for all users.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    "accessible page" is defined as:  <BLOCKQUOTE>  Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a disability.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    There were a number of issues:  1.  When does a person receive a message about providing an alternative   page?  Is it only after they have not satisfied all P1 checkpoints, or all   P1 and P2?  OR, do people start out by saying, "I want to reach X level of   conformance" and if they do not meet all of the checkpoints associated with   that level then they are given the alternative page option as a suggestion?    2.  What are some automatic checks that we can perform to determine if a   page as been identified as an alternative page is up to date?  if it is   truly an equivalent alternative page?  One suggestion is to check that all   of the links on the inaccessible page available on the alternative   page.  Others?    3. What action do we take if we identify/verify that an alternative page   exists?  Do we suggest that they eliminate it since we prefer they try to   make a single accessible page?  Do we analyze it to make sure it is   equivalent?    Some feel it is a red flag indicating a "cop-out" in some   sense. Depending on the situation, an alternative page (or set of   alternative pages) is reasonable.  The unfortunate example is when a   designer has created a whole site with Flash.  The only alternative that we   are aware of is a set of alternative pages.    4.  We also discussed using nested OBJECT elements (with text content as   the inner-most nest) depending on what type of object was being included.    thoughts?  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000124.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Action WL Go through Nielsen's site to dig up info on creating   groupings. esp. usability tests of certain kinds.  ?       Action HB E-mail the group references on style, writing, and grouping.  ?

Harvey Bingham  ?       William Loughborough  ?       Brian Methany  ?       Wendy Chisholm  Regrets  ?       Michael Cooper    Agenda  We've been talking about how long a block should be, but what is a block?   Lets discuss some more, starting with Michael's proposal (thanks Michael!)  How shall we track issues, including cross group issues? One possibility is   to use W3C's ETA system. There was a section set up for WAI ER Although we   haven't used it yet. Those of you who have tried it... please see what you   think. If you want to try it out you can add yourself as a contact (This   requires member access to w3c).    Blocks  HB A block is a container for other blocks. At the lower level it is a   paragraph, a list item, a frame?  WC This is for checkpoint Checkpoint 12.3 - Divide large blocks of   information into more manageable groups where natural and appropriate  WL "block" a chunk of HTML formed by an element that begins a new line.  WC BM's proposal number was 10.  WL Doesn't understand context.  BM the consensus seems closer to 5 or 7, for lists at least.  /* BM reads from WCAG "For example, in HTML, use OPTGROUP to group OPTION   elements inside a SELECT; group form controls with FIELDSET and LEGEND; use   nested lists where appropriate; use headings to structure documents, etc." */  HB Doesn't like the word "block" prefers "grouping." /* reads from thesaurus */  BM Beyond what say in WCAG, "all of these grouping mechanisms should be   used when appropriate and natural." Also mention tables, etc.  HB So, we're saying a group of 5-10 other things.  BM if you see more than 7 of something, you should trigger the check.  WC If you see more than 7 paragraphs?  BM Break up lines of text into paragraphs. When is a paragraph big enough?   If 1,000 words, definitely "big."  WL Most of the style rules have to do with ideas being in a paragraph.  WC If more than one idea per paragraph, either manual check or someday an   automatic check. Need research on the table before can make a decision.   I've been looking at interface design, someone look at style and grammar?  WL We supposedly ask for proper stylistic choices to be made. There are   methods for looking for that. We're going beyond that, navigation items,   that don't appear in prose. However, they use the same sorts of rules.  Action WL Go through Nielsen's site to dig up info on creating groupings.   esp. usability tests of certain kinds.  Action HB E-mail the group references on style, writing, and grouping.    Event tracking  WL I deal with each issue as it comes up, not keeping track. Therefore not   one to ask.  HB Move our old log into that system.  WC We aren't expecting that the tool will magically make issue tracking a   no brainer, we are hoping that it can be used by people like a bug tracking   system. When someone has an issue they will add it to the system. Len and I   would then keep track of its progress. We need to resolve issues. Many just   peeter out. We are currently only tracking issues with AERT, those are kept   within the AERT as @@'s or listed as open issues. We will have other issues   raised however and need to keep track of those. Since AERT is not on the   Recommendation track, I have not been as motivated to thoroughly track the   issues. Regardless, we do need to track issues and make sure they are   resolved. ETA has some good features for notifying people, and a format for   collecting info that could help us organize our issues. It's a database so   we can make queries. It helps us maintain and archive so we can avoid   recycling issues.    Notifying authors of caveats  WL What about the "until user agents" clause? Do we have a tool that says,   "there is a place where you can count on CSS2 being implemented."  WC It's not just when does browser X support something, it's when do users   begin using that browser. Users don't upgrade for many reasons.  WL do you read EO? From Carlos, "how do we have a tool that let's you know   what is not supported."  WC TopStyle and HomeSite do a good job of showing you what is or is not   supported in a variety of browsers and what is included in W3C specs and not.  WL The tool that i envision will warn you if what you've done will not work   in Netscape4, for example.  WC Where fit in AERT? Checkpoint 6.3 - Ensure that pages are usable when   scripts, applets, or other programmatic objects are turned off or not   supported and actually, perhaps need a new checkpoint to cover? 3.2 Create   documents that validate to published formal grammars. doesn't quite cover   it, b/c you could validate to a grammar but the support is not there. Need to  Action WC add to AERT a technique that notifies authors when something they   have done is not supported in a browser, ala the HomeSite/TopStyle method.

This draft is not based on consensus of the   working group nor has it gone through W3C process thus it in no way   supercedes the checkpoints in WCAG 1.0. This draft is based on the   discussions from the last two WCAG WG teleconferences held on 13 April and   20 April 2000.    Based on feedback about the application of WCAG 1.0 to emerging XML   applications and other Web trends the WCAG WG wants to investigate how more   generalized checkpoints might read. Therefore, this draft has been produced.    This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by   other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use W3C Working Drafts   as reference material or to cite them as other than "work in progress". A   list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be   found at http://www.w3.org/TR/.  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    we discussed the title of the document at today's teleconference.  The   following proposals were made:    * "Techniques for evaluation and repair of Web content"  * "Evaluation and Repair tool accessibility guidelines"    The first proposal does not address that we are focusing on accessibility   while the second implies that we are looking at the whole tool for   accessibility  like the authoring tool guidelines.    other proposals? thoughts?    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        IRC log: http://www.w3.org/2003/12/04-wai-wcag-irc.html    Review draft: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/11/18-f2f-review-draft.html    Present: Mat Mirabella, Michael Craddock, Doyle Burnett, Yvette Hoitink,   Wendy Chisholm, Mike Barta, Ben Caldwell, Loretta Guarino Reid, Jason   White, Matt May, Gregg Vanderheiden, Andi Snow-Weaver, Avi Arditti, Bengt   Farre, Roberto Scano, Kerstin Goldsmith    Regrets: Cynthia Shelly, David Donovan, Roberto Castaldo, Patrizia Bertini,   Maurizio Vittoria    Summary of action items:  1. action: editors add an example to the unicode guideline about hard to   read font. due to UAAG the UA could swap font.  2. action: wendy, loretta, mat, gregg, doyle work on visual contrast   guideline(s)      Topic 1: Guideline 1.6 in visual presentations, make it easy to distinguish   words and images.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/11/18-f2f-review-draft.html#visual-contrast    Several issues with this guideline and its success criteria  1. "easy" is subjective (although this is a guideline not success criterion   and thus does not have the same testability issues)  2. level 2 sc (proposed wording): when displaying text against a   background, provide a method to make the contrast between foreground and   background greater than ____ as measured by ____.  This success criterion   could be testable, if we can fill in the blanks.  3. Is "provide a method" needed in the success criterion? or leave it as   "...make the contrast between..." or "it must be possible for the viewer to   obtain contrast..."  4. "when displaying text against background" talking about text or raster   image of text?    The 4th point became the primary discussion in order to clarify the goal of   this Guideline and success criteria.  For example, if the user is able   to  select text (to create contrast via highlight mechanisms), does this   satisfy the guideline?  The user could then copy and paste the text into   another application to read it. Does selecting text get rid of the   background image?    Using selection is not what is intended, instead the user should be able to   change colors and/or turn off background images (in HTML).   In SVG, Flash   and PDF, what are the requirements?    Perhaps we say at level 3 - be readable (by default). level 2 - user can   make it readable.    This raises other questions such as:  1. Can an author do anything that would prevent author from turning   off  background image?  2. Do we assume UAAG is implemented and therefore can assume that the   ability to change settings is available?    WCAG 1.0 has "until user agents." in the past we've said, "user agents   should do X, but they don't so authors have to do y." at some point it   would be ideal to say "these are the author responsibilities (x,y,z) and   these are user agent responsibilities (a,b,c)."  Ideal to constrain author   responsibilities as much as possible to prevent us from getting lost in the   relationships. Even if this explanatory, it should be able to help us reach   decisions and help us show others how reached them.    Returning to the SVG/Flash discussion, there were several questions about   pulling the text from the markup/file format.  We need to do research in   this area.    Regardless, we want to describe how content should behave without knowing   what generated the content.  Thus, at level 2: material should either have   contrast or have a way to create that condition.    Discussing how it should behave, we wondered about:  1. What about dropcaps? frillwork makes it unreadable to person with low   vision.  We don't say anything about fonts being recognizable. i.e., i can   use wingdings and that's a font.  in svg i can have a word, change first   letter into something that is not easily recognizable as a character. it   can have background and other features. it can be ornate. illuminate it and   can create a font that is embedded (in svg) screen reader could read plain   text, but if look at it...change to readable font by user preference. so,   at core it is a letter. similar to embedded fonts in css. can apply to just   the first letter. it's still overwritable.  this is an issue for pdf. fonts   are drawings of characters. in pdf, critical to know what character a glyph   represents.    2.  Are we trying to address issue of background obscuring what is there or   how readable the default font is?    3. Do these need to be covered separately or in the same guideline? Do we   need to cover both of them? Have we already covered the issue in the "map   to unicode" guideline? if not readable, still map back to unicode. No, that   is for instances where it can not currenlty be mapped to unocide, but these   characters (although heavily illuminated) would be mappable. partly, user   agent issue. perhaps draw attn to fact that depend on ua guidelines.  once   represented in unicode and assuming it is valid, then css could handle it.    action: editors add an example to the unicode guideline, about hard to read   font, due to UAAG the UA could swap font.    Another interpretation of the current wording ("provide a mechanism") is   that an author would have to write a script to increase the contrast if it   isn't enough.  A UA-independant solutions might involve other inaccessible   techniques such as client side scripts.    This statement cause a discussion about the "content must work when   technologies not supported" checkpoint. what are the base technologies?  if   an author uses an inaccessible technology,  but the user should be able to   control contrast, then the author can conform to this guideline (i.e., if a   mechanism is provided, one could conform to this checkpoint) but if it is   not accessible, then fail that part of the guidelines. Do we want to make   sure that users can manipulate a browser to increase contrast or that   authors must provide mechanisms?    Since we opened up the discussion, we went back to the original intent of   the guideline: foreground content is distinguishable from background...for   visual default presentation. It was suggested that we change this back to   "make foreground content easily differentiable from background." But, this   doesn't seem to clarify the issue. Other issues:    1. make it possible use ua to distinguish foreground/background.  2. originally, w/out asst. tech and w/out ua it is easy to tell the   difference (started at level 2). today, talking about ua and non-ua.  3. guideline said default but sc said "mechanism"  4. if you have a formula to determine contrast, difficult to say if enough   contrast or not.  how many pixels does it take for something to not be   readable? don't think we can find a formula.    This has been a good discussion, but there are several issues to discuss.   To move forward, a group of folks will work on a proposal to discuss.  action: wendy, loretta, mat, gregg, doyle work on color contrast guideline(s)      Topic 2:  Guideline 1.7 In default auditory presentations, make it easy to   distinguish foreground speech and sounds from background sounds.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2003/11/18-f2f-review-draft.html#audio-contrast    History: this guideline and the previous used to be one guideline that was   generalized to talk about contrast.  It was separated because some believe   it easier to think about the different levels of success criteria if keep   audio and visual separate.  There is concern that by separating them we   have a guideline (1.7) that only has level 3 criteria.    Questions about the success criterion:  1. Is 20 dB of difference between loudest background noise and softest   foreground noise or at any given time?  proposal: "does not have background   sounds that are at least 20 dB...x% of the time" thus, could be a cymbal   crash (that would conflict with part of foreground) but could still be ok.  2. most auditory content is a single track, thus no way to control   foreground vs background noise. Thus, if you want to go beyond level 1, you   have to save this as multiple tracks? Or, does an author not have level 2   if have content that has lots of noise?  3. what about a text transcript as alternative?  was this a level 3 at one   time? what if audio is always captioned?    discussion about moving this to level 3, since if have a movie or other   audio content, make it impossible to conform to level 2? if there is a   transcript or captions and you have difficulty understanding what is said,   why is that not accessible? thus, it is nice to do this one (thus level 3),   if have captions or transcript then accessible. it's only the fact that   there are captions, that make it possible to move this to level 3.    for wording: audio content does not contain audio sounds or are at least 20   dB... except for occasional sound bursts...short sounds. have to clarify   "short" "background" and "short"    background and foreground may switch, depending on content. e.g., person   entering parliament. when person talking, trumpets are background. when   trumpets move to foreground, get turned up.    resolved: use the plain lang rewrite.  make it a level 3. explain why it is   3 and not 2.    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

The central questions seem to be:  1. Do general success criteria provide enough information to determine   conformance?  2. If not, is it possible to make them testable enough to determine   conformance?  3. If not, should we conclude that checklists must be normative?  4.

The mission statement now reads,  <blockquote>  The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:  to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if Web content   conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0,  to make it easier for Web content developers to repair Web content that   does not conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.    The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools,   developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement.    This work is part of the WAI Technical Activity. The original charter for   this group was approved June 1998.  This work continues the work of that   charter as well as pieces from the Evaluation and Repair Interest Group   charter.  The Interest Group no longer exists.  </blockquote>    > >to make it easier for Web content developers to repair inaccessible Web   > sites.  > >The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools,   > developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement.  >  >Hmm.

      Hello,    I have updated the draft ER WG charter based on:  1. ideas from the face2face meeting a couple weeks ago,  2. a renewed understanding of charters based on my experience with the R&D   IG charter <grin>.    The major changes are in the following sections:  - Mission Statement  - Scope and audience  - Success criteria  - Dependencies and Coordination with other groups - primarily the   dependency with AU is more explicit, although I am concerned I may have   made it too stringent.    Note that I had been pushing for us to be operating under this charter   before the face2face. I forgot to mention that we (the WAI domain) will be   renewing several charters at once and had decided to wait until after WWW9   and the AC meeting to finish them up.    The new draft charter is available at:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter-20000531.html    I look forward to your comments,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Future plans  LK /* reading mission */ history: there were 2 groups, an IG and WG.   nothing has really happend on WG list we've folded into one. "assemble?"  WC "assemble" vague b/c not sure how much development we do.  HB don't think we'll do a lot of development, but we can keep the existing   tools list up to date.  LK what does it mean for the group to develop tools. currently, table   linearizer by daniel, bobby by cast, etc. how do those fit into "develop."  WC like to develop a community of people that are developing tools, sharing   ideas, etc. not sure how to capture in mission statement.  WL depends on what "working on" means. "here's to fix" then the group is   working on.  WC to create a forum to devlopers to work together  BM "encourage cooperation"  LK cover case where several developers sharing ideas about features and   things, another level there would be intercooperation for info to be put in   DTD. at one point we had talked about a language (XML or RDF) to express   the output of an ER tool. don't need to write that into the charter.  WC so 2 levles: share ideas about features in own tools and all working   towards one idea.  LK instead of linking in a library, link in higher level info like RDF.   some sort of define communication among tools. an out put of the group is a   more formal type of specification rather than qualitative like what doing now.  WC yes, that's from modularization idea from old charter.  WL lots of types of tools, lots o audiences.  WC basic question: do we want to facilitate people in this group working on   Amaya.  HB only 4 people working on. driven by their interests. it won't get usage   coverage of commercial tools.  MC the point of amaya is to work out the glitches. that knowledge could be   redistributed to wider distribution.  HB yes, important purpose, but don't think we can expect them to shape what   they are doing to fit our desire.  WL the amaya list is attracting more talent who are contributing open   source. it's more like linux world. Amaya has a public place to post stuff.   the codemakers will include that if they see fit. the contributing user   group is enthusiastic. I think it may grow into more than just a testbed.   Software grown this way has achieved enormous success.  LK there are 4 full-time people who are focusing on this?  HB that's across all W3C interest? they are the hosting testbed to explore   w3c ideas.  WL yes, but Charles has put a lot of effort to make them aware.  LK how modular?  WL based on THOT engine. heavily modlarized. i highly recommend that you   all try it. Editing and browsing are very well integrated.  WC perhaps get mozilla folks involved in our group.  HB got response that Eric Krock interested in us working with them but did   not offer that someone would join a WAI group.  LK Another model: HTML and CSS Validator. doesn't matter if people use IE   or Amaya. things that are not tied to particular browser/editor. that could   also be amaya if it could incorporate intelligence from "out there."  WC like with Homesite.  LK yes there are tools that integrate Tidy into the tool.  HB what get returned in program be in an accessible form.  LK the earlier version easier to read output w/another program.  HB I wrote tools that would analyze the results from Bobby.  WC still not clear idea what changes need to make to mission statement.  LK currently, creating techniques. not a specification what tools should   do. standard output would be requirements for tools.  HB my concern about requirements for tools: tools that get used for certain   purposes.  LK requirements specifying tool output? define a format for tool output? or   XML and clear write-up.  WC don't want another document. want to create tools. people don't ask for   another document they ask for tools.  LK say that tool produces machine readable markup and we're done.  HB how identify "gaps"  WC more proactive - like the original ER IG charter - survey people. also,   need to implement ideas in ERT.  LK if create something, need a platform. leaning more towards Amaya.  WL yes download.  LK just a few of us have been talking about. general comments?  CR do we need a motherhood statement - this is intended to make Web   accessible to everyone.  WC yes, need impact in 2 sections, "mission statement" and "success   criteria." also, assess impact. e.g., Amaya will conform to AU by the end   of our charter.  HB Amaya set up as testbed, encumber a testbed with accessibility concern.   testbed is level 1 effort.  LK depends on the architecture. if we can go in and fix it. judy's concern   is that there are not enough keyboard shortucts. it's normally menu driven.   it's a module somewhere. easy to go in there. but if spaghetti-type thing.  WL it's the former. it just takes some doing.  WC keyboard is just a config file. very modular.  WL horizontal scroll bar didn't work for a while, could do easily but   didn't have resources.  WC don't need to wed ourselves to Amaya in charter, but would like to say   something about open source.  LK yes, also emacs W3.  WC TV Raman worked on that?  LK yes. that is open source browser.  WL one of the neat things, despite all of this high-level stuff is that   which is addressed by WAVE and a-prompt. fairly simple tools. if we could   get it past the point where it says, "welcome to image."  HB wendy still working on existing tools?  WC yes.  LK everyone welcome to contribute.  HB would like to see which ERT techniques a tool is addressing. it should   be in our charter to maintain and reacte to those tools. we could link to   more discussion if appropriate.  WC WART group works on whereas members of group work on a-prompt, bobby, etc.  HB Idea of consensus. is there consensus on WART?

I'm assuming it's per the CSS1 spec since that is more widely implemented   than CSS2.    Sorry for the cross-post.  Please provide a reference with your response.    WebReview only shows !important in the CSS1 chart and not the CSS2 list   (which  they warn is not complete).    Thanks,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

        I don't think the main WCAG 2.0 document should list a categorized list of   host and supporting technologies since it would not be an exhaustive list,   especially as new technologies emerge after publication of WCAG 2.0 as a   Recommendation.  Instead, we could define what we mean by host and   supporting technologies in the WCAG 2.0 glossary and provide more   detail  in techniques gateway.  Also, some technologies, like SVG, can be   used as either host or supporting.  --wendy    At 10:55 AM 12/22/2003, Sailesh Panchang wrote:  >GV wrote:  > > So there would be no CSS checklist.

Dick Brown    Agenda  Agenda sent 15 Sept 2000.    Update on WCAG  WC Debate as to who writes the easier to read versions, EO or WCAG.  LK Here in PA we say, "WCAG" rather than trying to interpret as the U.S.   Goverment did. Will WCAG WG resolve any of our issues at the F2F?  WC No, focus is on next draft.  LK What about the alt-text for spacer images? still unresolved.  WC No, it's not. Was resolved at 15 June 2000 WCAG WG telecon.  Action WC: update AERT and WCAG Techniques with null vs. space alt-text   issue that was resolved in WCAG WG telecon from 15 June 2000.  HB Expecting fallout from DIW workshop to affect WCAG?  WC Yes.  HB Likewise, will WCAG affect DIW?  WC Yes.  WC We're focusing on language.  LK What about scripts? Directly accessible scripts?  WL Anything in a script must itself be accessible. Imagine that what will   happen when we divide the Techniques document it may have a section on scripts.  LK Direct accessible applies to IE and Jaws which can handle scripts.  WC Yes.  WL We have to remember that the new WCAG will mostly be the old WCAG. Most   of what we are working on is at the level of wording at the top part and   how its organized. It will clearly contain the same guidelines and   checkpoints. The fundamental differences are in how you say what you are   talking about.  WC Right.    Open Issue: O2 Checking for longdesc  WC How do we check if image is "complex"? Don't ask for longdesc for icons,   logos, etc.,. (from open issues list).  LK Related question, when is alt-text too long? There are cases when don't   need longdesc b/c can use longer alt-text than usual.  WL Trying to figure out when to prompt for longdesc?  LK Yes.  WC What kinds of automatic checks can we do to prompt for it.  WL When you put an image in, should be able to put in longdesc as well.  LK Is it fair to say, as far as WCAG is concerned, he could put as much   alt-text in there as he wants.  WL Probably a violation within the tool, no more than 250 characters.  LK Length is up to author's judgement.  WC Right.  WL Do we have a feature built into a tool where someone can specifiy that   Bobby leaves out....I don't want to hear that I could put a "name" after   every "A."  MC It's tough in the evaluation tool context, tougher in repair tool.  WL My site is miniscule compared to others and I'm getting 2 pages worth of   report.  LK You just ask once, and you can scan over (eyes or ears). Perhaps we can   categorize false-positives. E.G, "here's some extra info." If grouped, the   author could skip as a group. Or something like A-prompt, where dialog   boxes pop up, the author could check something to avoid those.  WL There are a lot of those. Setting preferences by the person using the   tool seems to be very useful. Deciding the parameters of those settings is   more complicated. I would never like to reminded that I should put a title   or name at every anchor point. However, if I was building something where I   might leap in in various points I would want those.  WC What about longdesc?  WL It's the same kind of thing. 80% of people using browsers where not   using it anyway. I'll just make my alt better.  WC What about d-link then? It's the interim solution.  MC But the problem is that d-link is visible, many folks won't use. If we   could get longdesc, tool support would come quicker. It's less intrusive.  WL Yes, many would like to use longdesc. Disadvantage is that d-link is   visible.  WC Ways around that, to hide it by using style sheets or transparent images.  WL Works great for people who are blind, but not for me. What if I use   d-link to get more info on text?  WC Controversial. Not intended use.  LK What about title?  MC In IE title on most anything, when mouse over will pop-up.  LK How long does it stay up.  MC Not long.  WL I think it's possible to put an element there and open some text.  LK Could use DHTML. Back to longdesc. The overall question is, "do we want   to have something that automatically selects whether longdesc is checked   for?" Does it trigger on every image? Or, just say it one time, like in   Bobby. Or do you want to trigger on certain conditions.  WL Or choice to do one both or either.  MC If we have heuristics, "this might be bullet, or horizontal rule" are   candidates for not suggesting longdesc. Someone suggesting determining the   complexity of the image. i.e., lots of differentiation between pixels.  LK On the other hand, if the philosophy of longdesc is information that is   not essential that gives additional flavor...what if a whimsical page where   bullets are fruit or skull and cross bones? Then longdesc would be the   place to tell someone about it.  WL Longdesc enables different information for different audiences.  LK Is that longdesc or title.  WC I would really like a longdesc for charts, maps, etc. What can we do?   Image size?  WL Depends on author.  WC Can we look for patterns similar to what was done with identifying   patterns of bullets and horizontal rules.  WL Then what do with those?  WC We seem to have consensus that it is up to the author to decide which   checks to do, but if a large site people may want help identifying which   images might need a longdesc. It's up to the author to choose that check,   but could be helpful.  WL If you take Struck and White, but to build a program that does this type   of analysis, you end up with a lot of laughers. That's sort of what we're   up against.  LK There are things that would be nice, we can't figure out how to do. For   purposes of AERT, on the one hand we say, "this warning happens with all   images, but you can turn it off. As a research project it would be useful   to analyze images and patterns of images for longdesc."  WL Talk of R&D group.  LK they could grep our doc for "research project."  WC reads text from Technique 1.1.2. Then we just add toLK's suggestion for   research project.  LK Strike exception for bullets and horizontal rules.  WL Agree. That is part of the research project.  LK It's up to the reader to decide if they want the whimsy or not.  CR I think we should leave in bullets and horizonatl rules, but if you get   rid of no big deal.  WL On the blind lists that I read, some people would like to know the   details of the page. For example at the water cooler they won't understand   the jokes about the risque bullet that was used. It's not important to   survival but to inclusion.  WC Bullets/HR part of "inclusion" charts are survival. If author only   checking P1 then don't check for longdesc on bullets/HR. Add a note to this?  LK We have a value system, "essential information" vs "secondary." The page   itself may not be essential to survival in the first place. If it's nothing   but entertainment...I am uncomfortable creating a value system.  WC Yes, it sucks, but if we demand everything nothing will happen. Adding a   description for everything will take time. Ideally, everyone will do   everything, but that's not the case.  WL And you will be ridiculed.  LK If you can say in one place, "all of the bullets on this page are small   gargoyles." Or a page that gives a general description of the site. Also   cuts down on the tedium for the user.  WL Maybe need a longdesc of the style sheet.  MC Think of ABBR. Only put in once. A UA could create an offline set of   expanded acronyms in the document and present them every time you come to   them. You're saying if longdesc for a particular image source, it wouldn't   be required for it ever again.  LK Sounds like an extension of what I'm saying. An interesting point.  WL Could also be metadata.  WC We are getting into standardizing authoring practises which is more of a   WCAG thing.  LK Also, PF and HTML and metadata and UA.  WC We do seem to have agreement that we can edit the technique, as long as   we don't get into assigning priorities for bullets and horizontal rules. We   can put that off to the "research project."  LK Although, priorities for techniques is an interesting idea. Wonder if   applies across the document. P1 less heuristics, P2 more heuristics, P3 all   heuristics.  Open issue: priorities for techniques is an interesting idea. Wonder if   applies across the document. P1 less heuristics, P2 more heuristics, P3 all   heuristics.  Resolved: Add to Technique 1.1.2 a future possibility re: research project   to check image complexity. Move check for bullet and horizontal rule to the   research project.  Action CR: make this edit.    APPLET and OBJECT  WL OBJECT is still alive in XHTML 2. Had accidentally deleted.  HB They were hoping that textual description stuff would show up in SVG.  LK Since OBJECT way of including Non-w3c standards, they wanted to remove   possibility of including non-w3c stuff.  WL no. there's other ways to get that stuff in. The main argument was that   it had become too huge. Had too many attributes.  HB Object had that as the last of the alternatives, render as text.  LK APPLET still deprecated?  WC Then how include multimedia? Other option is EMBED but it is not part of   any HTML spec. So, what would you use for Flash, etc? I guess SVG would be   included with IMG?  MC I thought it wasn't being implemented.  WL No reason to drop.  LK Think in IE.  WC Possibly also communicator.  LK If innermost thing is text then backwards compatible.  MC I always put img with alt inside OBJECT.  WL So, what's the issue?  LK There were a couple of things here. If you have an object and it encloses  WC If the innermost thing is a static image and object is embedding the   image, then need text in the content.  MC For backwards compatibility I usually use IMG w/alt, but agree that if   image included w/alt-text then need the next in the content of OBJECT.  LK Saying that is preferable, WC?  WC Not preferable, possible.  LK If have applet, does it need alt?  MC CR and I discussed and concluded that we were confused which elements   allow content, which allowed alt. Decided to check for alt or internal   content and as long as had one or the other o.k.  Resolved: This is an open issue to be discussed next week.  Action MC: Find where in spec caused confusion.  Action MC and CR: send notes about this issue to the list.  Regrets from HB For next 4 weeks.    Other items  WL Anything to check http for refresh?  LK I have an action item to find out the situation.  Open issue: what are we going to do about http headers?    $Date: 2000/09/18 15:38:56 $ Wendy Chisholm      --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

        At yesterday's chat [1] we discussed the summary of issues sent last week [2].    >1. severity  >Not incorporated into the schema but used as an example extension.    Agreed this was a good approach.  [http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-15-13]    >2. repairInfo, expectedResult, suspectAgainst.  >Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    All agreed this should be handled by a generic "note" property.  [http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-14-37]    "message" fulfills the basic purpose, but perhaps a more generic name like   "note" is more appropriate?  <rdf:Property rdf:about="&earl;message"  rdfs:label="message">          <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&rdfs;Literal"/>          <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="&earl;TestResult"/>  </rdf:Property>      >3. operator, operatorInstructions, purpose.  >Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    was not discussed yesterday.    >4. testmode  >Had support and was included as a class, a property, and instances of the   >property.    Discussion about making testmode a property of the Assertor or the Assertion.  [http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T18-29-39]    1. If the assertor only has one mode (e.g., a one pass syntax validator may   only make automatic assertions), modifying each assertion with a mode   property is redundant.    2. We considered creating a "default mode" that would modify the assertor   and "mode" on the assertion that would override the default mode.  However,   there would be issues combining data if one set of assertions assumed a   default mode and another did not.  i.e., IF (assertor has a mode) THEN   (assertion inherits it UNLESS assertion overrides it) ELSE (assertion   SHOULD have its own)    3. assertedBy is already a property of assertion, so if mode modifies   assertor then mode could be derived from tracing back to the assertor   (through assertedBy).  However, this is an extra step that we are not sure   current tools would make.    We had a 2-to-1 split on how to resolve this.  The stronger position is to   only allow mode as a property of assertion because allowing it on assertor   requires an extra processing step that might not be handled by current tools.    We did not have a resolution on this.  I propose including this issue in   the Request for Review that will be sent to the various groups (listed below).    >5. TestCriteria,  suite, level, excludes.  OPEN ISSUE.  >This had some support but some felt it was going too far in the direction   >of a test point description language.    did not discuss.    >6. os, version. OPEN ISSUE.  >We agreed there is no unique way to identify a UA (i.e., URIs for each UA   >don't exist).  Thus, I still think these are needed to help uniquely   >identify UAs.    did not discuss.    >7. snapshot.  >Did not have support. Nothing added to the schema.    would be handled by the reprOf proposal (see issue #9).    >8. date.  TO DO.  >Agreed to use DC:date, but it's not explained in the spec nor is there any   >representation in the schema.    discussion begins at:  http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-48-02    I took an action to ask danbri or eric or someone and look at other schemas   to see how they import terms from other schema.    >9. Uniquely identifying pieces of content. OPEN ISSUE.  >The draft says nothing about how to handle changes to content identified   >by an xpath that changes and breaks the xpath.  I still think this is   >something that needs to handled separately (i.e., i don't think we want to   >propose a solution in the EARL 1.0 spec itself) I do think we need to   >raise awareness of the problem and pose possible solutions  >(e.g., 1. if a repair tool: add a unique id to each element you annotate,  >OR 2. use hashes to help determine what changed,  >OR 3. if interactive: ask the user to confirm that the element being   >referred to is correct, etc etc).    discussion begins at: http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-16-58    We had consensus to propose using reprOf  as a property to TestSubject that   can be used as a generic hook to  describe processing/derivation - e.g. an   XPath/XPointer, checksum, snapshot, line/column, set of HTTP headers, a   description of process and results including a snapshot, a webservice that   reproduces the processing,  points to the piece of source code that   provides the functionality in question (if TestSubject is software),   etc.  Thus, what goes into reprOf will be an extension.    Currently, the schema says:  <rdf:Property rdf:about="&earl;reprOf" rdfs:label="reprOf">    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&rdfs;Resource"/>  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="&earl;WebContent"/>    We propose changing it to:  <rdf:Property rdf:about="&earl;reprOf" rdfs:label="reprOf">  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="&earl;TestSubject"/>    Leaving the range open so that people can extend as needed.  Also, we would   include an explanation that describes a variety of possibilities for   extensions (ala the above examples).    >I would like to send a request for review to the RDFIG, the annotations   >list (www-annotation), and the QAWG.  Are  there other groups that we   >ought to send this to?    added to the list: web-ont, validator, and niq may forward on to some   usenet groups.  I plan to send a request for review by next week. I would   like to discuss the other open issues first.

      Kynn,    thanks for your comments.  My responses are interspersed and prefixed with WC::      >These comments are based on the 26 April 2000 draft of AERT  >(http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-AERT-20000426)  >  >To Do list:  >  >  1.  The term "author" is preferable here to "user" -- as with  >      the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, "author"  >      should refer to the person creating/preparing content for  >      the web, and "user" to the end user, even if the author  >      is a "user" of specific software.    WC:: I had an interesting discussion yesterday with someone who said that   "author" and "designer" imply very different things and both will be users   of the tools being developed.  therefore, i'm not sure that we want to   limit it to "author" but I also don't think it makes too much of a   difference as long as we are consistent and people know what we mean when   we use a chosen term.    >Introduction  >  >  1.  The specific purpose of this document is unclear to me; while  >      I understand what it does, I am unable to discern the exact  >      scope and goals of AERT.  The use of priorities (inherited  >      from WCAG) and of "absolute language" in many guidelines  >      make this sound as if it were a normative document, not a  >      list of suggestions.    WC:: I'm not sure what you mean by "absolute language."    What if we modify the second paragraph in the Introduction to read:  <blockquote>  This is an informative document that builds on the WCAG 1.0 foundation by   outlining techniques that evaluation and repair tools may use to uncover   accessibility problems and possibly repair them. These techniques may be   used by those who create web authoring tools or by anyone interested in   creating accessible Web documents.  Tools are not expected to conform to   the processes in this document.  This is not a definitive list of what an   evaluation and repair tool must perform.  It is expected that tools may be   developed that focus on one technique while others will try to implement   all of the techniques depending on the goals of the tool.  </blockquote>    Also, I propose that we cut the last paragraph of the introduction and   rework the 2nd to last paragraph to read:  <blockquote>  Many people creating content for the Web will not be familiar with the   various markup languages that are used. Many others will not know about Web   accessibility. Tools should be intuitive and easy to use and available at a   minimal cost. Tools should not generate excessive warnings or false   positive accessibility errors.  However, this document does not address how   to interact with the author. Please refer to the Authoring Tool   Accessibility Guidelines for information on dialog and interface techniques   for creating authoring tools.  </blockquote>    note that this assumes that we will take the "suggested language" sections   out of this document and synch them with the ATAG techniques as we   discussed at the face2face.  we have not completely reached consensus on   how or what to do. we need to start a thread on that.    >  2.  Is the goal to be a "collection of good things to do", a "list  >      of minimal functionality", a "comprehensive list of every  >      way to evaluate a web document" or something else?  The  >      answer will have a definite effect on the software tools  >      developed and how they use this document.  If this strives  >      to be a "definitive listing," for example, this could adversely  >      affect the ability of companies to produce commercial ERT  >      tools that have competitive advantages.    WC:: no, this is not a definitive listing.  this is informative.  it's a   collection of brainstorms for people to pick from.    >  3.  An explanation of this document relates to the Authoring  >      Tools Accessibility Guidelines and techniques would be  >      useful -- otherwise the possibility for confusion exists.    WC:: agreed. perhaps even more should be added to the paragraph i just   proposed.    >Structure of this Document  >  >  1.  The nature of the inherited checkpoint priorities needs to  >      be addressed -- is the listing of WCAG priorities meant to  >      be merely informative or are ERT tool creators expected to  >      follow those?    WC:: informative.  we have inherited the priorities from WCAG.  many tools   need to know what the priorities are as we expect that people will   implement P1 checks first.    again, there is no conforming to this document. it is informative.  i tried   to clarify that in my first proposal (at the beginning of this message).    >  2.  When a repair strategy is suggested, it should be made clear  >      that the options provided are not the only ones that could  >      be made available to an author -- and in all cases the author  >      should have the ability to override the tool at any point  >      in the process.    WC::those are ATAG issues (guidelines in fact) .  as just stated, i think   we will be moving the interface information to the ATAG techniques.    >Technique 1.1.1:  >  >  1.  NULL "alt" values (alt="") should be allowed.    WC:: this is an unending argument that i will not address here.      >  2.  The use of the term "suspicious" is, well, suspicious, or at  >      the very least could be avoided.  In English, this word has  >      a connotation of "deceit" and "guilt" that are not appropriate  >      for suggested messages or even for internal use.   A better  >      term should be selected, such as "Potential Accessibility  >      Problem" or "Requires Manual Check", which are value-neutral.    WC:: we are not suggesting that any of the text in the "Evaluation"   sections of each technique be used in the interface.  this is part of the   algorithm that a tool should implement.  if a suspicious pattern is   identified, then it should trigger an action within the tool.  this action   might be performed automatically by the tool or it may require the author   to do something.    I can see changing the text in the "suggested message" section, however I   think this section will be changing greatly or incorporated into ATAG   techniques.    >  3.  The suggested message for missing text equivalent should  >      explicitly mention the "alt" attribute, simply because many  >      web designers are likely to be familiar with the term.  >      Revised suggested message:  Missing text equivalent ("alt"  >      attribute) for image.  >  >  4.  Suggested text for "longdesc", however, will always need  >      further explanation, as this attribute is not familiar to  >      most web authors, and can lead to confusion easily -- for  >      example, many people will incorrectly guess that "longdesc"  >      is simply a longer text string, a la "alt", rather than  >      a URI reference.

I will respond to this rest of your suggestions later today.  thanks again   for the comments.  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Participants:  Sean Palmer, Charles McCathieNevile, Wendy Chisholm, Daniel Dardailler    Summary:  - Action WC try another stab at EARL abstract.  - Action DD send perl script for WART to list  - Action WC look for  Perl packages that generate RDF and MIME attachments.  - Action WC Talk with Ralph and Eric about saving/querying EARL with Annotea  - Action WC implementation plan for WART.  - Action SP Send DD a list of possible places to meet for ER/PF F2F in   Brighton (possibly end of 1st week of October or the week of the 15th of   October).      Detailed minutes...  EARL abstract and DIWG    CMN cross-over between transcoding an accessibility and CC/PP (this is what   I can deal with), and EARL (if you've got that type of profile, you   probably can't deal with this).  Useful approaches to the same problem.    CC/PP is about profiles, EARL is about conformance.    This collection of checkpoints means conformance to a CC/PP profile.    Then they want DAML-OIL stuff - our languages do the same stuff...    I don't see EARL having a major role in there    /* WC rereads WL's reaction to initial abstract notes */    CMN EARL is QA, if go down that road    SP Wrote XSLT to save EARL in a linear form so could include in a linear   data model.    CMN Why not put RDF in HTML?    SP No DTD for RDF, no way to validate.    Action WC try another stab at EARL abstract.    /* CMN gets DD on the phone to talk about WART */    WART    DD It's a perl script, series of CGI, that send an e-mail to the   archive.  There is a step where data is gathered and sends e-mail. Instead   could generate EARL report. I can send perl script to list.    Action DD send perl script for WART to list    WC Where is it?

        Hello all,    We've been asked to review the RDF Core last call working draft published   last week.  The last call period ends on the 21st February 2003.    RDF Primer (ed Frank Manola, Eric Miller)      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/  RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax (ed Graham Klyne, Jeremy Carroll)      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/  RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised) (ed Dave Beckett)      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar  RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema  RDF Semantics (ed Pat Hayes)      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/  RDF Test Cases (ed Jan Grant, Dave Beckett)      http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases    That's a lot of reading...    We ought to coordinate our review with the PFWG...I've set that in   motion.  I anticipate we'll have a chat in the near future to go through these.    More soon,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      At last week's meeting we determined that the note for checkpoint 10.2 was   incorrect for groups of controls, such as checkboxes.  therefore, I propose   the following text be added to the errata page:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Placement of labels for form controls.  Added: 18 November 1999  Type: Error  Refers to: Checkpoint 10.2 in WCAG 1.0  Description (and correction). The note for checkpoint 10.2  should be reworded to say, "A label for a text area, a text input control   or group of controls (e.g., a group of checkboxes) must  immediately precede its control (or group of controls) on the same line or   be in the line preceding the control (or group of controls).  Refer also to   checkpoint 12.4."  </BLOCKQUOTE>    It currently says, "The label must immediately precede its control on the   same line (allowing more than one control/label per line) or be in the line   preceding the control (with only one label and one control per line). Refer   also to checkpoint 12.4."  Which only applies to text areas and text boxes.    --w        

      Chris,    Here is my proposed rewrite of 1.1.2. Note that I also said that the   description or the need to provide one may be affected by the context in   which the image is used.    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Technique 1.1.2 [priority 1] Verify that valid IMG element descriptions   ("longdesc" attribute or d-link) are provided where necessary.  Evaluation:  Element: <IMG>  Requirements:  valid "longdesc" attribute (any valid URI) or a d-link required if   describing the image will add information not given in the text of the   page. The amount of information in the image and the context in which it is   used will determine how detailed the description should be.  Cases where a description is not required:  bullets - refer to Appendix J.  horizontal rules - refer to Appendix K.  Example of a message to be displayed:  If describing the image will add information not given in the text of the   page,  you need to provide a description of the image.  The amount of   information in the image and the context in which it is used will determine   how detailed the description should be.  Additional actions:  Ask user if the image presents information that is not included in the page   or in the text equivalent for the image. Allow the user to create or   associate a description.  with the  "longdesc" attribute on an IMG element  via a D-link  If another document on the same site uses the same image and has a   "longdesc", suggest that "longdesc" file.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    At 10:51 AM 2/25/00 , Chris Ridpath wrote:  >Wendy,  >  >We discussed:  >  > > >I thought the LONGDESC description should describe the image in relation  >to  > > >the document.

      Len commented that the content of NOFRAMES should be checked [1].  I also   realized that there was a minor technical error in the way the technique   was worded in the 21 december draft [2].    here is my proposal:  <blockquote>  Technique 6.5.1 [priority 2] Check that a NOFRAMES element exists within   each FRAMESET.  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  A valid NOFRAMES element should exist within each FRAMESET.  The contents of the NOFRAMEs element must allow the user access to the site.  Not allowed: Telling the user that they should upgrade to a browser that   supports frames is not allowed.  Suspicious words within the text a   NOFRAMES element: "upgrade," "full advantage," supports frames," "missing" etc.  Example of a message to be displayed:  Does your page work if frames are not loaded?  Repair Technique:  Allow user to construct a valid NOFRAMES.  Test Files and Discussion Files:  Link to test file for this technique.  </blockquote>    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Jan/0059.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-19991221.html    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

        IRC log at: http://www.w3.org/2003/12/03-wai-wcag-irc.html    Summary of action items:  ACTION: wendy find out if "work has ended" in 7.1.2 of W3C process document   means "stabilized" or "discontinued" - and how that applies to our use of   WG Notes to publish techniques   docs.  http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr.html#q71  ACTION: wendy follow-up on s. african contacts from tom  ACTION: tom work with lisa on editing rdf techs.  ACTION: chris will look into who is available for testing (at atrc)  ACTION: ben set up form to collect info about tools for testing (and gather   volunteers to test)    Next week's agenda:  RDF and CSS Techniques.  Invite Lisa and Tim to attend.    chris reports on latest work: the validator now runs several of the   checks.  has been looking at information about testing for color.    jenae has been reviewing the QA documents. we're probably most interested   in test guidelines. there are 7 documents. intro, operational guidelines,   specification guidelines, test guidelines.  depending on your role,   (editing) may want to read spec guidelines.  others may need to read all.   also have a "qa process document template" not clear if it is for every doc   or the working group.    wac gives summary of f2f meeting discussion w/karl and olivier (from qa wg   and ig).  Olivier will be the QA to WCAG liaison, the WCAG WG needs to   choose a WCAG to QA liaison (Kerstin expressed interest at the F2F   meeting).  Some of their documents are in Candidate Recommendation right   now, and we will be providing feedback and acting as an implementation test   for them.  Olivier will be reviewing our documents and working group   process through the QA lens.    tom still plans to write client use cases. then can say "this checkpoint"   or "this technique" is applicable to x, y, z use case. use cases: to   justify what we're doing. making sure that what we produce is helping clients.    Tom attended meetings of task forces 2 and 3 at the EuroAccessibility   mtg.  task force 2: producing atomic tests (similar to what Chris is doing)   - granular level, what constitutes compliance to wcag 1.0. task force 3:   developing a methodology to compare tools to the list produced by   tf2.  which tools complete which tests. tf2: alistair garrison is the   chair. would like to finish before the end of the year (at least for 1st   round). spent a couple of days talking about the 1st 5 checkpoints and   hammering out how to identify a text equivalent.  starting from scratch on   some of these. many members brought checks with them. took brief look at   chris' work.    Michael is meeting with Alistair on Thursday and will report next week   about that meeting.    There is concern that they are working off of WCAG 1.0 Techniques, which   are out of date. Also, concern that WCAG 1.0 has known errata and request   to publish an update.    How can we clarify how WCAG 2.0 techniques apply to WCAG 1.0 (both to ease   the transition from 1.0 to 2.0, as well as to keep 1.0 techniques   up-to-date)?  We have discussed a mapping in XML source to both WCAG 1.0   and WCAG 2.0.  even if we don't backport the documents, mention somehow   that more up-to-date techniqeus are available.  for people who aren't   following inner-workings of WG, the documents they will use are 1.0   techniques. there are some things that have been deprecated, put note in   1.0 document or completely update them?    there was agreement w/alistair's point about updating 1.0 documents.    even if finish wcag 2.0 by end of summer, becoming part of policy will take   a while. swiss law references "the latest guidelines from w3c."  italians   recently passed something, reference 1.0.  many governments are not likely   to do what swiss did, because of fear of instability.  it also doesn't   solve the problem, the latest is a rec and not our working drafts.    (according to the process document) it is possible to release a "revised   recommendation."  The issue is that it would take some of our attention   into that process, rather than WCAG 2.0 development.  There are also issues   with messaging and perception of instability.    there is some confusion about techniques documents remaining working drafts   or maturing to notes.  wendy clarifies of use of "note" in new process   document.  "note" is still a possible end-state, but it is now qualified   (working group note, interest group note, coordination group note as well   as member submission and team submission).  Before, all of these were   labeled "note" and thus all carried the same weight.  Now, "working group   note" indicates consensus by a working group while "team submission" is   something written by a W3C team member.  The only use of "note" that will   end is the unqualified use of the label.    action: wendy find out if "work has ended" in 7.1.2 means "stabilized" or   "discontinued" - and how that applies to our use of WG Notes to publish   techniques docs.    lisa - would like some help with rdf techniques. lisa looking for review.   try to get charles involved (at least review).  http://www.ubaccess.com/rdf.html  action: tom work with lisa on editing rdf techs.    Tim joined a couple weeks ago saying he's been allocated time from NIST  Just did a review of old CSS techniques    ===  gateway techniques    tom has bunch of stuff to put into the doc.    recent list discussion about scripts. what part of the discussion goes into   script techniques and which into  gateway? what about svg? e.g., how do   screen readers handle disabled forms? if svg or html require scripting to   enable parts of the page, it is going to be inaccessible.    This relates to the question of whether script being enabled is mandatory   for accessibility. WCAG 1 requires page function if script not supported,   does/should WCAG 2?    css and scripting, always used w/other technologies, thus should we produce   self-standing techs docs or chapters w/in other techs? support of script an   accessibility issue? how essential is the function?    determine if it is easiest to say "all these things are inaccessible, rest   fine." or "these are the only things can do, all else bad"    need to tease out which get handled in script techs and which in gateway.  e.g., gateway: script supported by user agent, general info, e.g.,   "roll-over scripts tend to be ok, if you use disable attributes..."  script techs: the script code that enables form controls, dynamic menus,   and specific dos and don'ts    when we refer to script techs we are talking about ECMAScript (rather than   vbscript or others)    proposal: if use script to enable parts of a page, make sure that is not   disabled by default. e.g., print icon. script generates it, only activated   by script. if don't have script, don't get it.  only people who see it have   javascript on, thus don't run into issue of having a button that is   unusable if scripts aren't running.    the script doesn't provide essential function, thus an elegant solution.  what about web applications? if no script support, can't use.  e.g., web   app (windows app ported to html)    if you need that rich function, will you need to find server-side   solution?  discussion that for validation, ought to have server-side   backup, but what about interaction?  Should there be the capability of   falling back to less rich but still nominally accessible functionality?    Example of web app that relies on scripts is the tree view of a file   system. An approach to the tree control is that it's done as nested lists,   using CSS to format as tree and Javascript to provide the functionality.   The fallback is that there are regular links that do the annoying refresh   or whatever, but it still works    concern about legacy systems and how difficult it can be to change.    What about browsers where scripts don't function? how do we address that   today? in 1.0, proper decision to say sites must work w/out scripts. what   do today? have to do the research. how many people using browsers that dn't   support scripting? unattainable data? logs know in theory if browser   supports, but what about peple who have disabled it? there is a way to   test, but people would have to hit a specific site.    tom will have some people who can test browsers and asst. techs. suggestion   to add a component to the techniques product to keep track of tests that   need to be done?    action: chris will look into who is available for testing (at atrc)    need a list of user agent and asst tech combos that support techniques?   when test for assitive technology and browser, there is a large number of   combinations, versions, platforms, etc. do we have a core list of user   agents that we want to be sure that each technique work with? i.e., for it   to be included, a technique must work with x,y,z browser and/or assistive   technology and user agent combination. do we need a lowest common   denominator to test with? come up with a list of software and hardware that   people (in the WCAG WG) have and can use for testing? Information we would   need about each product: name, version, platform, manufacturer, hardware   configuration (braille/audio, laptop/desktop, sound card, system, os, etc.)  interesting to see what list of tools we come up with. concern that the   only tools we'll come up with (at this time) will be english-based. will   need to find other testers. we met some potential testers while in japan -   possibly a way to get people involved and bridge communication.    action: ben set up form to collect info about tools for testing (and gather   volunteers to test)    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--

      hello,    in the Evaluation and Repair Tools working group we have been discussing   how to evaluate and repair tables.  Particularly, nested tables.    if nested tables are used to present data, is there a way to associate the   cells in the inner table with header cells in the outer table?  I would   assume that axis and headers could work  across tables (if a UA was built   that way).  However, in HTML 4.0 the only values for "scope" are row, col,   rowgroup, and colgroup.  so, it seems that "scope" could *not* be an inner   table.    Nested tables seem less of a problem for layout tables. I propose that the   evaluation and repair is to handle each table separately, like Mark Novak's   HelpDB tool.    --wendy  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>        

      The need for the language was not only to report the results of evaluations   but the results of repairs.  Therefore to report:  - repairs that have been performed as well as those that have not yet been   performed  - results of evaluations they have manually performed on the content as   well as results of automatic tests.    Therefore, "reporting of repairs" whether they exist in the past or   future.  We "report" info on both evaluations and repairs.  Or perhaps just   "reporting language." :) Regardless, I think changing the name to   "Evaluation and Reporting Language" would be fine.  Reporting is a good   general concept.    --wendy    At 04:42 PM 4/24/01 , Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >I agree with Daniel.

Jason White    Agenda  Posted 12 December 2000 by Jason White    Summary of W3C Team Project Review  WC Summarizes topics covered.  GV Those that issues that we found sticky, they also found sticky and   interesting. Our work is different in that most of W3C work specifies a   technology while we describe uses. In the end, the consensus was that we   don't want to ignore them but not sure the best way to handle them.   Afterwards, in discussion with WC, perhaps we publish a technology-specific   that addresses both where accessible and where not accessible.  KHS Reasonable, people use technologies other than W3C every day.  GV Don't want to be in a position where we only list the checkpoints that   are accessible and then people assume can meet rest. Want to make clear   where they don't meet certain checkpoints.  LK Is conformance something we'll be discussing. Will I be able to go to   the guidelines/techniques and come up with conformance claims or will   everyone have to come up with own criteria.  WC Not addressed yet so much. Will be soon.  LK Different browser capabilities not yet addressed in new draft.  GV What issue did we not get to?  WC CR exit criteria.  WL How affect CSS?  WC SVG good example.    3.1 Errata  WC Reads proposal for 3.1  CS OK.  WL OK, but would prefer #3 as #1.  LK Would like to see us apply this to specific sites.  GV Our site fails this. There are affects that we can't achieve w/CSS.  CS Then have an out with #2.  GV In a way an out with "when appropriate and support." But, says "avoid"   which means absolutely not.  LK General issue, it would give someone an out. I would add that the effect   has to be necessary.  GV I would question that. If there is a text-equivalent (this a P2 by the   way), then it is not a problem for people who are blind. The scalability is   achieve with browsers like Opera that can magnify the alt-text.  WC Alt-text in opera is magnified as well as attempts at image.  LK We have "Temple-Helvetica" and therefore I can use text in images   wherever I want. How do we prevent that?  GV Is it creating a serious problem for accessibility? If I do page as   Helvetica, then they have one huge alt-text. If the text is there and can   be scaled.  CS Add-in for IE that scales image.  LK If we take that approach, why have the guideline at all? There is a   difference in Temple Helvetica (which is not much different than Helvetica)   vs. a serious affect.  GV Because promotes markup.  LK Could we get this concern into compliance, as in "if you really have to   do this."  CS People will draw that line in different places.  WC This is an errata for WCAG 1.0, LK can you take an action to propose   something for WCAG 2.0?  Action LK: Propose language for WCAG 2.0 that addresses "if you have to do   this."  GV What about avoid where possible?  LK I think that will work.  CS Ok with that. Sounds like what I thought it meant anyway.  Resolved: Adopt proposal as errata for WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 3.1 with the   following change: Avoid where possible using raster-based images to   represent text -- use text and style sheets.  Resolved: Clean up "magnification" per Al's e-mail  WC Here's a wrench, what about Anne's suggestion? I would feel it passes   since it is graphical.  /* discussion about possibilities for arrow images and text */  GV You will either tell people to look at our examples and make their pages   look like that but always interpretations. In law, we use case law. We   would have a registry. We can incorporate into techniques document.   Therefore, we need "alt-text case law." A group will get together and make   judgement. People can look and say, "that's not what I would have guessed,   but ok. it's there I understand it."  Action LK: Create a page of examples to test this resolution.  GV Yes. Document discussion.  WC Ties back into ideas of candidate recommendation. Is a process to use as   move forward.  WL And second agenda item.    Techniques database  GV When we talk about database, I think of where you look stuff up versus   wandering through it.  WC But documents could be generated and pull from that database.  WL We're going to collect data, good and bad for each checkpoints.  WC The variety of examples is interesting: including databases, whole   sites, pieces of sits. Another issue from this a.m.  CS Copyright issues?  KHS May have to copy the site.  CS Examples that don't comply may be hard.  GV May have to copy onto our site - can't assume won't change. Another is   to copy on the site then change the content.  WC UIE used Disney site to show poor usability, but compared to new site is   much better.  LK Agree with approach. You can quote something for critical purposes, but   don't recommend it.  Resolved: techniques database, examples of poor and good is key to help   people determine conformance.  WC Who wants to help design it?  LK How should I start w/my examples?  WL Each a field in the database?  LK All in one page.    $Date: 2000/12/14 22:58:48 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

This warning must always be offered.  See issue above   >about turning off the warning when the author has fixed it.    WC:: we discussed this at the 31 january meeting. I propose rewording it as   follows:  <blockquote>  Evaluation:FRAME elements should have a valid "longdesc" attribute if the   value of the  FRAME "title" attribute does not completely describe the   frame content.  Refer to techniques for checkpoint 12.1  If a FRAMESET has three or more frames and does not have a "longdesc"   attribute, ask the user if the relationships between frames are not   apparent in the titles for each frame.  Valid "longdesc" file name:  Must not be NULL  Must be a valid URI  Example of a message to be displayed:  Missing "longdesc": Missing 'long description' file for this frame.  Invalid "longdesc" file name: Invalid 'long description' file name for this   frame: [current "longdesc" file name] - [can not be empty].  Repair Technique:  If the relationships betweeen frames are not obvious then ask that they   provide a description of the relationships. Allow the user to create a   "longdesc" file or associate an existing "longdesc" file. It is suggested   that each FRAME in the FRAMESET reference the same "londesc" as the   description of the relationships should be available from each FRAME.  </blockquote>        >|     * If FRAME does not have a LONGDESC attribute, ask user if frame  >|       contents are complex and requires one.  >|  >|  Valid LONGDESC file name:  >|  >|     * Must not be NULL  >|     * Must be a valid URI  >LRK:: The tool should then check the file that is pointed to.  >|    WC:: check it for what?    >  >  >  ==================  >|  Technique 1.1.H [priority 1] Check AREA elements for ALT text  >|  >|  Discussion Status:  >|  >|     * awaiting discussion  >|  >|  Evaluation:  >|  >|     * AREA elements must have a valid ALT attribute.  >LRK:: refer to above discussion of ALT text in 1.1.E  >|    WC:: not sure I would refer to 1.1.E, but it does look incomplete.

In this case, why don't we use the audio   >description needed for generating timecodes instead of trying to create it   >again automatically from text?    the text equivalent that is being read aloud should have timecodes.  The   timecodes are calculated for playing the text as audio embedded in between   the other audio tracks.    you say it does not save the author time - is that because they have to   generate the time codes?  With something like MagPie, it would be easy to   create timecodes - even if the author just creates a timecode where he/she   wants it in MagPie then copies and pastes that to anther file where needed.    If the author has to record the text themselves (in a separate audio track)   we at least save them that effort.  They will have to create the timecodes   whether they synchronize a text track for speech synthesis or synchronize a   prerecorded audio track.    Part of the assumption (for the future scenario) is that the author can   pause the primary audio and video tracks while the video description   (whether prerecorded or synthesized speech) is read.    Using synthesized speech is kind of like "separating content from   presentation."  Kind of like suggesting that authors use text and style   sheets instead of text in images since a user can change the speed, voice,   pitch, etc. of the speech to suit their needs.    Hopefully, this would also facilitate translation of the descriptions into   other languages as the automatic translators evolve (like the altavista   translator http://babelfish.altavista.com/).  If the text is synchronized   and goes through a translator before being spoken - we've now got   descriptions (and why not do the captions also!?) in any language that   babelfish-like tools are capable of processing.    --wendy  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>

Please let me know of any changes, questions or misrepresentations.    --wendy      WAI Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group  WAI AU Teleconference - 6 June 2000 (Joint meeting with ER WG)  Details  Date: Tuesday 6 June 2000  Time: 2:30pm - 4:00pm Boston time (1830Z - 2000Z)  Phone number: Tobin Bridge, +1 (617) 252 7000    Agenda  The Latest Draft is the Recommendation dated 3 February, available at   http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203. The latest techniques draft   is dated 4 May March, available at   http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WD-ATAG10-TECHS-20000504. The latest draft of the   Accessibiltiy Evaluation and Repair Techniques is dated 15 March at   http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert-20000315  Review outstanding action items  Integration of AERT and ATAG techniques  Tracking tools and extensions  Evaluation of tools  Other business    Attendance  Jutta Treviranus  Chris Ridpath  Wendy Chisholm  Colin Birge (Microsoft)  Harvey Bingham  Michael Cooper  Gregory Rosmaita  William Loughborough  Charles McCathieNevile  Heather Swayne  Phill Jenkins  Dick Brown  Regrets    Action Items and Resolutions  Resolved: AU will review and contribute to AERT as applies to AU.  CMN and WC pursue database technology.  WC take idea of other types of evaluation tools for ER. What exactly do we   mean by evaluation? Does it inlcude evaluation of tools or limited to   evaluation of content?  Resolved: We will meet consistently on Tuesdays rather than switching   between Mondays (ER time) and Tuesdays (AU time).  Resolved: Next joint meeting 11 July, same time same place. Next ER at   regularly scheduled time (next Monday). Next AU at regularly scheduled time   (next Tuesday).    Minutes  Integration of AERT and ATAG-techs  JT We need to discuss how it is easiest to integrate the two documents. How   do we distribute the workload? Are there common format structures to apply   to both?  WC Did not resolve how to integrate but that ATAG has interface stuff, AERT   also has example language. One possibility discussed but not resolved was   to move example language from AERT to ATAG-techs. Others recollection?  CR That'show I remember it as well.  JT ATAG has a checkpoint that points to AERT.  HB not more than one source for this material. Perhaps details are in one   document that are pointed to by both documents.  CMN A database format to generate the two documents. For ATAG we're   generating techniques for a variety of tools. That approach in general   would work well for us. Currently AERT is building this document and AU is   not. We're here to discuss how we (AU) can provide input to AERT. Should we   push off things like messages to the AU document. That would come back kind   of funny. AU has techniques that are general. We aim to have real live   examples, such as Bobby or Word, so that instead of providing abstract   messages we provide real-live examples. Demonstrate them as examples of how   it works in real life.  JT We all agree that we do not want to redundantly do the work. Arguments   for the same text in both documents so that all the info that you need is   in one document and because of ordering in the difference contexts.  GR The biggest point from the face2face was communication and collaboration   between groups. One advantage that AU has over ER is developer input. This   will help ensure that AERT algorithms are not developed in a vacuum.  HB ATAG-TECHS are primarily references to Amaya.  CMN That's the starting point.  JT Are you looking at the latest working draft?  HB From February.  JT Intention is to go beyond Amaya and to use samples of working code.  WL In terms of text from AERT appearing in ATAG-TECHS, we could use   inline-hypertext.  CMN The approach at the moment is to point to AERT from ATAG-TECHS. One   reason to look at other ways (generating multiple views), is that a   developer could get a view of the ATAG that meets the needs of the   developer (based on what type of took they are developing).  JT ATAG-TECHS wants to point to AERT and potentially flesh it out. Do we   simply link to it? Put it in a database that we can both reference? From   the ER perspective, how could AU WG contribute to AERT in a useful way?  WC AERT algorithms and ATAG are interface. perhaps the "example language"   is not needed.  WL is the only use of AERT for evaluation?  CMN The AU developers coming from ATAG are a subset of AERT.  GR If we expect tools to do some things automatically, the authoring tool   needs to do eval and repair on the fly.  JT Common set of techniques authored by ER WG that are applicable to ATAG   Guideline 4. WC talk about the interface?  WC ATAG interface  CMN so you point to ATAG for interface stuff (interacting with the author),   we point to AERT for the nuts and bolts for checking.  JT What do you think about CMN proposal for database.  CMN how is AERT generated?  WC scripts. Len and I have talked about using the schema and transforms   that was developed by XML schema group.  CR AERT as database or document?  JT Goal for AU is to generate not just 2 documents, but various views. If   in a database and modular chunks we can produce those views.  CMN Wendy and I will have to work together. The tools will be useful by all   of the WAI guidelines groups. The goal is to produce multiple views.  JT Do you see that as a valuable thing for ER?  DB yes good idea.  HB agrees.  CR agrees.  /* everyone seems to agree */  CMN an organic process. How do we contribute to AERT? Where appropriate   take part in the discussions?  CR We could use people to take a look at the document.  WC The link to developers and feedback is key.  @@Resolved: AU will review and contribute to AERT as applies to AU.  CR We're looking to get out a new version in the next few weeks and then   another in a few months. Should we stick to that schedule?  /* yes */  WL Designing new ideas doesn't preclude releasing documents.  Tracking tools and extensions  WC ER has a list of tools. AU has a list of tools. Very related. Let's   combine. People could search for tools based on a variety of attributes of   the tool: meets AERT automatic checks, conforms to Level A of ATAG, etc.  CMN RPMFind also uses metadata (RDF) and that's how we could store and   search through metadata. WCAG has an RDF scheme for conformance. That info   could be included as well. Then we could use that info in various places on   the web.  WL a framework for working with resources.  JT making some of it sound automatic.  CMN bits that are not automatic: Rpm2html needs some modification to   provide for our needs. Assessment of tools doesn't happen by magic -   someone needs to collect a library of tools.  JT it would be a consumer tool? Help them find a tool for their needs?  CMN yep.  GR people are looking to us to do that. I get lots of message per week   about what is the most accessible tool for someone who is blind or low   vision. People are looking to us to provide information for personal decisions.  CMN WAI gets asked for that info. AU would like to say "this is the state   of implementation in regards to ATAG."  WC Keeping it up to date long term....?  JT One strategy is to update objective information.  WC We discussed this in ER. Our ideal is for each release of a product, a   manufacturer would use a web form to update the database.  GR we need to coordinate this with EO. What ER and AU needs to do is look   at the requirements doc for WCAG 2.0. Particularly, audiences. We are   addressing similar groups. It's not just developers, but purchasers, and a   slew of others.  CMN PJ pointed out a while ago, that one of the most useful things to know   about a review is "who did it."  PJ Also good to know if the product that's available or one they are   working on. Internally track info like: Person, date, level. then   "yes/no/planned". Of evaluations. There are debates about what constitutes   Yes or No.  JT The questions need to be objective. One way around is to have them show   an example within the evaluation. It does not leave an ambiguous yes.  CMN Examples will help developers figure out how to answer questions.  WC Needs to be as painless as possible.  CMN It is generally in the developers interest to claim that their tool is   accessible. By thinking through it will help them think about it.  WC No doubt that it's a good exercise. But if people have to spend time to   substantiate their claim, they won't do it.  JT It becomes a marketing tool. People will take the time.  CMN What do developers have to say. It's not from a lack of good will   mostly a lack of how to interpret something if there are not examples.  JT We're talking about a database of tools and making it easy to find out   info about the tools.  DB Is that a certification?  CMN We need to be clear that these are somebody's assessment and we don't   provide guarantees.  JT The more we limit it (through examples) the less we have to assert it's   someone's opinions. We may have a developer who evaluates their own   product, we could then have someone else evaluate it.  WC Interesting issues with certification and marketing that we need to be   aware of.  GR Whenever a WG member performs an evaluation, they need to give the   developer a chance to respond. Likewise, users should respond to developers   evals.  PJ who said it, multiple evaluations, what exactly was evaluated.  WC ER info is not based on conformance but general info about what   functions tools provide.  @@CMN and WC pursue database technology.  JT we need a testing procedure in AU.  GR working on. have an item to do so.  Evaluation of tools  CMN AU has been evaluating tools against ATAG. AERT is not a normative   reference so there it is not possible to claim conformance. AERT is based   on WCAG. A tool could claim that it meets requirements of WCAG. There is a   secondary approach to conforming to AERT, not by fulfilling techniques but   by producing content that conforms to WCAG. This tool fixes these problems   in relation to WCAG. There is an RDF conformance scheme for the various WAI   guidelines and a tool that can pull this info together. Perhaps ER should   create a conformance evaluation tool. A test suite.  WC a test suite to evaluate tools?  CMN so that you could mark it off as you went.  CR we would like a set of test files to run through tools to see how they   support AERT.  JT that's also important. CMN is getting at a process to test an authoring   tool.  CMN In simplest form, a checklist of things to try. AU generates: here is   how we determine if we conform or not. Integrating that into WART and   produce RDF would be handy.  WC Not sure in our scope. Would like to take that back to ER WG for discussion.  CR agree.  @@WC take idea of other types of evaluation tools for ER. What exactly do   we mean by evaluation? Does it include evaluation of tools or limited to   evaluation of content?  GR Do tools actually work? As part of ER, I would hate to lose IG.  CMN AU and UA are not chartered to write code. On the other hand, it does   say that we look for things that we need in software. I do think they meet   the needs of ER in terms of a feedback loop.  WL As well as IG group. One of the tools that ER will not build is to   evaluate evaluators. There's no tool for that. That's done by people.  HB ER charter does suggest deliverables for ease of use.  WC Currently in ER draft charter we state that WCAG WG must evaluate our   tools to ensure we have interpreted WCAG correctly. Perhaps have a similar   situation with AU and UA.  GR ER is drafting techniques for application of WCAG in mechanical process   and that's what AU is doing. We're saying these are the guidelines, these   are what the tools should do. What's the difference?  JT We're referencing them. This is a side issue. CMN said that we may wish   to produce a tool to help evaluators evaluate authoring tools. WC has   action item to take to ER WG. AU needs to look at the piece in our charter   about producing the tool. The secondary issue is having a tool that   evaluates the evaluation tool. We extended that to the ATAG document.  CMN The tool to evaluate specifications is called W3C Member review.  JT Other thoughts about tools that evaluate tools?  HB One thing that is useful was a group of people getting together to fill   in a checklist. Could we get this info from the vendors.  JT We need an objective review process. Interrator reliability. It would be   useful to gather examples. How do we make the conformance evaluation   process foolproof?  CMN I don't think we have enough experience to answer the question. Let's   do it and see what we learn.  JT We need a number of evaluations of any one tool to determine where the   ambiguities and where we need to fix the process.  Other Business  CMN run the next meeting at this time? first tuesday in july?  WC that's the 4th of July.  @@Resolved: We will meet consistently on Tuesdays rather than switching   between Mondays (ER time) and Tuesdays (AU time).  JT When is our next meeting then?  WC monthly? Lots to do between now and then.  CMN good to keep in contact and refocusing on each others issues.  @@Resolved: Next joint meeting 11 July, same time same place.

        Hello,    I have been converting the CSS Techniques [1] from XHTML to the techinques DTD.  In doing so, I have made some tweaks to the DTD [2].  Some of the tweaks have been discussed but not added to the dtd, the rest are changes that made sense w/the work I've been doing. The DTD was last published in April [3]).    One issue:   we currently allow more than one "rule" element per technique, I think we ought to limit this to one.  As I mark up the CSS techs, this is what I'm doing and it seems much cleaner.    Here's the list of changes.   - added some documentation to the dtd.  - added wcag-tech element as the root element  - added "front-matter" and "doc-intro" elements as children of "wcag-tech."  (described in dtd documentation)  - added "name" attribute to category  - moved rule element as a child of "technique" rather than "description"  - added "test" element as child of "technique"  - added attribute "success-criteria" to "applies-to" element.  - added a list of attribute values to the "group" attribute on the "affects" element.  The list is taken from the Requirements from WCAG 2.0 document [4]    I expect we'll need to make a few more tweaks as we develop the transformations to generate the variety of documents we've discussed.    Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns about the changes that I have made.

Flicker is addressed in UAAG Guideline 3 [2], so we now have redundant  >requirements in WCAG 1.0 and UAAG 1.0.  I couldn't find a related issue in  >the WCAG 2.0 issue list [3].    As you pointed out, the relevant UAAG requirements are in Guideline 3.  The   only specfic mention I found of "flicker" is in the Techniques for UAAG   related to Checkpoint 3.4 Toggle scripts. (P1) (does not apply to   plug-ins,but does apply to applets) [4]. Although, several of the other   elements (e.g., images) could contain flicker and that being able to toggle   them on/off is important.    Regardless, as with many other requirements there is both a WCAG piece and   a UAAG piece.  The WCAG piece is typically "design and/or markup the   content so that it can transform"  the UAAG piece is typically "allow the   user to take advantage of the flexibility that the author has provided."    In the flicker case (as it relates to scripts), UAAG says, "[UA] Developers   should not consider that the user's ability to turn off scripts is an   effective way to improve content accessibility; turning off scripts means   losing the benefits they offer. Instead, developers should provide users   with finer control over user agent or content behavior known to raise   accessibility barriers. The user should only have to turn off scripts as a   last resort."    Thus, there is still a part within WCAG that needs to say "avoid flicker or   make it possible for the user to turn it off."    WCAG 2.0 addresses the issue with "Checkpoint 2.3 Avoid causing the screen   to flicker."  [5] I don't think we feel we are done and I think that   requirement b is likely to disappear, but we the minimum criterion   currently reads:  You will have successfully met Checkpoint 2.3 at the Minimum Level if:  At least one of the following is true:  a. content was not designed to flicker (or flash) in the range of 3 to 49 Hz.  b. Reviewer's Note: We would like to include a criteria here which would   state that a test that was conducted and the pages passed. No test or tool   exists yet though. We're looking into how such a test and/or tool might be   designed.  c. if flicker is unavoidable, the user is warned of the flicker before they   go to the page, and as close a version of the content as is possible   without flicker is provided.    >Wendy mentioned:  > >In the meantime, I heard back from Professor Harding and there is a system  > >that checks for flicker.

Looks like I forgot to follow-up on this.  As you said, it appears this   tool analyzes television broadcasts and doesn't appear that it will work on   web content.

What do you think of the Photo-Sensitive Epilepsy (PSE) Guidelines at:  http://www.films.demon.co.uk/online/pse.html    These are written for television, but seem fairly objective.

I would prefer to see this work happen in the WCAG WG.  This Thursday (12   December) we are having a techniques "kick-off" of sorts to discuss the   plans for the technology-specific aspect of WCAG.  If you look at the   thread discussing the requirements for the wcag 2.0 techniques [6], you'll   see that what was previously AERT [7] will become part of the   technology-specifics for WCAG 2.0.    >If we look at it from the view point of someone representing 100's or  >1,000's of web authors and pages, for example from a government agency or  >large company view - how do I evaluate if any of my 1,000's of pages have  >bad flicker or not?

We've been discussing this series of questions and hoping that EARL could   help provide some of the answers (i.e., as the content passes through   different hands, if each tool understood EARL then the answers to these   questions could move around with the content).    Specific to the flicker issue, as you suggested in your email, we need   someone to develop a tool that applies the ideas of the Harding tool to Web   content.    >To close this thread, I propose that [...]    Since I think that the 3 action items you proposed are all within the scope   of the WCAG WG, I will answer that part of the email on that mailing list.

        Hello,    At today's telecon we discussed possible dates and locations for future F2F   meetings.  Here is the information I promised:    1. W3C All Group Meeting (a.k.a. the Technical Plenary). 3 - 7 March, Royal   Sonesta Hotel, Cambridge, MA USA  2. Conference on "Technology and Persons with Disabilities" (a.k.a. CSUN).   17-22 March, L.A., CA USA    Information from last year's technical plenary is available. [1]  One   possibility is for a small group to attend the technical plenary and   solicit feedback from other W3C groups then bring that feedback to a   regular working group meeting that would occur after CSUN.    Another possibility is to have two meetings with different goals.  One   could focus on technology-specifics (i.e., a working meeting similar to   Linz) and the other could be regular meeting.    Please send your preference for date and venue to me, Gregg, and   Jason.  Also, be sure to let us know if you support the idea of organizing   two meetings (one at the plenary and one at csun).    Thank you,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/07/allgroupoverview.html    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--        

      Hi all,    I think GL is done debating about what to use as alt-text.  It seems that   we would  rather be encouraging authors to use style sheets for   positioning.  While I agree with this, it is not entirely realistic today   due to the inconsistent support for CSS positioning.  Therefore, I propose   the following for the ERT document:    1.  Images with alt="", alt=" ", and alt=" " (or alt=" ") should   be flagged.    2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., <a   href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=" ">Refer to our home page</a>)   this is o.k.    3.  If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the   image.    3a. If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those   words should not be separated, advise them to use   (or alt=" ")   instead of an image.    3b. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of   the page, advise them to provide a brief descriptive text and suggest that   they may also want to link to a longer description of the image with the   "longdesc" attribute.    Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style   sheets, such as graphical list bullets.  Advise authors to use style   sheets.  (See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document)    3c.  If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text,   advise them to use style sheets or alt=" ".    3d.  If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to   provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary link to a longer   description.    Any further thoughts from GL?  I am also including the last message on this   thread, sent by Jason White on 18 November.  --wendy      >Resent-Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1999 18:20:58 -0500 (EST)  >Date: Thu, 18 Nov 1999 10:20:20 +1100 (EST)  >From: Jason White <jasonw@ariel.ucs.unimelb.EDU.AU>  >To: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>  >Subject: Re: proposal for "null" alt-text (was "Re: GL's   >interpretation   of    null alt-text")  >Resent-From: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >X-Mailing-List: <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org> archive/latest/2549  >X-Loop: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >Sender: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org  >Resent-Sender: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org  >  >I agree entirely with Nir's position: it is better to advise authors to  >use more appropriate techniques, particularly CSS, than to waste time  >debating the merits of various text equivalents for so-called "spacer  >images".

        Hello,    Minutes are available at:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/07/f2f-minutes.html    The minutes still need more work but I figure something is better than nothing.  If you have questions, please ask and I will try to make it clearer in the minutes.     Several documents were produced during the meeting, I will get copies from participants and post to the w3c site.  I will link to these from the minutes and from the related ETA items that will be generated.    I will be adding tasks and issues into the ETA system after I am back in my office next week.  Many of these will not be assigned to people since they need to check with management before committing.    Thanks to all who participated!

      Gregg,    Good comments! I made most of these edits, a few I have marked as open   issues and will be adding them to the open issues list.  I also have   comments on a few of your suggestions.    ITEM 1  >WORDING IN THE INTRODUCTION  >  >3. A final point on this introduction is that we have to be careful not to  >imply that someone needs to follow all of the checkpoints in order to  >satisfy the guideline.  If the checkpoints give alternatives, we somehow  >should combine them and word them so that it's clear that when you do one of  >the two alternatives you have satisfied the issue.  Again, we can talk about  >this more when we talk about specific checkpoints.    I have documented this as an open issue.    >ITEM 2  >  >"Principle 1:  Ensure that all content can be presented through any single  >sensory channel or a combination of sensory channels that may be required by  >the user (e.g. all information only through vision or only through hearing,  >etc.)"  >    I did not take this wording since Marti had made the comment about the use   of "sensory channel" and I agree that it can be a bit hard to   understand.  Hopefully my proposed wording captures your ideas.    >ITEM 3  >  >Under Guideline 1.1 we talk about talking about a text equivalent for all  >non-text.  I would like to somehow get in here the idea that this needs to  >be electronic text.  Text by itself cannot be translated into any form but  >electronic text can.  Again, since we are talking about very general  >principles, I would like to eliminate right off the bat anyone thinking that  >putting a painted image of text on the screen solves the problem.

I did not make this edit.  I would like to know more about the "wide   variety of technologies in the future used to representative   information."  I am concerned that these are all electrons and that   "electronic text" is not the best clarification and actually may confuse   people.      >ITEM  4    Added as open issue.      >ITEM  5    open issue.  wording for current WCAG 1.3 is in process. we'll see how that   goes.    >ITEM  6 - 11    done.    >ITEM  12  >  >Priorities.    open issue.      >ITEM  13 - 22    done.

        Hello,    Michael and I chatted last week about a couple of concrete examples and   wondered how they would look in an HTML checklist.  Here's an attempt to   describe some of the issues:    Checkpoint 1.1, Minimum level success criterion 1 says, "non-text content   that can be expressed in words has a text-equivalent explicitly associated   with it."    Checkpoint 1.1, Example 1: an image used as a button. (short description of   function)  A right arrow icon is used to link to the next slide in a slide show. The   text equivalent is "Next Slide," so that what is read by a screen reader   would be "link: Next Slide."    Checkpoint 1.1, Example 5: an audio file of a symphony. (short label)  An audio file is embedded in a Web page. The short label says, "Beethoven's   5th Symphony performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra."    In the HTML checklist, we expect to have a true/false statement that says   something like: any image (embedded with the img element) that can be   expressed in words has a text-equivalent explicitly associated with it via   the alt attribute.  **Note: there is not consensus that the statements would read like   this.  This is just an example for demonstrative and discussion   purposes.  Please feel free to improve the wording.    We have said that every success criterion must have a true/false statement   so that the user has to check off something for each success criterion [0].   This example of a true/false statement would apply to Example 1 but not   Example 5.    However, since the two success criteria have an "or" relationship, I   believe it might make more sense for the user to have one checkbox for the   two ala:    [ true/false]  any image (embedded with the img element) that can be expressed in words   has a text-equivalent explicitly associated with it via the alt attribute.  OR  any image (embedded with the img element) that can not be expressed in   words has a descriptive label provided as its text- equivalent via the alt   attribute.    However, for a conformance claim, you will want to have checks for each   success criterion.  But, is it easy to understand the following (using   Example 1 as the example)?  [ true ] any image (embedded with the img element) that can be expressed in   words has a text-equivalent explicitly associated with it via the alt   attribute.  [ false ] any image (embedded with the img element) that can not be   expressed in words has a descriptive label provided as its text- equivalent   via the alt attribute.    What about the longdesc attribute and other forms of description?  [true/false] any image (embedded with the img element) that can be   expressed in words has a text-equivalent explicitly associated with it via   the longdesc attribute.    This is additional to the first statement (marked as true).  Thus, we have   a variety of relationships:  AND, OR, and additional.  How does the   "additional" map back to the checkpoints and success criteria?  In this   example, it seems to map back to the first success criterion, but with an   "additional" relationship.    Summary and questions:  - success criteria seem to have at least 3 types of      relationships: and, or, and additional (or "stacked").      What about the "at least one of" type as in   2.2 [1]      What about exceptions as in checkpoint 1.2 [2]?  - how does html:longdesc map back to checkpoint 1.1?  -  How do we want to deal with these relationships and      mappings in our xml?  We had some discussion last      week about internal data vs external metadata to      describe the relationships. Similar debate to using      internal style sheets vs external. If external only have      to fix changes in one spot.  - what will the true/false statements for techniques look      like?  are the examples given above similar to what      people have had in mind? if not, please provide examples      of what you've been expecting.  - i would like to see more concrete examples used in discussion.    --wendy    [0] http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-tech-req/#req-checklists  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#avoid-interfering  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/#time-based    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  http://www.w3.org/WAI/  /--         

      As I was working on a proposal for Technique 13.6.1, I looked at the   sections in WCAG10-TECHS, ATAG10-TECHS, and AERT that are related to this   technique.   I am trying to figure out a proposal for how ATAG10-TECHS and   AERT refer to each other.    First compare what ATAG10-TECHS says for this technique vs. what currently   exists in the AERT:    ATAG10-TECHS checkpoint 3.2  [http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-ATAG10-TECHS-20000504/#gl-prewritten-descs]:  <blockquote>  WCAG Checkpoint 13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user   agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group.   [Priority 3]  Techniques for WCAG checkpoint 13.6  HTML  Ask authors if lists of links are a group and should be a map.  </blockquote>    Note that it has an HTML specific technique.    Compare this to the current text in AERT for Technique 13.6.1   [http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#group-links]  <blockquote>  Suggested message:           Groups of links should be grouped with a structural element.    Suggested repair:           Ask the user if an identified list of links should be grouped.           If the user wants to group the links, use one of the following   techniques           a MAP element           SPAN or DIV with appropriate "title"           Suggest that the user provide a link to bypass the group or that   they move the group to the bottom of the page or that they use a high   "tabindex" attribute value.  </blockquote>    What is in ATAG10-TECHS is a watered down version of what's in AERT, what   should really be there?   A link to AERT?  This works better with the   proposal I sent to the list than with what currently exists in the   AERT.  It also seems that the ATAG10-TECHS ought to link to the   WCAG10-HTML-TECHS section on grouping links.    Thoughts?    --wendy    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--         

      I have left it as "determine" because the author isn't necessarily   performing the tests, per se;  the tool is. The author may just be looking   at the information from the tool (as with the WAVE) to determine if their   page conforms.    thanks for the suggestion, tho.  --wendy    At 05:05 PM 9/12/00 , Dick Brown wrote:  >I suggest a slight rewording to sharpen the focus (new words between  >asterisks):  >"...make it easier for Web content developers to *test whether* Web content  >conforms..."  >  >Dick Brown  >Program Manager, Web Accessibility  >Microsoft Corp.  >www.microsoft.com/enable  >  >  >-----Original Message-----  >From: Wendy A Chisholm [mailto:wendy@w3.org]  >Sent: Tuesday, September 12, 2000 1:53 PM  >To: Kynn Bartlett  >Cc: w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org  >Subject: Re: mission statement  >  >  >Kynn,  >  > >There's no such thing as "accessible or not".

      If people would like to book a room through CWI, note that you must send   them a note by the end of the day Monday.    CWI will try to get rooms through a booking agent.    It's my understanding that Amsterdam is very popular this time of year and   that rooms are scarce.  We are not guaranteed that the booking agent will   be successful, in which case we all might be on our own for booking hotel   rooms.    If you have not already sent your information, please send the following   information to w3c-netherlands@w3.org:  your name  the date and time you arrive in Amsterdam  how many nights you require a hotel room in Amsterdam    Thank you,  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

They are marked in red as prefaced with   the phrase, "New for QA:"  I also made the minor editorial comments   discussed at last week's telecon:  1. in "mission" replaced "produce guidelines for the development of   accessible Web content"  with "produce guidelines for accessible Web content"  2. in "scope" made "W3C Recommendations" in the 2nd bullet link to the list   of W3C Recommendations.  3. in "deliverables"  Replaced "Requirements for Techniques" with the   correct title of "Requirements for WCAG 2.0 Checklists and Techniques"    In the QA template charter, it has a section for milestones [3].  I did not   add a milestone section but added a bullet to the list of deliverables that   says, "A list of proposed  milestones, to be updated accordingly" and links   to a separate page of milestones.  We have something like this in our   current charter.

      The main question I think we ought to be focusing on, and where I thought   this thread started, was if client-side scripting techniques were   accessible.  We keep trying to figure out if we should assume that   ecmascript be supported.    Jim states that scripting is not safe and therefore questions if we should   support it.  It is my experience that client-side scripting is used quite   often for security reasons.  For example, when submitting personal data to   a site, if you have to continue sending it back to the server for data   verification, each time it is sent through the 'net is a possible security   breach. therefore, many sites prefer to do the verification on the   client-side to avoid possible security breaches as the info travels the 'net.      Also, it decreases the response time and gives the user a better   experience.  Instead of waiting for data to be sent to the server,   processed, and returned, using the client's machine for the verification   decreases server load and increases response time.    There are many good cases that e-commerce sites build for using scripting.    As for the question if scripting has ever been used to make an inaccessible   site accessible - yes it has.  When I worked at the Trace R&D Center, Mark   Novak created a javascript that would let the user navigate a table.  This   was before user agents or assistive technologies were able to navigate   tables cell by cell, row by row, column by column.  I have also seen a   client-side script that creates a navigation window that hovers over a page   creating large icons for people who do not move well.    I don't see client-side scripting disappearing. Matter of fact, with SMIL,   SVG, etc I only see its use increasing. I do not think it is useful to   debate how to make it go away or how to completely avoid it - as I   interpreted some of your message, Jim.  Please correct me if I have   misunderstood.  Instead, let's try to answer the questions and debate the   scenarios that Gregg posed in his original e-mail:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/1048.html    508 says you can use scripts, if functional text is provided - in other   words if they are usable by a screen reader.  Access Board's info: http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(l)    I don't think this is an unreasonable request.    More info:  National Cancer Institute: http://oc.nci.nih.gov/web508/tut-l.html    It's similar to saying, "use style sheets for HTML, but make sure the page   is readable without them."    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      Authoring Tool WG (AUWG),  Web Content WG (WCAG WG),  and WAI IG,    The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERWG) has been working on   the Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content   Accessibility Guidelines [1].  This document describes techniques that Web   accessibility validation tools may use to evaluate the conformance of HTML   documents to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0). This   document also describes techniques that Web authoring tools may use to help   authors modify HTML documents to conform to WCAG 1.0. We anticipate that   tool developers may develop accessibility validation and/or repair modules   to be incorporated into commercial authoring tools, validation tools, and   perhaps user agents.    The ERWG believes this document is ready to be published as a public   working draft, but would like comments from AUWG, WCAG WG, and WAI IG   before moving forward.  This document still needs work - thus it is a   working draft.  You will notice several double at-signs (@@) throughout the   document which mark open issues, questions, and other to-do's.  There is   also a list of to-do's at the beginning of the document.  We would   appreciate comments on these as well as any other comments that you may have.    This review period will end Thursday, April 6 2000.  Please send review   comments before that date to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org.  Archives for this list   are at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/.

      Our next teleconference will be held Monday, 15 October 2001 at the   regularly scheduled time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time (14:00 UTC/GMT).  To find   out what time it is in your time zone use the Time Zone Converter [1].    It will take place on the MIT bridge: +1 617.258.7910    Agenda for Monday:    - EARL 1.0?  Sean has suggested that we move to 1.0 and in doing so, change the   structure of the assertions a bit and expanding what we mean by   testSubjects (e.g., identifying new resources by line number).  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Oct/0010.html    Charles responded that we ought to play with 0.95 further, while SBP was   concerned about having people implement 0.95 then moving to 1.0.    Sean says, "I think that it was a mistake to specify the model and syntax   in one recommendation, because it gets people thinking that the syntax   specified therein is the only possible serialization, or (perhaps even   worse) the best possible serialization. "  I'm assuming the recommendation   you are referring to is RDF or are you referring to EARL?    - Timeline  I would like to have a complete end-to-end process demonstrable by CSUN for   a session I hope to give (I'm submitting my proposal this week).  That   gives us 5 months to get the pieces together - which seems   reasonable!  Pieces that we need:  1. test files.  we already have a bunch from Josh and Chris and hopefully WCAG will be   generating more, although since they are tied up in larger issues perhaps   we ought to create more of them.  2. A tool that will collect results from a variety of evaluation tools  This will be the non-existent WART that Charles Munat has already agreed to   work with me on.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WART/plan.html  3. A tool that will create a report from the results of WART.  Should be   easy to create an XSLT to do this.    - Test specification languages  I sent a note this week about some of the languages I had found.  What do   people think the next step should be?  This seems to be part of the   end-to-end process...although the suite of test files could be used instead   of test specifications...unless we want to wrap each test file in meta info   about the test...  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Oct/0011.html    - Test suites  UAAG is meeting next week to discuss a test suite for UAAG conformance.  I   will attend the meeting to promote use of EARL and likely volunteer us to   work on a tool that will generate EARL to store results of tests.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/10/ftf-agenda.html    - QA  The QA Activity is having their first F2F meeting Nov 12-13 in Brussels   (Belgium).  http://www.w3.org/2001/11/qa-f2f-agenda.html  EARL is on the agenda.  Are there specific questions we would like raised   or topics discussed?  The primer should be ready for that   meeting.  <illustration>Wendy kicks self yet again to get action finished   to work on primer</illustration>    Be well,  --wendy    [1] http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      hello,    in the Evaluation and Repair Tools working group we have been discussing   how to evaluate and repair tables.  Particularly, nested tables.    if nested tables are used to present data, is there a way to associate the   cells in the inner table with header cells in the outer table?  I would   assume that axis and headers could work  across tables (if a UA was built   that way).  However, in HTML 4.0 the only values for "scope" are row, col,   rowgroup, and colgroup.  so, it seems that "scope" could *not* be an inner   table.    Nested tables seem less of a problem for layout tables. I propose that the   evaluation and repair is to handle each table separately, like Mark Novak's   HelpDB tool.    --wendy  <>  wendy a chisholm (wac)  world wide web consortium (w3c)  web accessibility initiative (wai)  madison, wisconsin (madcity, wi)  united states of america (usa)  tel: +1 608 663 6346  </>        

      here is my proposal based on today's discussion (refer to the minutes from   the call at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000131.html):    Technique 1.1.8 [priority 1] Check FRAME elements for valid "longdesc"   attribute  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  FRAME elements should have a valid "longdesc" attribute if the value of   the  FRAME "title" attribute does not completely describe the frame   content.  Refer to techniques for checkpoint 12.1  If a FRAMESET has three or more frames and does not have a "longdesc"   attribute, ask the user if the relationships between frames are not   apparent in the titles for each frame.  Valid "longdesc" file name:  Must not be NULL  Must be a valid URI  Example Language:  Missing "longdesc": Missing 'long description' file for this frame.  Invalid "longdesc" file name: Invalid 'long description' file name for this   frame: [current "longdesc" file name] - [can not be empty].  Repair Technique:  If the relationships betweeen frames are not obvious then ask that they   provide a description of the relationships. Allow the user to create a   "longdesc" file or associate an existing "longdesc" file.

The current version is at: http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-AERT-20000426  The latest is at:  http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT    This means that we will aim to publish our next public working draft (at   the latest) by the end of July.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Summary    - everyone should review and comment on SBP's EARL 1.0 schema  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Oct/0063.html    - SBP asked if EARL should be on the W3C Rec track. No one was eager to do so, but there would be benefits. WC is going to take the question to the WAI team.    - The two methods that seem most likely to associate EARL and content are as an annotation and via the link element in HTML.  Can't say we will only use one or the other since there are audiences for both.  However, makes retrieving earl a bit more complicated since both methods have to be implemented.  It seems the best thing to do now is to implement and test.  Jim is working on annotations [1].  Perhaps if Nick or someone else were to work on html:link?  Seems that our user scenarios need work.  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/2001JulDec/0033.html    Al has also been talking about a portal, but we all realized we weren't sure we knew what he was saying - Al - help?    - Since there is an issue of costs and attending the calls, we decided to hold the next meeting on IRC.  This will be on 12 November 2001.  clients and other info available at: http://www.irchelp.org/  Once you set up a client here is the relevant info:  server: irc.w3.org  port: 6665  channel: #er    I hang out there when I am connected.  type "wendy" to get my attention. If you have trouble, please send me e-mail and I'll try to help you work out any kinks before the meeting.      Detailed minutes    where does the earl go?  * wendy summarizes discussion  SBP RSS discussions about mime-type. went ahead to register.  .. since so structural.  .. don't think earl needs one - should be the same as the serialization as RDF.  .. if EARL in XML RDF get RDF, if use n3 get whatever is used for that, RDF core currently saying text/plain  .. but I don't agree w/that. it's an app.  HB text/plain sufficiently generic that what we do should work w/it.  SBP Don't see much sense in mime-types. provide a hint, but just process. if it works great, if not, tough.  .. w/earl, could link to it.  Link that says, "this links to earl profile" a portal (from al)  .. not sure if we would want to do that.  HB If several people assess the same site would we need to link among them.  SBP that would tie back into what al is talking about. from portal, link to diff results for diff people for a page.  .. link to profile, profile link to all results.  HB Gain any political benefit by encouraging people to put a link to beginning of portal whether has result for htem or not.  SBP The more tech we introduce, more for people to learn. Languages like RIDL would be perfect for that.  CR Not sure makes sense to link from the page to EARL.  If a center evaluating sites for accessibility, would not be able to modify the page itself.  WC Think both models: as annotation and as linked to from w/in the content would be useful.  .. conscious author and evaluator.  WC SBP how this related to 1.0?  SBP One bug: date. Mostly just making more stable.  NIck has been complaining that there is not a spec,  .. learning from examples.  .. said difficult.  .. bits of it here and there.  .. schema is prime defn. need to knwo rdf schema to read.  WC I was to work on primer, you and Nick to save msgs in www-archive for us to use as reference.  SBP thought we had discussed more.  HB Self-interest, if expect things like Goggle to find it, put a link in if knew there were one.  SBP Nick and Jim said they would write something that would grab from link element.  WC sounds like at least two options, through link in HTML and as annotation.  SBP Discussions don't really seem to be going anywhere w/annotea.  WC Just presented paper. Interesting scenario, class learning about web content.  Teacher annotates w/earl, Students take and fix.  Proposed resolution: get implementations of both methods: earl in annotation and earl linked to from LINK element in HTML content.  ... xlink.    EARL 1.0  SBP Nick invented some properties, like line numbers. Should adopt into 1.0?  .. also Len's BNF to XML thing.  .. xpointers. ways of pointing to content that you are evaluating.  .. a case of how much you put in or say "you have to implement this."  .. earl is a framework. doesn't say much beyond, Here's how to annotate something.  .. doesn't get into the details.  .. that's what nick did, by pointing to line numbers.  .. pointing to a site or range of pages w/in a site.  .. you could say this piece of earl is for an entire site except these 3...  .. priority levels of things it excludes, go into detail.  .. depends on how much we want to put in 1.0. how much we expect them to implement.  .. how comfortable people will be inventing properties.  .. NK invented line and col #. He needed properties to point to that.  .. if someone else also invent them, they would have to create a diff transformation.  .. but concept of the semantic web.  .. people are not comfortable. Jim said "earl doesn't have a method to point to a whole site"  .. i said could use a variety of RDF things, and Jim wasn't comfortable w/that. Perhaps should be in EARL.  .. if it's there, people would feel more obliged to implement it.  .. if don't put it in, won't have to implement.    WC annotations...  SBP annotation and earl should be different and separate.  .. if annotaiton is only how to find earl then does not affect what earl says.  .. that's my worry. have 2 page addresses.  HB takin this to QA?  WC Yes.  SBP If specs are to give out EARL evaluations, they need EARL to have an official grounding.   .. EARL should be on Rec track  .. if used as site-wide thing.  WC At F2F talked about XAG being on Rec but not EARL  SBP prety sure we talked about it w/WL, he said would be daft.  WC Should EARL be on the Rec track?  CR Doesn't matter, would slow it down. I would say no, but not a strong opinion.  HB No strong opinion.  SBP As long as a clear status and know it won't disappear.  As long as people can feel comfortable using. When moves to QA won't get reorged.  WC All ther easons we gave to take XAG to Rec could be applied to EARL.    Action WC: Take questions of EARL to Rec to WAI team.    SBP Test case that ATR has are HTML files, WCAG would be a spec checkpoint (in the spec) rather than bits of tech.  .. thought we needed to properties for that.  WC Will NK have many changes if move to 1.0?  SBP not sure.  12 November - next mtg  WC for future meetings - just irc, mix of irc and phone (including jim's broadcast).  .. do we want to try 12 november meeting as just irc?  HB In lieu of telephone?    next meeting: 12 November, only IRC no voice.        

      We are moving forward with holding a face2face meeting in Bristol, England   5 and 6 October.  It has been proposed that the Authoring Tool Working Group join us to   discuss the revision of WCAG on the afternoon of the 6th.    How do people feel about this opportunity to discuss the current state of   the draft with another working group?  Do you feel we will need the full   two days to work on the draft?

        Hello Maurizio,    >-where we must place the information architet role: in the navigation  >designer, in the interaction designer, content creator or what?  >-where we place the usability specialist? In the 'site tester' role?  >That doesn't seem really clear.    What responsibilities does the architect have in making a site   accessible?  Do they differ greatly from other roles that are listed?  If   not, can we combine them in some way?    The point of the exercise is not to create an exhaustive list of all   possible roles that people may play in the Web site development   process.  The point (as I see it - feel free to disagree) is to figure out   the different types of information that people need.  If the needs of an   information architect differ greatly from a designer, then we ought to   address them as separate entities.  If not, then we ought to find a general   category that represents them both.    Perhaps by answering my questions we can answer yours. :)    Thanks,  --wendy    --   wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--

      Next Teleconference: Monday, March 19, 2001, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time   (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1 617-258-7910)    Len sends regrets, so I will be chairing the meeting.    1. EARL properties details   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2001Mar/0015.html    What are people's thoughts? What else do people need to move forward on   this (i.e. implement something)?  What's missing? What questions do people   have?      2. Timeline. Len and I propose the following:    1. Express daniel's EARL properties details in N3 (by next week?)  2. Hand simulate some output  3. Generate a report based on hand simulation  4. Merge multiple outputs into a single report  5. Have a tool output a report (WAVE, a-prompt?)  6. Write machine readable tests (express the test conditions in a   machine-readable format.  These are the "rule sets" that we've talked   about. i.e. a rule set for 508, one for WCAG 1.0, one for WCAG 2.0, and one   for "my favorite company's internal rules")  7. Have a tool output a report based on human and machine checks  8. Have a tool input a single report (Amaya?)  9. Have a tool merge multiple inputs    If done correctly, the code for 3,4,5 would be the same as 7,8,9.  We're looking for volunteers to implement and comments on the   timeline.  What are realistic dates to shoot for? How do we divvy up the work?  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Gregg    #25  resolved: closed  hardships: documenting "other way out" as possibility.    #42  resolved: closed    #45  CMN this is not closed. may be subsumed into #46 - illustrating text.  resolved: subsume into #46    #1  WC I think handed by "How People with..."  CMN Can people use javascript. Technical question.  JW Techniques.  CMN need a checkpoint - work without javascript.  JW ECMAscript checkpoints.  CMN arise in any language that could incorporate javascript - everything   except CSS.  CM We're talking about client-side. Sounds more specific than most checkpoints.  CS Not so much checkpoint issue as meta issue. WCAG 1.0 says don't use   scripting, most do. should we be changing. Gets into until user agents.   Stating assumptions.  GR UAAG changed a lot since then. UAs are no longer just GUI on desktop,   but on phones etc.  JW User agents on desktop do support scripting, mobile devices may not.  JM Top 5 questions I get from people.  CS I'm not at the moment advocating user agent capabilities, but we should   state them.  WC This is user agent capabilities discussion, then. Therefore, we ought to   combine.  Resolved: 1, 6, 15, 28, 40 are all about assumptions and technologies.   combine them.  CS all agree need to document, but haven't agreed on what they are.    Interface and presentation issues  WC Paul has started these threads on the list. Start here?  JW Personally read it as one doc rather than separate. Generating into   separate files ok, as long as have single source.  KHS Yes, also good for printing.  CS Yes. Divided or single just 2 views. Many are divided like that.  PB I envision when you go to the main page have toc and preliminary info,   then either view as single page or in modularized version.  MM GL index page.  JW Also proposals for a few other forms. Source available so people can   create their own if needed.  PB Yes. One source file best.  Resolved. Multiple chapters as well as a single source.  JW Modularization is conformance issue not presentaiton.  KHS With the glossary you arrive at the chapters version but can   immediately go to full version.  JW How is the glossary going?  WC should discuss at F2F. PB go over?  PB handled on list.    #41  JW Think it's covered.  WC no mention of audio-only in the sucess criteria of 1.2.  KHS What about online radio?  JW Handled by transcripts.  GR Media equivalents defn is too narrow.  Action: WC ask GV if covered.  Action GR: definition for media equivalents.  JW Provide transcripts after the fact.  GR 1.2 does not define anything used in the checkpoint.  Action GR: e-mail Anttie and Kitch to ask about what the deaf community   finds acceptable for real-time events.    #67  WC ask Geoff Freed or someone at WBGH.  JW GV didn't want a number.  Action WC: Ask Geoff.    #57  WC don't actually input data into data model.  CM Depends on how use it.  JW Intedned to cover cases where structural identifiers do not have syntax   of language. database, PDF file,e tc. don't want to say attributed tree -   imposes structure. categorization of content in terms of identifiers,   classes, or labels in case of XML - element names. accessible by API or   file format, goes beyond markup.  WC Refering to semantics - relationships between pieces of data.  GR think 1.3 is success criteria of 1.5.  CM PUrpose of 1.3? diff seems to be "use structure" vs "separate structure   from..."  WC Repurposing.  CM "Use markup or equivalent"  CS I like that.  WC Yes, although use of "equivalent" is overused.  CS Or drop "use markup..."  CM Provide structure in a manner that allows repurposing  Action CM: look at GR's post for success criteria for 1.5 and think about   how to write "Provide structure in a manner that allows repurposing" could   replace the current 1.3. Definition of repurpose?    #69  CM and LG drop adjective altogether.  CS and KHS agree.  JW although "language of text" could be programming language.  CM Does it add more confusion or decrease it?  JW Technically correct.  CS Never in favor of moving exactness. Language without a modifier is   ambiguous.  JM We could just define it, that would solve for everyone.  Resolved: keep use of "natural" and link to definition - which follows.    #75  JW Identifying natural language another caes of identifying semantics.   Similar to requirements of 1.3. Not really structural but many of the   semantic distinctions are not structural - in strict sense of the term.   Either separate checkpoint on semantics or widen concept of structure.  WC right, all about repurposing. CM consider in 1.3 proposal?  CM yes, agree.  Action CM: also think about including 1.4 in 1.3 as another case of   repurposable - ua does something when encounters change in language.    #4  WC Another issue with 1.3?  JW UAAG took an issue about this. Making class names available.  CM Worked with that issue. Built all pages with XHTML strict. Used   sidebars. Label it sidebar in style sheet, make label invisible in style   sheet. Specific to what you are doing. WL makes a good point, goes beyond   user agent. Styles are used to convey information. Want to encode as much   of semantics into doc as you can. Then if lose presentation you don't lose   that info.  JM CSS techniques.  CM Yes. But, the issue as rasied here affect 1.5?  JW don't think it's an issue.  CM sidebars can be inserted into flow of text when style sheets are not on   and interrupt flow of text.  WC fix by putting that paragraph last or first rather than within the document.  CM Also falls under 1.3.  WC Primarily a CSS problem?  JW Make happen in XSLT.  Action WC: ask wl if #4 is resolved.    $Date: 2001/08/23 21:42:59 $ Wendy Chisholm    --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      I like the advanced options and the ability to filter information.    1. I forgot to enter a URI to check, and it still gave me a report! Pretty   sparse but "http://" passed.    2.  I've been checking and unchecking the browser and HTML options and it   doesn't seem to change my result any.  It seems to only give feedback for   HTML 4.0, even if HTML 4.0 is not checked.  I tried this with both   www.w3.org and www.cnn.com    3. I would still like to see an interactive checklist as a second step of   the process where the user is asked questions and must check something off   before seeing their results.  Their results would then include what they   have checked off or not.    It's looking good!  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hello,    I updated the Techniques open issues list [1] by going through the list of   open issues to determine if some of them had actually been resolved but   were lingering as open issues.  Note that I did *not* go through the   archive looking for issues.  Therefore, as Jason suggested in the agenda   yesterday, if you have an issue that has not been dealt with, please   resubmit it.    Also, please note that these are not issues with the Guidelines and   Checkpoints - those are currently being addressed in the Requirements   Document [2].  Therefore, if you have an issue with Guidelines or   Checkpoints make sure that it is covered in some way in the Requirements   Document.    I was able to close 6:  15. Specifying foreground and background colors  16. Why use EMBED/NOEMBED for applets instead of APPLET  17. Table examples (PRE)  18. Label in form example  19. Content negotiation  20. Grouping and bypassing links    10 are still open, some of these have been discussed on the list.  Several   seem like they will be simple to close, but I wanted to get group consensus   and not make any assumptions.  1. "accesskey" example  2. Proposal for accessible list example  3. Spacer images examples  4. Bidirectional tables  5. Using invisible images to provide redundant text links for server-6.   side image maps  6. CSS generated text  7. User agent support page  8. Satisfying the alternative page checkpoint with phone, fax, or postal   address.  9. Technique for server-side maps  10. Abbreviations for table headers    I added a section called "To do's".  This is a known list of things that   need to be added to or edited in the Techniques modules.  There are 8 items   on this list:  1. Missing discussion on checkpoint 7.3 - Lots of work on Scripting in   non-W3C technologies module (incorporate lessons from MWC page).  2. Add SMIL module.  3. Add SVG module  4. Make sure all content from CSS Accessibilty Features note is   incorporated into CSS module  5. Extend CSS module to include positioning and include more technical   examples.  6. Add MathML module  7. Add PDF info to non-W3C technologies module  8. More work on Flash section of non-W3C technologies module.    Are there other open issues that should be added to the list of open   issues?  Other to-do's that should be added to the to-do list?  Are there   volunteers to do any of the to-do's?  I've put some people's names next to   them (mostly mine <grin/>).    thanks,  --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-req-20000419.html  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

Better in that case to use a class to span across table cells, but   then that seems pretty silly.    I think the ideal solution is to either work with the author to include all   of the navigation links in one cell, or one row, or to entirely  nest a new   table into one cell of the existing table (although these all sound pretty   ugly although very likely).  perhaps there may be some overlap with helping   the author convert a table for layout to style sheets (in an idealistic   future where CSS positioning is supported, of course).    >giving a tabindex 1 after the map isn't enough - in implementations, the  >tabindex goes to the things with explicit tabindex then starts from the top  >of the page (so it isn't all that helpful in genereal <sigh/>).

There are 4 pieces to the repair   action:  1. create an A element immediately following the group of links.  2. put a name on it.  3. put a tabindex=1 on it  4. put an A element immediately before the group of links that links to the   "A name" that you just created.    Obviously, I need to make that clearer in the proposed text:    If the user wants to bypass a group of links and wants to include a link on     the page:     - Insert an A element with "name=foo"  and "tabindex=1" just after     the group of links or wherever you want the user to end up when they   skip the group of links.     - Insert an A element just before the group of links with "href=foo"    --wendy    >On Mon, 17 Jul 2000, Wendy A Chisholm wrote:  >  >   Hello,  >  >   My proposal for AERT Technique 13.6.1 is as follows.  >  >   <blockquote>  >   Technique 13.6.1 [Priority 3] Grouping links.  >  >   Discussion status  >   The suggested authoring technique is not widely supported by user agents.  >  >   Evaluation  >  >   Triggers  >   Several A elements separated by  >   spaces, bullets, or other characters such as "] [" or " | "  >   BR elements,  >   LI elements,  >   TD elements (i.e. A is the only element in a series of TDs, or A with   > inner  >   IMGs are the only elements in a series of TDs)  >  >   Requirement  >   Links should be grouped by MAP elements.

      Benjamin,    Please be aware that an Erratum was issued on 23 November 1999 that says   you do not need to use relative units on raster images. [1]    The full text of this erratum is:  <blockquote>  5. Relative units and sizing of images.  Added: 23 November 1999.  Type: Minor  Refers to: Checkpoint 3.4 of 5 May 1999 version  Description (and correction). The note for Checkpoint 3.3 should say         something about the effect of proportional sizing on raster images as         follows:  "Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language         attribute values and style sheet property values. [Priority 2] For         example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or         'cm', which are absolute units. If absolute units are used, validate         that the rendered content is usable (refer to the section on         validation). For example, do not proportionally size raster       images."  </blockquote>    I do not understand your question about "hot spots."  Hot spots are usually   regions of images used to define an image map.    --wendy    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA  At 05:06 PM 7/28/00 , Benjamin J.

        (not related to David's question):  I should clarify that in my previous message I was disagreeing that we need   to write a new success criterion and that I believe Guideline 4.1 is   sufficient.

If they are not, why not?    Could you explain why this should be a success criterion? I think this is   too specific for a success criterion and propose that we generalize the   idea and expand on it in Techniques.  In other words, we can provide   examples and general guidance about writing good titles.  Publishing a   report online could be one example.    >Also, "context-rich titles" is extremely subjective.    Yes, "context-rich" is subjective.

      Hello,    I just updated the list of to-do's in the techniques open issues list [1]    I think we'll want to have a scripting section for each technology with a   DOM implementation.  For example, I thought about moving scripting from the   HTML module to the non-w3c technologies module.  I don't think that will   work since the current scripting techniques are tied to the HTML DOM.    After I published the draft today I realized that I did not link to the   non-w3c module from the various checkpoints within the main module.  e.g.,   after checkpoint 6.3 we currently link to:  HTML Techniques: Text and non-text equivalents for applets and programmatic   objects  HTML Techniques: Graceful transformation of scripts    We ought to add something along the lines of:  Non-W3C Techniques: Flash    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Based on Michael's suggestion, I modified technique 3.2 to read:    Technique 3.2.A [priority 2] Check document for public text identifier  Discussion Status:  awaiting discussion  Evaluation:  The document must contain a valid HTML or XHTML public text identifier if   it is an HTML or XHTML document.  If a text identifier is not the first   line of the document, refuse to evaluate the document.  A <a href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib/catalog">list of public text   identifiers</a> is available from the W3C.  The document is an HTML document if there is an HTML element near the start   of the document and there is an HTML end element as the last non-whitespace   text in the document.  Example Language:  Missing language identifier for this document.  Repair Technique:  Prompt the user for a public text identifier.

      we're due for a face 2 face meeting.  we need to give 8 weeks notice before   a face to face so that people can make travel plans.    could we have suggestions by next wednesday (12 January) for:    1. a city.  chicago is central, but i'm not sure who we could work with to host the   meeting.    Several members of the group are on the East coast, so someplace like   Boston might be more feasible.  Again, I'm not sure who would host, perhaps   MIT/W3C?    I would love to see a meeting in Madison, but I imagine that is wishful   thinking; there are no direct flights (Except from chicago, minneapolis and   milwaukee)  and those adverse to cold may not appreciate the mounds of   snow.  Plus, I'm not sure who could host it (my house isn't quite large   enough).    2. a venue.    3. dates.  the earliest that we could schedule a meeting, assuming that we   wrap up discussion and announce by next Thursday 13 January, is March   9.  note that CSUN is the week of March 20th.  We can not schedule a   meeting immediately after CSUN because other WAI groups have beat us to   it.  We usually don't schedule WAI meetings before CSUN because then it   becomes a full week of meetings (csun + WAI meetings afterwards).    The WAI team discussed possibilities last Tuesday and suggested   April.  Charles will be in Boston in April.    is there another conference that we could piggyback off of?    4. how many days do you suppose we need? one or two?    5. Agenda items. I assume the agenda would be (at the minimum) the   following issues:  1. ERT document.  2. WART.  3. rechartering and future plans (our charters expired last July).    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--        

      Hi all,    I think GL is done debating about what to use as alt-text.  It seems that   we would  rather be encouraging authors to use style sheets for   positioning.  While I agree with this, it is not entirely realistic today   due to the inconsistent support for CSS positioning.  Therefore, I propose   the following for the ERT document:    1.  Images with alt="", alt=" ", and alt=" " (or alt=" ") should   be flagged.    2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., <a   href="home.html"><img src="button.gif" alt=" ">Refer to our home page</a>)   this is o.k.    3.  If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the   image.    3a. If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those   words should not be separated, advise them to use   (or alt=" ")   instead of an image.    3b. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of   the page, advise them to provide a brief descriptive text and suggest that   they may also want to link to a longer description of the image with the   "longdesc" attribute.    Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style   sheets, such as graphical list bullets.  Advise authors to use style   sheets.  (See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document)    3c.  If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text,   advise them to use style sheets or alt=" ".    3d.  If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to   provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary link to a longer   description.    Any further thoughts from GL?  I am also including the last message on this   thread, sent by Jason White on 18 November.  --wendy      >Resent-Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1999 18:20:58 -0500 (EST)  >Date: Thu, 18 Nov 1999 10:20:20 +1100 (EST)  >From: Jason White <jasonw@ariel.ucs.unimelb.EDU.AU>  >To: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>  >Subject: Re: proposal for "null" alt-text (was "Re: GL's   >interpretation   of    null alt-text")  >Resent-From: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >X-Mailing-List: <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org> archive/latest/2549  >X-Loop: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  >Sender: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org  >Resent-Sender: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org  >  >I agree entirely with Nir's position: it is better to advise authors to  >use more appropriate techniques, particularly CSS, than to waste time  >debating the merits of various text equivalents for so-called "spacer  >images".

        New draft of CSS Techniques for WCAG 2.0 available for discussion [1].    I did not add or delete any content, although I added several editorial   notes, reordered a couple of sections, added short names to each technique,   and added tasks to most of the techniques.    History of this draft:  - This summer, Loretta converted the previous draft (published 16 July 2001   [2]) to our techniques dtd.  Our dtd changed since then, so I cleaned up   the xml to conform to our new dtd.  Note that the screen shots (from the   July 2001 draft) did not make it into the new draft.  I also added an   abstract and status that are similar to the HTML Techniques for WCAG 2.0   (published to /TR earlier this month).  - Current WCAG 1.0 draft: CSS Techniques for WCAG 1.0, published 20   September 2000 [3].

To more easily read the data, the user was able to read by   row or column - since these are the appropriate groupings of data.  This is   how tables are read - comparing data between cells.    Please keep in mind that this was created <em>before</em> user agents or   assistive technologies provided this functionality.  Let me emphasize my   point: I used this example to show that client-side scripts had been used   to help make content more accessible due to inadequacies in the UA/AT. It   was not to show that client-side scripting should be done <em>instead</em>   of UA/AT support.    >I'm very surprised that you have the impression that I believe script can  >be made, or would be desirable to have it go away, I am a javascripter by  >profession, I author the comp.lang.javascript FAQ, I do a lot to promote  >javascript use, and to push the boundaries of what can be done, and this  >is one reason why I believe I can comment on this.

I look forward to that.    Now...how did we get onto this tangent from gregg's original message?  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/1048.html    Scenario A: until user agents - blech.  Scenario B: yes, technology-specific implementation info should be at the   technology level.  Scenario C: no, technology-specific support info should not be incorporated   in the Guideline level of the doc.    In regards to the first two not being normative and therefore not making it   to the developer.  I disagree. I thought we had agreed (as recently as 2   weeks ago) that technology-specific checkpoints were to be   normative?  Giving us 2 layers of normative info??    This is where Al's suggestion to scrap Guidelines and preserve and expand   upon success criteria comes in.  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/1052.html    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  /--        

      hello,    the minutes are available at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/minutes/20000403.html    and included below:    04 April 2000 ER WG/IG telecon  Summary of action items and resolutions  Action Wendy: invite amaya folks to ER/AU meeting.  Action: WC generate checklist.  Action: MC go through checklist for Bobby.  Action: CR go through checklist for A-Prompt.  Action: LK go through checklist for WAVE.  Action DB to talk with Heather Swayne to review FrontPage as a testing tool.  Action DB talk with Roger Hill about testing methods used on MSN.  Action WC review a few tools, get Gerald to review HTML Validator.  Action DB take issue to UA - should they be considering ERT techniques in   their guidelines? have they already? include in techniques document?  Resolved: assuming no more comments will release draft publicly this weekend.  Participants  Len Kasday  Chris Ridpath  William Loughborough  Wendy Chisholm  Brian Matheny  Dick Brown  Michael Cooper  Regrets  Gregory Rosmaita  What should we be doing wrt implementations of ERT  LK emphasis is on "we" what should we be doing? already we're working on   ERT and the list of tools.  WC we need to bring ERT techniques into reality.  BM unusual situations for almost all of them.  DB easier for us to do for us.  LK there are lots of authoring tools...  DB but not enough that conform.  LK there are some w3c groups where recommendations are only put out after   there are only one reference implementation of the whole thing.  WL it's being done with SVG, SMIL, CSS, etc.  LK a whole implementation before Rec?  WL have to show it works before you write the book. we're in a similar   boat. my question: which recommendations do our stuff refer to? ATAG?  LK CMN's e-mail considers repair tool a special case of an authoring tool.   in a way LYNX is an accessibility evalution tool. a sighted person can use   w/out speech to get some idea of what will happen. it's not a bad rule of   thumb to use. are there tools that come close to conforming to ATAG?  WL some on AU would say yes. Microsoft is listening and talking, must be   doing something.  DB yes, not sure what. not being ignored.  WL any movement is a step forward. should we investigate if any ERT stuff   being included?  LK we're referenced in the techniques of ATAG, not in Rec itself.  WC work with AU to find out what conforms or not.  LK list of conformance somewhere?  WC generate a checklist of ERT to see who does what.  LK systematic work going on in AU to list what various tools are doing?  WL no.  WC in ATAG techniques, has examples of tools that do x, y, z. by technique   not by tool. techniques for 4.1 - says that amaya is working on it.  Action Wendy: invite amaya folks to ER/AU meeting.  BM HTML and CSS validator are listed on our page.  WC Gerald (maintainer of HTML validator) will be at our face2face.  WL what about MathML? SMIL?  WC an XML validator exists that should cover. not sure if it is public.  LK there is one that exists elsewhere. I will add to tool list.  WC think we should include in the exercise of adding tools to the exisitng   list. create a checklist and check "supported" or "not supported." this   list does not overlap with the tools that AU is evaluating.  MC there are techniques that we have refrained from suggesting, because it   is hard to do.  LK hope we are not. that's a separate issue. let's add them.  WL how far do you go?  MC you could assume a neural net processor.  LK sure, a single sentence. right now, if don't mention OCR on a picture,   we could say, "it is desirable to read the text with OCR." even if we can't   define it. there will be things that we haven't.  WC we need to make a difference which means we need to bring this into   being. find the holes and either find something that fills them or try to   fill them ourselves.  WL have we gone through to determine which exist? possible? unlikely? I   think it is unlikely that something will exist that writes alt-text.  LK there are things that write alt-text for pictures - like the Altifier.   instead of saying "likely or unlikely" i'd prefer to say, "easy or difficult."  WL exists or doesn't exist.  LK needs research or not.  WL huge thing in cognitive world: illustrating text. this will take a tool.  Action: WC generate checklist.  Action: MC go through checklist for Bobby.  Action: CR go through checklist for A-Prompt.  Action: LK go through checklist for WAVE.  LK also need an "other category."  WC yes, by checkpoint here are the techniques, and here's a box for "other   ways to satisfy this checkpoints that we have not thought of." then an   overall "other."  LK Lynx can help you understand how a page looks without JavaScript. it   doesn't say "you've got it."  MC Lynx vs ERT - if author uses Lynx they will know right away if   javascript works. in ERT, we don't address.  LK Lynx or listening to the page with a screen reader are ways to test   usability that are not captured by ERT techniques. when we evaluate the   tools, although we check it off against the checklist, but don't stop   there. look for other things that are missing. not just things that could   be added as a checkpoint, but not part of the ERT paradigm at all.  WC should we add it? could be under "ensure that new technologies tranform   gracefully."  LK we can see when those comments come up, if we should add to ERT or not.   a big "other" category.  WL for example, using a black and white monitor falls under checkpoint 2   (uses of color).  LK this is a little off-topic, looking at something in black and white is   usually not a good technique.  WL it does check if you can use the page w/out color.  WC other people to review tools?  DB front page does some testing. I'll talk with Heather.  Action DB to talk with Heather Swayne to review FrontPage as a testing tool.  DB Roger Hill from MSN is testing the MSN site.  Action DB talk with Roger Hill about testing methods used on MSN.  WL testing techniques as important as testing tools.  LK cynthia brought up interesting points: what happen when try to scale   these to sites with lots of pages (>1,000).  DB there are hundreds of thousands of pages on Microsoft site. MSN also   lots of pages. almost has to be automated at that size.  LK perhaps do a statistical sample and do manual on a few pages.  Action WC review a few tools, get Gerald to review HTML Validator.  LK quick way for tool provider to fill out their own checklist. need a   simple form. encourage people to review their own tools and get included on   our list. gets them thinking about this.  WL therefore, contact Allaire. seems positive.  MC we should continue to list tools, publisher not responded. people may   not respond. some may not feel they need to spend time on. helpful as   service of people we are serving, "here's our brief analysis" then "full   analysis" for people who responded.  WL we can try! "what does your tool do to check for these matters."  MC coordinate with authoring tools.  WC Charles working on relationships with developers: he contacts them then   shows up on their doorstep. the intersection with AU (between the tools   they are investigating and those we have listed) is small. that part needs   to be coordinated. the rest, we need to track down.  WL ERT tools part of other tools rather than stand alone.  LK disagree that the utlimate goal is to get these tools integrated in with   other tools. there is still the need for stand alone tools.  DB you can consider UA's testing tools. in the future they may be doing more.  LK the ideal: techniques part of authoring tools and browsers.  WL can we suggest something to UA for UA's to perform validity checks for   the user?  LK i don't think that has been part of the UA philosophy.  Action DB take issue to UA - should they be considering ERT techniques in   their guidelines? have they already? include in techniques document?  WL if you can be warned that you have the wrong browser because it is going   to be ugly, that would be great.  ERT going public  WC one comment, about null alt-text. need results from survey. working with   kitch barnicle on survey. jason reminded WCAG group. think we can go public   this weekend. put it on this weeks WCAG agenda.  Resolved: assuming no more comments will release draft publicly this weekend.    $Date: 2000/04/03 15:08:50 $ Wendy Chisholm  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

      I added the following tools to the list of existing tools [1] today    1. Clear Language and Effectiveness Tool (CLAD)  2. Dreamweaver 508 Accessibility Suite  3. Reading level calculator  4. Vischeck    I would like to classify these by WCAG 1.0 checkpoint, not just evaluation   or repair.  I have begun a chart with some, but not all.  Anyone want to help?    In other words:  The Reading level calculator and the CLAD help someone determine if they   conform to checkpoint 4.1, whereas the Dreamweaver Accessibility Suite has   checks for checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1,   6.2, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, 9.1, 12.1, 13.6, 14.1 and possibly guidelines 8 and 9   (checking on this). This is per the list at   http://508as.usablenet.com/508AS/1.1/rules    I would like to list for each checkpoint, which tools may be used to help   determine conformance.    --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--

William Loughborough  ?       Len Kasday  ?       Chris Ridpath  ?       Dick Brown  ?       Wendy Chisholm  ?       Brian Matheny  Regrets  ?       Gregory Rosmaita    Need for tools  LK There may be some things that you don't need a tool for. e.g., bring up   a page have an image with red letters on black background and unable to read.  BM Light grey on grey backgrounds, GIF that circulates betwen colors.  WL The tool can be a human.  LK Any browser and a human will do it. Previously, Chuck Opperman described   which order alt and title were displayed (on mouseover).  WL What is title used for? Does the spec say how to render?  WC /* reads from HTML spec. */  LK Perhaps UAAG ought to specify how long to display the tooltip/title?   Allow configuration of length of time.  Action WC and WL to review UAAG working draft last call in the 19 October -   9 November timeframe.  Action LK Review 1 September 2000 UAAG version. Does it refer to tooltip?   If so, is there a way to configure how long it is displayed? If not, send   the group a note.    Testing for alternative pages  LK Keeping track of status of various elements. CMN came up with an   interesting technique. Instead of assigning an ID to the element in the   HTML, you could assign a checksum to the element. Even if people rearrange   the page, in principle you can find out whether the element has been   checked previously.  WL Is there a conceivable non-human intervention way to determine if an   alternative page is equivalent?  LK Let's brainstorm.  WL Playing devil's advocate, say there is not and never will be.  LK But, how far can we get? Are there some tests?  WL Find those things that people have discovered where this messes up. Did   they change the main page and not change alternative page.  LK That's another one of those that is not HTML but is something that needs   to be done.  DB Some alternative pages are merely a different style sheet. The content   is the same.  WL That's not what is meant by this page.  DB It has a different look and we do call it an alternative.  WL If all you change is the presentation, then the situation is a perfect   implementation.  DB It's more or less coming out of a database, takes a couple paths. The   table is unwrapped. Two different pages and two different sets of HTML are   produced.  LK If you are on the server you can see the date of the file. That's a   whole new set of techniques for the document.  DB You could be looking at the data on the server. The data is identical   between them. But are people getting the same meaning out of these two pages?  WL That's b/c we've been looking at "lookers" for so long.  LK If I took 2 paragraphs and swapped them, the UNIX algorithm is not smart   enough to figure that out.  DB Right.  WC CVS is a bit smarter about this.  LK Smart enough to pick up if two lines are swapped? e.g., two lines of C++   code.  Action WC: Is CVS smart enough to pick up that two lines have been switched?  WL We are concerned about alt pages being up to date.  WC And making sure the data is there.  LK Edapta's specialty is to make different versions of pages.  WL Because of abuse, we have discouraged it.  LK In addition to accomodating people with old screen readers, are there   other variations of the MSN home page? e.g. for palm size?  DB You can sign up for the mobile web, that's different. They also figured   that page would be better for people with cognitive disabilities since the   main page is so overwhelming.  WL They are moving in the direction of a place where you can get at the   semantics without depending on a particular browser.  LK I'm looking at the home page. You won't find a link to it yet. You can   get to it from the accessibility site. Cynthia was still working on the   personalization page when she left. Comparing the text would do it.  WL The way to make sure that the alt page is equivalent is to test the   semantics.  WC e.g., as long as it's captured in RDF.  WL right.  WC What about now? How determine that have the same info on both pages? On   one may have IMG w/alt, on other have text. Looking for the text of the alt   may not help if they have expanded on the alt page.  LK If have a user profile, then the person gets a page adapted to them   (this is the Edapta philosophy).  WL Not even just for disability, but like CC/PP, what I want to be bothered   with not just what I want to reveal about myself. Then the user agent can   be more active.  Action LK: post message to list to ask Kynn to describe the philosophy.  LK It's more than the browser, it's the server providing in various formats.  WL For our purposes, we need to find out what it is about alt. pages that   makes them seem like a ghetto to the person for whom it feels like a ghetto.  WC Don't we know that's it date and lack of content?  WL I don't know. I don't ever use them.  LK When I asked about, I got a few responses. E.g., a parent is looking at   a page with their child or with her friends and talking about a page. It's   not just the facts, it's the layout and other features.  WC What info do we need to do to move forward?  WL When someone asks, "what's wrong with an alt-page" we can say, here's   what's wrong with.  Action WL and GR: write the definitive paper on the cyber-ghetto. Why it   matters and how it matters.  WC Then we can figure out what we're testing for?  WL Right.  LK On the algorithm side, any more ideas?  /* none */  Resolved: Checking for equivalent alternative pages is still an open issue.    Proper use of headings  LK How many H1s can there be? Can there be only 1?  WL It is suspicious.  CR Depends on the text. If > 100 words, not a heading. If 5, most likely a   heading.  WL Even if only 5, could be heading.  CR Can have multiple h2 or h3 why not have more than one h1?  WL Not that you can't, but it is suspect.  LK The browsers relegate titles to a strip. It does not give you that   visual punch. If you take that philosophy, the real title is the real title   of the page it should not be h1, but regular text with css.  WL You won't have success with. The open issue is, should we delete the   check "only one h1." Doesn't matter to accessibility. It mattters that we   structure things.  WC Where does this come from? Not in HTML spec. Any user agent or AT use H1   in a special way?  WL It's because of authors abusing.  WC But can't you check if it is nested correctly? H1 H2 H3 H2 H3 H1 H2...  WL I am in favor of deleting.  LK But, you say it is suspicious.  WL Strike it.  CR I agree.  LK What does WCAG say?  WC /* reads from WCAG: 3.5 Use header elements to convey document structure   and use them according to specification. [Priority 2] For example, in HTML,   use H2 to indicate a subsection of H1. Do not use headers for font effects. */  WL That's good enough.  WC Favors deleting as well.  DB also favors  CR Already removed.  Resolved: We don't need to check that there is only one H1 per page. This   issue is closed. The technique has already been removed from the AERT.    Scripts  WC Talked with Raman last week about a client-side proxy to evaluate   JavaScript. Primarily for browsers that don't support javascript.  WL Reading about XForms. Allows you to get forms done without scripting.  LK Talking about validation?  WL Yes, which you allow and etc.  LK How about when have choice ABCD and other. Other is a text field, only   valid if you check other. Until then it is greyed out (like GUI interface).   Will they be looking at this?  WL Not sure. Look at "Requirements for XForms."  LK Back to scripting: Mouseovers. When are they an accessibility problem   and when are they not a problem. Just decoration, no problem, but popping   up text is a problem.  CR For every single mouseover, just put in an onfocus. This should be required.  WL Yes, that's what matters.  CR Not a big deal to put it in.  WC There was an issue with onfocus in that the result was active forever   after the focus. Had to pair that with onlosefocus.  LK issue also with physical disabilities? increase access time?  CR no, same as onmouseover.  LK There are cases where can't simply have onfocus which is same as   mouseover. e.g., if you have a page with text fields, one has focus,   someplace else has a menu. when you click that if another place where click   w/mouse that populates field.  WC Not accessible to have focus in more than one spot.  LK There are 4 cursors in jaws.  WC Don't understand what you're saying. Does not sound accessible or user.  LK Sure, in Eudora you can start an e-mail message, then go to address book   and click on an address that you want inserted into the new message. That   argues for separate control. We need to think in terms of having an   interface where you can do things as equivalent of mouse without changing   text focus.  Action LK: Continue discussion of javascript and onfocus/onmouseover on the   list.  Resolved: The issue with scripts is still open.    Next meeting  LK Joint meeting with AU next week.  WL A lot of us will be in Bristol.  Action LK and WC: coordinate with Jutta and CMN re: joint AU/ER meeting   next week.

Rosmaita, GJR (scribe)  Regrets  Daniel Dardallier, DD  AGENDA ITEM 1: AGENDA FOR F2F  WC: talking to people; as of Friday, have 14 people registered for Fri/ 13   for Thursday; includes some new people; found out UsableNet URI and tool --   both developers will be at meeting (from Italy); contacted everyone on list   of existing tools; heard back from a few with conflicts; people commenting   that project interesting; Rick Jelliffe could participate via phone, but   not physically -- what do you think about that?  LK: would be great if can take care of logistics  WC: also said would send a position paper if that would help; will follow   up; Authoring Tool People: CMN, Jan,  DB: I'm not coming, but Cynthia Shelly is  WC: Marjolein Katsma from Allaire, maybe someone from Adobe  LK: what about the Edapta people; met president Jack Berkowitz at a meeting   last week -- interested in joining ER, going to ask him to join; have a   tool that presents web site in different formats: most abstract info in   XML, style into different forms; other extreme ordinary visually oriented   HTML page, with additional stuff to accommodate browsers  // Action LK: ping Edapta about participation in ER //  HB: not attempting to adapt itself via browser sniffing?  LK: no; uses data profiles;  // DD joins momentarily to hold phone for WC //  GJR: what kind of data profiles? CC/PP or rolling their own  LK: not sure, Kynn Bartlett, formerly of HTML Writers' Guild (HWG) involved  GJR: with Kynn Bartlett there, probably at least investigating CC/PP, as   that is one of his special interests  LK: Daniel, talking about whom we have invited outside group to participate   in F2F  // WC rejoins, DD leaves //  WC: hope more people registered over weekend;  LK: any additional agenda item suggestions? last week took agenda from web   site and made one major change--in the pre- lunch timeslot put in   strategizing and planning, and added 15 minutes after lunch to debrief   group with thoughts and ideas that came up during individual lunchtime   discussions  WC: Charles McN suggested talk about charter; don't think necessary; think   agenda y'all came up with last week ok; on Friday, a lot of discussion of   how AU and ER will work together  LK: Thursday conversation involves charter issues even if not charter   discussion per se  AGENDA ITEM 2: ER CHARTER  LK: has everyone access to charter? if not, can read as I go  [Scribe's Note: Proposed ER Charter can be found at:   <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter.html#mission>]  // LK will read as he goes //  WC: Charles MCN had some issues I haven't had time to add to draft  LK: key aspects of this is the mission and deliverables, especially in   terms of preparing for F2F--let me review the Mission Statement now: The   mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is:  to document techniques for creating Evaluation and Repair Tools;  to find tools that implement the techniques and where there are none,   prototype or participate in the development of an implementation;  to assess the implementation of these techniques in evaluation and repair   tools;  to provide a discussion forum to review and collaborate on tool development.  // Brian Metheny (BM) joins //  GJR: are we doing away with the IG?  WC: yes; authoring tools WG and WCAG and UA all provide function of what   was defined in interest group; need to focus on creating tools and causing   them to come into being; part of that is forum for developers; encouraging   people to implement ideas and share ideas and implementation strategies  GJR: don't' disagree with strategy, but think that the ER activity's proper   purview is developing tools, not theorizing about them; consciousness   raising is EO's purview  LK: if charter goes through, what sorts of messages would we see in   archives one year from now?  WC: personally, hope to see more discussion of techniques, as when we went   through techniques to push AERT out the door; want to see people talk about   tools--I'm developing this tool, this is what I'm checking for, this is   what I found, this is how I repair; someone else says, I do it this way,   someone else says I took X and Y and then integrated it into tool Z; want   to try to cross-fertilize commercial developers participating in AU WG with   our ideas  LK: when people discuss techniques, how deep into implementation will they   go? high level of abstraction, or greater? Perl allows you just to get the   <HEAD> of an HTML document, so could use Perl script to grab the TITLE of a   page to which a graphical hyperlink without ALT text points  WC: can have a variety; continue to find questions to send back to WCAG or   UA WG  GJR: again, I don't disagree with strategy, but think that the ER   activity's proper purview is developing tools, not theorizing about them,   take strategies outlined by IG and other guidelines documents and implement   them as proxies to find out (a) what works, (b) for whom, (c) under what   circumstances, and then we can (1) take that empirical evidence to   developers and ask for implementations, and, equally as important in my   mind, keep the proxies available for those who don't have access to the   latest and greatest software and hardware  LK: when we talk about "we", who are we talking about? in terms of talking   about developing techniques; the way the group works now, is that there are   several people who happen to be part of this group that develop these types   of tools; don't have a group activity other than ERT or guidelines  GJR: like to see us go further down the path of Tablin, the report tool, etc.  WC: how do you see that playing out practically?  GJR: to make most difference in the real world for actual users, we need to   test ideas, rather than formulate them; there may still be a need for an IG   and a WG--IG formulates techniques, based on other WAI WG GLs, then WG   implements them in a variety of ways, as proxies; then we can say to the   WAI-IG list and the world in general, here are 4 implementations, try them   via these proxies, and let us know which worked best for you and why, and   what equipment you were using when you used them; then we build up   empirical evidence AND make the tools/repair functionalities available to   ALL users; UA WG shying away from repair functionality, so we need to (A)   pick up their slack as regards the repair function of user agents, even if   only by proxy or plugin, and (B) show implementers the way to add   evaluation and repair functionality to AU tools WC: then all we have to   document is what works, rather than theorize and then wait to see what   works--I like that development cycle better than the present  CR: working in that direction now; problem is logistics-- many techniques   not in tool due to either shortage of people to work on them, or complexity   of issues involved  GJR: not denigrating current work, but pointing way forward that will   expedite our work and provide tools for people to use today, and which   actually repair on the fly, rather than limit our work to helping authors   as they create pages  WC: to do group activity, have group use particular programming language   and platform to assign action items and move forward  GJR: one thing we should concentrate upon is getting ER functionalities   into Amaya, since that is test bed client for W3C; we need to liaison with   them, and, probably, given their logistical limitations, do some of the   work for them, or get some of Daniel's students to work on putting ER   functionalities into Amaya  WC: what about CAST and A-Prompt people? what do you want out of the ER   group? would you be ok if we worked with Amaya?  CR: from my perspective it would be OK; ATRC wants to get A- Prompt   integrated into as many tools as possible, including Amaya  HB: would you want to do part of integration yourself  CR: would help with integration as much as possible; optimally working with   someone on Amaya team,  WC: is A-Prompt open source?  CR: going to be  WC: Amaya is written in C, but uses different libraries for different   platforms. so I believe that there is, essentially, a totally different   code base for each platform;; code is currently a mess, as GJR said, due   not to the efforts of the Amaya team, but because a lot of it was hacked up   for someone's Ph.D. dissertation or MS thesis; Amaya does some interesting   things; created a language to create graphical layout through libraries,   which sounds like the XUL idea to me;  LK: how Windows-specific is A-Prompt?  CR: right now, it is only available for Windows--basically, A-Prompt is a   Windows DLL that is called by another program  WC: could easily integrate with Windows version of Amaya  LK: that fist into the spirit of prototypes; if works in Windows, then   figure out how to make work on other platforms  WC: how close or realistic is A-Prompt becoming open source?  CR: details have to be worked out; problem is that the project received   funding from a number of sources, need to check with all of those sources   to find out if any intellectual property rights claims are attached to any   of them; if make A-Prompt open source, then could get a lot more people   working on it, so I personally support making it open source  WC: if can resolve open source question before F2F, that would be a major   piece of planning and strategy  CR: I'll look into it this week; Michael and Brian, please do the same at CAST  // ACTION CR: investigate A-Prompt's status vis a vis open source //  // ACTION MC/BM: investigate CAST's plans for making Bobby open source //  LK: even though it is implemented as a Windows DLL, to what extent does   A-Prompt separate logic from repair?  CR: evaluation very portable; problem is how we "tokenize" HTML object;   we've been talking with CAST about using Java; but that is probably the   longer term solution-- need to stick to Windows now, so that we can deliver   a robust and functional tool  LK: rule interpreter should have nothing to do with user interface  CR: rules implemented in code; isn't Bobby starting to implement rule base   using XML?  MC: XML document not driving rules now, just providing language that gets   pulled into report; planning on moving Bobby version 4 in that direction;   I've actually been doing a lot of work on that, and it is a lot more   complicated than it sounds  LK: sounds complicated to me!  WC: me too; we need an ERT need a schema, sort of like Schematron, but is   the problem that not everything can be done logically? let me step back a   bit--how many people familiar with RDF and Schemas?  LK: cursory idea of it; know XML and RDF conceptually  DB: have conceptual grasp, too  HB: know XML  MC: dream in XML but only know basics of RDF; looked at Schematron -- like   ideas, but question is how much can be expressed logically in language   used; there are some things that Schematron couldn't do that Bobby does   very easily; why? my theory is that Schematron tries to use a meta language   to abstract techniques--mentally, I've been thinking how far CAST could go   down that path; need to think of ways of extending abstraction; RDF and   Schemas relate to document, but for things that can't be expressed in terms   of HTML structure--I can't see how would be addressable using Schemas or RDF  LK: like what?  MC: use clear and simple language; use consistent navigation- -if structure   not consistent from page to page, for example, but the author uses   consistent navigation, mechanisms, that may be problematic for a   Schematron-type tool to deal with  WC: MC, would you post some examples and some thoughts as to how one to   might express stuff like that to the list?  // Action MC: send example to list of what Bobby can do easily that   Schematron can't do, as well as ideas for relating RDF and Schemas to those   things that can't be expressed in terms of HTML structure //  WC: need to keep momentum; need to educate ourselves in some of the   languages; could take time at F2F or telecon to do a half-hour presentation   on a language or format and how it might work, what limitations are, etc.  // GJR suspends minuting due to PC problems;  // LK minutes while GJR's computer fritzes //  cr: you mean suggesting another form for ert  wc: no,not rewrite ert, but lets all have same language, xml, rdf? I'll   investigate. michael said rdf not enough  lk: no just schematron  mc: rdf and schemas are structurally based. work well with structure of   doc, like presence of alt, but can't express other stuff  lk: like what  mc: use clear language, use consistent navigation... structure not   consistent even if navigation is  wc what about fuzzy logic? to combine test results, different opinions?   fuzzy consensus  db: what's question?  mc: problems: structure, can express in rdf. but other issues, like   determining language, no pattern to match. but can use fuzzy logic. can run   number of tests and combine to come up with one answer. is that something   we want to investigate? educate us? develop technique for it. How to express?  db: tricky area even though similar things are done. can refer to those   that are available. but so much more in web pages. very tricky.  wc: must first define problem. are several methods to determine reading   level rating... syllables, words used, words in sentence... mostly   straightforward  mc: concern is how valid is the rating  wc: educators have different levels. but can combine in answer. but not   just one of tests.  db: checkpoint about languge is not main point. usability with assitive   technology, tables, style sheets causing most problems. I think this   doesn't need as much work.  gregory: can do screenscrape and analyze  mc: but do people want that? there are lots of lynx me services .  gregory: usability belongs more properly in eo. may have someone who can   help with ai and fuzzy logic.  wc: we should be looking at harder issues. ai, fuzzy logic, if they can   help lets use. we've been avoiding hard things. maybe expert system,  db: seem straightforward but no tools that can help. can be hard to do.  gregory: so use proxies to get feedback.  wc: e.g. low hanging fruit... implement to show how to do. do easy things   first. where to begin?  mc: that's why atrc and cast have just started doing things simply and   well. Then move on. do easy things first. helps to focus and know you are   getting somewhere.  wc: have you filled checklist for bobby  mc: not yet  wc: do it. will help set priorities.  // GJR resumes minuting in earnest //  WC: should be looking at higher end issues, yes--if can do with "fuzzy   logic" or AI, or whatever  DB: some things seem straightforward, but not easily tested  WC: need to go through P1 checkpoints, find out what has been implement,   and what hasn't--CR did you post a note alerting the group that the   checklist has been posted?  CR: yes  // LK, GJR seen it //  [Scribe's Note: The AERT Checklist can be found at:   <http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert10-chklist.html>]  WC: where do we start?  MC: CAST is concentrating upon doing what we can do simply and do well,   once we've done that, we plan on moving on to address the harder issues;   there are many things that Bobby could do, but we felt that we need to do   the easy things first; helps to focus things to know you are getting   somewhere and have a tool that actually does something  WC: have you filled out the ERT checklist for Bobby?  MC: can, but haven't submitted it  WC: please do; the more people/developers who fill out the checklist, the   quicker and more accurately we can set priorities as to where do we go from   here? need to concretely go through checklist and fill up holes; have   people submit ideas and move forward; need to assign action items  CR: are you going to look at the ATRC document in a prose format to look at   evaluation without having to understand technology? advantage to having   prose is that one need not be fluent with the technology to understand the   problems  LK: we're not saying "change it" WC: right--we want to fill in gaps and see   things implemented  CR: are there any programmers here with time on their hands that could help   with coding for A-Prompt  WC: ME!!! I'm ready to do coding big time--send me something to chew on  CR: will do  // ACTION CR: send WC something to chew on //  LK: I have long list of functionalities to add to WAVE  WC: Daniel has students coming to work over the summer, but need to give   them something to work on; CMN could be liaison between us and Amaya  // ACTION LK: put feature into WAVE that will allow someone to look at   source to see if what appears to be a list is a list; add logical tags so   that if there is a numerical list outputs an icon //  WC: favorite feature of HoTMetaL is graphical tag view  LK: Composer has it too--tag symbol with name of tags; in spirit of making   accessible to HTML-aware people, use specific tags to represent specific   elements  // DB leaves //  LK: want to beef up WAVE for F2F  GJR: would like to work with LK on making output generated by CSS   pseudo-elements rather than icons  // WC experiences phone problems; her phone may die soon //  WC: other agenda items?  LK: there is an "if time" agenda item dealing with the Minimum Requirements   for WCAG 2.0 document, but I'd prefer to keep focus on ER right now  WC: at WCAG F2F people said checkpoints need to be easily verifiable  LK: would remove word "easily"--if hard to do, that's the way the cookie   crumbles  WC: ok--clear is a better word  LK: right--goal is that 2 people can look at page and unambiguously say   passes or doesn't  WC: if WCAG can do that, it would be a huge win  LK: comments in regards guidelines is making them precise enough  LK: any other issues? there's no law that says we have to go to 11:30  WC: I'm fine with ending  CR: are we meeting next week?  LK: good question--let's see; we may have last minute things to discuss  WC: at least report on action items  LK: exchange notes on who is coming and not; action item updates  WC: date next Monday--the eighth -- day registration closes  LK: how public is access to registration list?

Participants  Jason White  Charles McCathieNevile  Dick Brown  Wendy Chisholm  Gregory Rosmaita  Tim Noonan  Andi Snow-Weaver  Cynthia Shelley  Agenda  Checklists and work items arising from last week's meeting.  Open issues in the Techniques document modules.  Harmonization of guidelines concerned with accessibility, device   independence (mobile computing etc.), and internationalization--preliminary   discussion.  JW not only issues with techniques, but how to track issues.  GR I have XHTML checks to add to WC's draft, but they are trapped in my out   box.  Technology-specific checkpoints  Refer to http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/05/wcag-techs.html  JW This document shows that the approach we discussed last week is a good one.  WC at WWW9 authoring for mobile computing was a major theme. There is the   need for an authoring philosophy and authoring tools so that authors don't   go insane trying to create content for everyone. People want to derive   multiple presentations from one source.  JW also Internationalization group. do they have guidelines?  GR one of the other issues at www9 was the intersection of accessibility,   usability and internationalization. There was a guy at Helen Petrie's   workshop on Monday that said that an issue that many authoring tools that   output Japanese use HTML 3.2. They also used summarizers for content on   mobile phones. There is a convergence with mobile.  JW And the relationship between mobile, accessibility, and   internationalization should become stronger as these continue to converge.   The accessibility community has an important role here. We can contribute   to the common understanding of how one can author to meet these various   requirements. The process of abstraction could be a benefit as it might   identify authoring strategies that meet these various needs. This also gets   at the processing model I discussed in my e-mail from yesterday. One could   group techniques per technology and bring together those technologies that   will be used in combination, e.g. HTML and CSS, or XML and XSL. The process   of transformation is under user control either by virtue of the user having   a style sheet and receiving the markup on the client and applying the   cascade or a transforming proxy server. The overriding principal is that   the content must be formatted or transformed to meet the requirements of   the user and the device the user is employing. One role for the guidelines   could be to specify the processing requirements - from source to destination.  GR are you suggesting a processing module or process and interoperable?  JW something along those lines. there would be a general understanding of   the way in which the material can be processed to meet access requirements   as well as other requirements. Source content with semantics in the markup   that gets transformed into formatted output. It might go through   intermediaries (FO's), but regardless of how done it is under the user's   control.  WC so how move forward?  JW think it would be at the guidelines level.  WC do you want to draft something?  @@JW draft a comment about how the technologies fit together.  JW you had tried to apply checkpoints to every technology when in fact some   are complimentary.  WC any way to create general principles instead of documenting all   permutations?  CMN I would like to continue the exercise of generalizing the guidelines.  JW GV is working on. Also, last week we discussed 3 levels of information.   High level guidance, technology-specific checkpoints, then   technology-specific techniques.  WC next steps then? should i continue working on other checkpoints? The   generalized checkpoints worked very well.  JW yes.  WC other technologies? MathML?  CMN would like to. Try to work with Marja.  @@CMN and MK checkpoints for MathML.  WC interested in DOM.  JW anyone want to attempt DOM?  CMN way you would use DOM in languages, like SVG-animation.  JW there are some that pertain to user interfaces, perhaps those should be   considered in relation to DOM and Forms.  WC scripting and changing the DOM.  JW if there is a client-side programming languge, and manipulating document   content, the same requirements apply to applets. By the way, we need to   work on our terminology to distinguish the 3 levels effectively.  GR I'm not sure what we're doing breaking out into technology-specific   modules. You can't use XML without XSL. Should we demonstrate the   technologies rather than hard and fast modularization. I tried to be as   forward and backwards looking as possible. We can't deal with these in   isolation.  CMN one approach in ATAG-TECHS we have some techniques that are specific to   a language or a type of tool others are very general. It gets to the point   that to manage it we need to look at the underlying structure of the document.  JW yes, that's what we're trying to achieve here as well. It is important   to have a concept of how the content will be processed after it is created.   Some techniques will cover a range of technologies others will be very   specific to one or another. I thoughts that's what we were moving to aim   towards.  GR It seems impossible to discuss HTML without discussing style sheets.  CMN that's jason's proposal.  JW yes, that would be a serious mistake. we have to discuss them in   combination. other issues with checklist?  Issue tracking  WC summarizes issues with issue tracking.  @@JW take issues of ETA to WAI-CG  GR also take mailing list archive.  CMN that is being dealt with next week.  TN and registration process.  CMN that will come later. there is an issue with resources.  @@WC ask Jon Gunderson about UA - can we install it and use it?  CMN has anyone used bugzilla? developed as part of mozilla project. redhat   uses it as a way to keep track of stuff in their systems. not sure if it is   accessible.  TN i had an outstanding action item to review Techniques navigation and it   looks much better.  WC I would like people to check out bugzilla.  @@JW, GR, WC check out bugzilla as potential issue tracking tool.  @@JW search for other issue tracking tools.  WC What do other companies use?  CS proprietary.  DB there are some commercial products.  CMN history behind ETA is that we wanted an issue tracking system. Decided   that none of the available software was very great.  DB does Linux ship with something?  CMN might be bugzilla.  JW when we set up a system do we try to compile a list of oustanding issues   or start from scratch and ask people to submit new issues.  WC there are 17 open issues for techniques, most of them are still very   open. issues for guidelines are mostly dealth with.  JW can we close some of them on the list.  WC sounds good. also need to address cognitive and learning disabilities.  JW we will have a teleconference devoted just to this topic. we are working   on scheduling that.  CS Another issue that I would like to address, "What are the minimum   requirements for browsers?"  JW earlier we addressed the issue of device-independent guidelines and   relation to mobile, I18N, etc. That is an interesting place to address   those assumptions. To ask those other communities their thoughts.  CS Another piece of it is the prohibition against scripting.  WC no prohibition.  CS there are instances where it takes a lot of work and duplication of work   to make scripts accessible on script-capable and script-incapable browsers.  CMN this gets to Greg Gay's point. We should figure out what is the thing   that we believe is out there as the deployed browser and make that   explicit. Then we can say, "this is why we do or don't say provide a   substitute for forms." There was a time when forms were not readable and we   needed to supply a phone number.  CS the other problem is the "until user agents" clause. How many user   agents have to for this to be satisfied.  CMN yep.  CS JW, your point about goals of the guidelines, perhaps i haven't read the   introductory material, I don't think all of the assumptions have been stated.  JW it says, "this is inteded to make content as broadly accessible as   possible. focusing on people with disabilities, but there is a secondary   goal for making the guidelines applicable for authoring for a variety of   devices."  @@WC send issues from techniques doc open issues to the list.    $Date: 2000/06/01 21:19:45 $ Wendy Chisholm  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  madison, wi usa  tel: +1 608 663 6346  /--

To provide authors the first step to get over the hump, in the excerpt the   first step in writing a description of a figure is:  Ask yourself, "Why is it there? What does it illustrate or add to the   text?" Stress these points and avoid inconsequential details.    The excerpt begins with general guidance and becomes more specific to the   different types of visual information.

      Hello all,    I don't know if this is too basic, but here are some initial thoughts. I   looked through the RDF tutorials and primers and "RDF for dummies" but they   all jumped right into techno-jargon.  I was trying to bring it to a level   that a wider audience could understand, but I might have been aiming too   wide.  Let me know.    <basic-intro>  When we speak with someone we agree on which language we will use to   communicate.  I am an American who knows 10 words of Japanese.  When I   travel to Tokyo I have to find people who speak English in order to   communicate.    Luckily, context helps constrain the concepts that we might need to   discuss.  For example, at the grocery store we are primarily talking about   prices.  We can use a digital display of the number (at the cash register   or on a calculator) to agree that we are both talking about the same number.    Therefore, depending on context, the words and concepts that you have to   choose from will change.    When machines communicate, they also must agree on which language to use   and that the concepts mean the same thing for each of them.  With EARL we   are creating a language for machines to talk with each other about the   qualities of Web content or of an authoring tool or a user agent.    EARL allows someone to describe how well Web content or a tool follows   guidelines or specifications.  For example, using EARL you can describe if   a particular image is used in an accessible way on a Web page.  Or if a   user agent displays SVG images properly.  "Properly" is defined by the SVG   specification.  "Accessible" is defined in WCAG.    When we speak to each other, our words are used in an order that has been   defined in the grammar that we use.  In English, our basic sentence   structure is "noun verb object."  For example, "the dog howled at the moon."    We can create sentences that are much more complicated but we can boil them   down to noun/verb/object.  For example, we describe more about the dog and   how it howled and what the moon looked like and why the dog howled, but the   basic structure is the same; "The cute Siberian husky named Iko howled   deeply at the full moon last Thursday when his owner forget to feed him   dinner."    In EARL, we also deal with triples.  They are similar to a noun/verb/object   triple, but instead we call them subject/predicate/object.    </basic-intro>    I could then get into reification (e.g., the more complex "dog howled at   the moon" example - how each piece could contain more info) and then get   into code examples and describe how the pieces fit together.  Start w/basic   statements (like the ones generated by Sean's bookmarklet) and get into   more complex ones (like the n3 examples).    Thoughts?  --wendy  --  wendy a chisholm  world wide web consortium  web accessibility initiative  seattle, wa usa  tel: +1 206.706.5263  /--        

        Steven,    Looking on the WAI lists, I see a variety of responses, particularly in the   thread started by Aaron Leavanthal on 24 April 2001. [1]    For example:  Gregory Rosmaita thinks it should be user configurable. [2]  Masafumi Nakane thinks we should take a conservative approach and *not*   activate. [3]  Kelly Ford makes a distinction between a button (activate) and a link   (focus). [4]    I would ask the UAWG.  They have a variety of test suites for accesskey   [5,6] and UA behavior is the primary topic of UAAG.    --wendy    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0241.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999OctDec/0725.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0274.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001AprJun/0253.html  [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/cp0101/0101-ACCESSKEY.html  [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/  At 10:52 AM 9/27/02, Steven Pemberton wrote:    >Editing the XHTML 2 spec, I came across something I wasn't sure of.  >  >If an access key is on a link, should the access key take you to the link,  >where you must then activate the link (with return or space or whatever), or  >should it immediately follow the link.  >  >HTML 4 says follow the link, but I note that UAs aren't consistent here.
