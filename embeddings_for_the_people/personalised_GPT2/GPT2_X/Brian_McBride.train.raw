      Ha!  I think PatrickS was right :)    The test case Jeremy presents can be made deterministic.    The problem is that the XML spec says that the order of the attributes is   not significant.  But we can define an ordering to determine in what order   to add the statements to the bag, e.g. we could say sort the attributes by   their qnames and insert in that order.  It would take a little more than   that to precisely define the ordering, but you get the idea.  This is   sufficient to order them since they attribute names must be unique.    Two questions:       o does it work?       o is it worth it, or do we just accept the non-determinism.    Anyway, it seems like syntax issue, not a MT one.

It is not your fault.  I had doubts about going to 2nd last call without   a complete review of the semantics doc.  I suppressed them, which in   hindsight was a mistake.    That is life.  The world is not a perfect place, and one of the things   I'm learning is just how hard it is, even for very clever people, to get   things like proofs right.  I forget what it was like programming in   languages that didn't do a lot of checking of the program at compile   time.  This seems like writing in machine code without even a machine to   test the code on - all one has is testing by inspection.

I think we have to assess how to react to this little problemette.    I think we make life more difficult for ourselves, not easier, if we try   to rush things through before we are really ready.  We should ask   ourselves whether we still believe we are ready for lc2.    On the one hand:       - the proofs are informative - they are there to convince ourselves,   and others, that the claims we make are justified, e.g. with respect to   the relationship between the entailment rules and the MT.       - thus W3C process allows for them to be corrected during last call   without forcing another last call, provided its just the proof thats   wrong, not the conclusions.    On the other hand:       - there are bugs in the proofs - we are not done on the semantics   document and we have not yet addressed all our issues with it.  The   latest message from Peter suggests we are not done discussing this yet.     By that critereon, semantics is not ready for 2nd last call.    Options:    - go ahead with the second last call announcement    - hold off the second last call announcement till we have sorted the   problems with semantics (how?).    - go ahead with all except semantics?    Brian

      Hi Aaron,    Thanks for this Aaron.  I will of course include a pointer to your draft on the  issues list - I should have done that before, and we should regard this issue as  'active' at the moment.    Reading the original mail mesage that raised the issue, the reason why an RDF  mime type is thought to  be required is to support content negotiation.  Do you  believe that this is the only motivation, or are there others that we should  capture?  The current characterization of the issue in the IL document isn't  very clear.  Would you be able to write some words describing the problem that  could be included there?    How closely related do you feel the #rdfms-fragments issue is to this one.   Should they be merged and treated as one?    The points that Frank has raised are substantive; I'm not sure that the  rdfms-assertion issue is going to be easy to deal with.  For example, you say  that the 'sender' is asserting any RDF statements 'sent' to be true.  Who is the  sender, e.g. in the case of RDF embedded in your home page?  Your isp?  When  this issue was raised at the rdf-interest f2f, there was a suggestion that such  assertions should have consequences in law, e.g. if they are libelous - how does  one determine exactly what has been said in a way that will work in court?   These are deep waters.  What do you think of following Frank's suggestion and  separating the mime-type issue from the assertion issue?    On a more general note, are there any other pre-cooked proposals for dealing  with any of the issues that anyone is aware of.

      Tim,    The RDFCore WG seeks your help with an RDF issue, rdfms-assertion:       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-assertion    [[  Summary: RDF is not just a data model. The RDF specs should define a   semantics so that an RDF statement on the web is interpreted as an   assertion of that statement such that its author would be responsible in   law as if it had been published in, say, a newspaper.  ]]    The WG believes that this issue originates with you.    I would like to clearly establish what it is that you would like from us.    A number of concerns have been raised about this issue:       o RDF is just one of several specifications that are 'in play' when an   RDF statement is retrieved from the web.  What is the minimum the RDF specs   must say to achieve the effect that you want.       o Whilst the RDF specs might say what a statement means, that meaning   might be modified by its context.  For example, what about an RDF graph   entitled "Myths about Namespaces".  Would the publisher of that graph be   asserting the statements therin?       o Some on the WG do not believe that the WG is empowered to make law;   that is a matter for the lawyers, governments, parliaments and the like of   the many countries of the world. Different countries may make different laws.       o Do you expect us to define exactly what an RDF statement means?        _:b <rdf:type> <foo:Liar> .      _:b <foo:email> <mailto:bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com> .    What chain of evidence would be required to prove that this is  a   derogatory statement about me.    The current model theory WD       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/    in section 1.3 states:         [[Asserting an RDF graph amounts to claiming that it is true, which is   another way of saying that the world it describes is, in fact, so arranged   as to be an interpretation which makes it true.     ]]    Is this sufficient to meet your needs?  Other means would be needed to   establish that a statement was about the world we live in and that it was   being asserted.  It seems that such claims could only be established from   the context in which the statement was used.    The RDFCore WG has discussed other possible statements that it might   make.  The following text, which might be included in the primer,  was   suggested for discussion:    [[  Assertions made in RDF are analogous to assertions made in any other   language. The author and/or publisher of these assertions is responsible   for these assertions. It remains the responsibility of courts to determine   legal responsibility considering the effects of context and other factors.  ]]    Brian McBride  RDFCore co-chair        

        Checking the semantics doc I find    [[  This has been re-done somewhat as a result of email correspondence. The   situation now is somewhat subtle. The actual conditions are stated as part   of the rdf and rdfs semantics simply as conditions on XML literals   considered as a syntactic category. This is what the comment was concerned   with. Now, however, in D-interpretations, the 'built-in datatype' is   introduced explicitly as an entity, and some text added here to clarify the   importance of this for OWL-type reasoners. This allows non-datatype-savvy   engines to use the XML syntax and also allows more sophisticated reasoners   to build on D-interpretations.  ]]    We have an issue we are moving from not accept to accept and that require   WG review.    Best I can figure here is that Peter was making a subtle point of formal   semantics.  My vague understanding is (paraphrasing what Pat says above):      - previously the semantics of xml literals were specified as semantic   conditions in the RDF and RDFS semantics      - there was a subtle problem (that escapes me) with making it clear that   a datatype processor could really treat it like a datatype      - this is fixed in the current ed's draft by making the built in data   explicitly present in (all?) datatype interpretations and adding some   clarifying text:    [[  The semantic conditions for rdf interpretations impose the correct   interpretation on literals typed by 'rdf:XMLLiteral'. However, a   D-interpretation recognizes the datatype to exist as an entity, rather than   simply being a semantic condition imposed on the RDF typed literal syntax.   Semantic extensions which can express identity conditions on resources   could therefore draw stronger conclusions from D-interpretations than from   rdfs interpretations.  ]]    Seeing nothing I disagree with I invite Pat to propose the WG:      - reopen pfps-08    - accept pfps-08    - approve the approach Pat has taken and this modified text    Brian

It doesn't add any normative value.  The point has already been made in the   previous sentence, but it does potentially open a whole new can of   worms.

      Sergey,    Thanks for completing the action.  Now how does this affect our work plan?    It is clear from the responses that there is a preference for prioritizing   our technical discussions on the model and abstract syntax.  Whilst these   should be our priority, those who wish to, can still make progress with other  issues.    We should review the issue list and give priority to those which affect the  model and abstract syntax.    The list of currently active issues is:         http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-identity-anon-resources       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-graph       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-xmllang       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-literals-as-resources       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure         http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfs-domain-and-range       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfs-domain-unconstrained       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr        http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/rdf-terminologicus    The first grouping has the potential to affect the abstract syntax,  depending on how they are resolved.  That was my reason for activating them,  and these should therefore have high priority, until we can at least  determine that the resolution will not affect the abstract syntax.    Are there other issues which should belong in that group?  For example,  Sergey has raised the question of whether namespaces are part of the model.    On the question of literals as resources, I've looked through the recent  email traffic and the logs and minutes of last Friday's discussion.  I'd  like to test support for this position:      o the WG agrees that URI's can be assigned to denote literals.      o it is not a priority for the WG to define a URI scheme for literals      at this time.      o those who are interested in designing such a scheme are encouraged      to do so in www-rdf-interest.      o a specific representation for literals remains a part of n-triples      and the abstract syntax.    We also have a host of semantic questions regarding the model, and  they are all highly inter-related.  How best to tackle those?  Here is a suggestion.    We cannot tackle them piecemeal, one at a time, they are too inter-  related for that.  In agreement with Frank Manola's  recent comments about discussing issues in the light of a specific  text, how about we begin with a strawman model theory  and discuss the issues in the light of that.  Maybe one of our  logician's, Pat - you've mentioned model theory several times - could  produce a strawman.    Would this be a good way forward with the technical discussions?

        Friday's telecon reminded me that I had left test case A in for a   reason.  There was more I had to say about it, and writing that message the   following occurred to me.    Test case A says:       <s1> <p> "lit" .     <s2> <p> "lit" .    can we conclude that value of both properties are the same.    Consider       _:b1 rdf:type rdf:Seq .     _:b1 rdf:_1   "10" .     _:b2 rdf:type rdf:Seq .     _:b2 rdf:_1   "10" .    This would require that the first member of each sequence is the same.    Given that we also have a common superproperty of the rdf:_xxx properties,   this essentially means that all literals which are members of any container   must all have the same dataype, i.e. all literals in containers must be tidy.    I suggest this is incompatible with the untidy literals and a yes to test   case A above.    The approach to untidiness suggested at the face to face was a   compromise.  I think this example demonstrates that compromise does not   work and we have to choose between tidiness or a stronger notion of untidyness.    Brian

Consider a meeting with the director requesting advancement to PR.    Director:  Hmmm, quite a few of the implementations seem not to be   implementing this test case.    WG:  That's because we defined the L2V mapping strictly according to XSD   datatypes and don't include white space processing.

Hmmm, that seems like a question about the nature of resources and what   names them.  These are questions we have kicked to the tag.    Have I understood you correctly?

Consider the literal "Wuthering Heights":    The statements:       "Wuthering Heights"  <rdf:type> <rdf:Literal> .     "Wuthering Heights"  <ex:length> "17" . # ignoring datatyping    are reasonable and true since the resource "Wuthering Heights" denotes the   literal "Wuthering Heights" which is both a literal and of length 17 chars   (if I've counted correctly).       "Wuthering Heights" <rdf:type> <ex:book> .    is a silly thing to say because "Wuthering Heights" is a 17 character   string which is a bit too short to qualify as a book.  Under our present   proposals, "Wuthering Heights" cannot denote the book Wuthering Heights.    This is what I think you may have meant when you said that Literals cannot   denote 'interesting' resources.    Why allow literals to be subjects?  Well, some folks have said that   literals meet all the criteria to be a resource, so its a bit strange to   say that they can't be.    My working assumption is that literals remain tidy - loosely, they always   denote themselves.  Would you agree that, with that limitation a future WG   may choose to allow them to be subjects.    But also note, that we cannot tie the hands of a future WG.  Just as we are   changing things in m&s, a future WG, for reasons of its own, may decide to   allow literals to be untidy.

It was felt that asking users to distinguish between   two uri's for a datatype, one for the class and one for the property would   be unnecessarily confusing.    The notion that classes and properties were not disjoint has been around   for many months and has found general acceptance.  I'm not convinced that   SWAD's lint application is sufficiently strong justification to reopen this.    Brian        

        Jeremy,    Can you be more specific.  We can make corrections within the first 24   hours, I believe.  Eric has just been slaving to do a number of   corrections.

        I recently sent a heads up [1] to the chairs list concerning review of   RDFCore's 2nd last call documents which contained an error, assuming   there was a URI WG in W3C.    RDFCore are seeking appropriate review of its 2nd last call WD's and I   would like ask the uri-cg where we should seek reviews of these   documents.  Aspects of the documents that may be of interest to this   group are the use of xml:base (which has not changed significantly since   1st last call) and internationalization of URI's.

That is not what this particular chair said.    I believe I said, that datatyping was important, that we should 'get it right',   and if getting it right was in conflict with the charter, we should solve the   charter problem.    I note ;) that one way to solve this sort of charter problem would be to leave   such an issue for the next round.  I say this not because I'm advocating that at   this stage, but just to make sure folks understand we are not necessarily   running out an liberalising the charter right now.    Brian        

      Last week we discussed teleconference facilities at the f2f.  Of the folks   who can't be there, who would participate in a telecon starting at 4pm   (10am EST, 7am PST) each day?    I suggest we summarize the decisions made earlier in the day and discuss   any issues held over for the telecon.    I'd like to stress though, that the folks attending the telecon, are   empowered to make decisions.    Eric - can you please book a conference bridge for those times for two   hours (we don't have to use it all) and telecon facilities at the f2f venue.    Brian

This also links up with Aaron's suggestion that we should show how this  can be done with DAML+OIL.    Can anyone help clarify?    As its in the log, I've added to the minutes, an action on Jan  to provide  an explanation of how sub-classing containers could be added to RDF Schema.  We can consider at the telecon whether this is in fact the right action.    Brian

If you have an issue with how the model theory defines a graph that would be in   order.

        Hi Jeremy,    Welcome back; its been an interesting week and I'm trying here to save   you having to pour over too many emails before you get back up to speed.    We are now hoping to have the docs ready and implementation report for   Aug 8th.    Some things that need your attention:    xmlsch-02: it seems that we have made the wrong choice in the handling   of whitespace facets.  Please could consider whether we ought to change   our mind on how these are handled.    definition of rdf:XMLLiteral    We have a couple of issues this:      - The current text about the lexical space talks about "corresponding"   which has caused Peter some grief - the text does need refining.  Graham   had a go:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0125.html    - Further, there has been some concern raised over the value space being   octet sequences, and intersecting with other schema datatypes.  I'd   appreciate your views on the discussion.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JulSep/0125.html      Brian        

        I'm about to put together the agenda for the telecon and decided I needed a   prioritized list of 'issues' we need to resolve to make progress.  I also   figured I might as well share it so folks can request tweaks.    all1: To label or not to label nodes.  -------------------------------------    This is a question about how the abstract syntax is described.  Do we talk   about nodes labelled with URI's etc or do we talk about URI's as the nodes?  This is crucial as all the specs depend on the description of the abstract   syntax.  Must fix.  The concepts doc is definitive here.  2.4.2 currently   labels nodes as does section 4.  Pat has proposed new language in:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0523.html    We need to decide.    all2: lang tags on datayped literals.  -------------------------------------    Nokia, having previously dissented if the abstract syntax for a datatyped   literal did not contain a language string, have now withdrawn that dissent   and suggested that the language string be withdrawn from the abstract   syntax of a datatyped literal.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0541.html    Whilst I am reluctant to reopen old issues, this does look like a better   option, but have we already have committed ourselves to the lang string in   the way we have handled the XMLLiteral datatype.    Is there support for this request?  If so, is it feasible to make it.    mt3: What do old style literals denote  --------------------------------------    I've seen the following options:       o strings     o pairs (string, langTag)     o UNION of strings and (string, langTag)    see thread:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0459.html  and     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0388.html    Schema1: Whats in the class rdf:Literal?  -----------------------------------------    Two suggestions, the class extension of rdf:Literal contains       o union of denotation of old style literals and class extension of XMLiteral       o as above union the class extensions of all members of rdfs:Datatype      mt2: Datatypes in the semantics.  --------------------------------       see thread beginning:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Oct/0569.html      mt1: List semantics.  --------------------    Do we have a strong semantics for lists in RDF.  The general recollection (mine included) seems to be that we had decided   no.  I am going to regard this as a proposal from Pat, to reconsider   this.  Pat, is there new information?        Con1: Title: data model or abstract syntax  ------------------------------------------    Propose change title to abstract syntax.      Style9: Ensuring consistentcy of terminology.    Style1: boilerplate for list of docs    Style2: standard names for references    Style3: boilerplate for current and previous wg members    Style4: standard format for code blocks    Style5: standard color schemes    Style6: boilerplate for what we are looking for feedback on    Style7: style for notes    Style8: style and policy for referring to test cases    Style10:ensuring integrity of references between docs

I'm not defending it, but it would be a uniform mechanism for all XML  documents.  Its a shame that XHTML is treated differently.  Is the reason  for this that adding the attribute would break the DTD?    Brian        

        Assuming the new approach to datatypes, broadly as described in Part 1 of   Patrick's document, continues to enjoy the support of the WG, the WG may   like to consider distributing the contents of part 1 amongst the other   specifications.    It may seem a strange structure if, for example, the 'Concepts' document   described the abstract syntax and concepts of RDF, but referred to a   separate datatypes document for the datatypes bit.  And if it does not,   then it must describe the complete abstract syntax and duplicate some of   the datatypes document.  The same is true of the syntax document, the model   theory, schema (I believe it is affected by datatypes now) and possibly the   primer.    We are now in a position where datatypes are no longer layered on top of   the core RDF data model, but are an integral part of it.  We could describe   datatyping in the specs as follows:       primer:     Introduction to using datatyped values in RDF     syntax:     rdf/xml representation of datatype values     concepts:   abstract syntax; concept of datatyped values     schema:     datatype vocabulary definitions; effects on domain and   range; relationship                 between literals and datatype literals     model th:   model theory for datatype values     test cases: n-triples    I'm planning to allow some time in tomorrows telecon to discuss this   approach.  If it finds support, it would be great if we could to the point   of the various doc editors having actions to update their docs to describe   datatyping.    Brian        

      Sergey,    An excellent writeup!    If I can summarise and respond:    o You assert that the model described in M&S does not include namespaces    I'm not sure I agree with that.  See below.    o You assert that implementations need to handle namespaces.    My question here is whether an *implementation* can represent a uri as  a pair.  The answer its yes, of course, because you and I at least  both have implementations that do exactly that.  We can do that without  changing the abstract model.    o The specs talk about being to lookup the schema for properties by  accessing their namespace.  The information to do this must be in the  abstract model somehow.  One way is to represent properties as pairs;  another is add extra triples to the model; another is to postulate  the existence some service that will map URI's to namespaces; others?    One thing to do here is to ask those working on rdf schema what they  need in the model.  Is it the intention that schemas can be accessed  given the namespace URI?  How is the namespace URI to be determined  from the model?  Does this apply just to properties?    o proposal for introducing namespaces    A fundamental tennet of web architecture is that resources are  identified by URI's.  Your proposal changes that so that rdf resources  become identified by pairs of unicode strings.  This is a fundamental  change to web architecture.  Methinks that is a step too far for this  WG at this time (which is not to say that its a bad idea.)    It may be more in our scope for resources to be identified by URI's,   but representing those URI's in the model as pairs.  This could  prepare the way for further changes in the future.

As things stand there is no domain constraint on rdf:_nnn.  When you say _1 is functional, is that a property of  rdf:_1 wherever it is found, or is that a property of rdf:_1  when it is applied to containers?    Brian

Their has been some recent discussion on whether they   denote (string,lang) pairs or the union of strings and (string, lang)   pairs.  To the best of my recollection, denoting just strings is not a   current option.    >  and therefore  >the above range assertion is a datatype clash! It is *never* OK.  >Never ever ever. It is not possible for it to ever be OK.    Why not?  Surely that depends on whether the value spaces of literals and   anyURI's are disjoint.  If literals can denote strings (as you claim they   can), and anyURI's are strings, then this is not necessarily a datatype clash.  [...]    >Furthermore, not that xsd:anyURI is *not* a subtype even of xsd:string!  >I.e., even XML Schema says that a member of the value space of xsd:anyURI  >is *not* a member of the value space of xsd:string -- a URI is not a string!    A reference would be helpful here.  Where does  XSD say that different   primitive types must have disjoint value spaces.    It is true that anyURI is not derived from xsd:string, but is that because   the value spaces are different, or because there is no facet that would   allow exact expression of the value space of anyURI?  The only facet that   might be used is PATTERN which requires a regular expression.  If the   grammar for anyURI cannot be expressed as regular expression, then anyURI   cannot be derived from xsd:string.    Brian        

        Thank you Patrick for your strawman proposal and provoking a discussion   which I hope will ensure we express ourselves carefully and wisely.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0092.html    Your action is recorded in the draft minutes as:       ACTION 2002-12-06#3 PatrickS: draft one paragraph about  rdfs:isDefinedBy and other terms to draw out them for readers of  the primer    which looking at the transcript:       http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2002-12-06#T15-21-40    was result of a comment from Frank:    [[  FrankM: isDefinedBy mentioned not described in the primer. Do people want   that added? If so, let me know.  ]]    With regards to isDefinedBy, I think it would be fine for the primer to say   nothing about it.  If the WG felt that the primer would be enhanced by a   short description, I might suggest something along the lines of the   following would describe the WG's decision:    [[  It is often useful to indicate in an RDF graph where the definition of a   class or a property, or indeed any resource, may be found.  The   rdfs:isDefinedBy property may be used for this purpose.  This property may   be used to indicate an RDF Schema that describes the resource, however, RDF   imposes no constraints on the values this property.  If the resource that   is the value of such a property is retrieved from the web, it may be an RDF   Schema, but there is no guarantee that it will be.  ]]    This text lacks the lightness of touch and ease on the readers eye that I   would hope for in the primer, so does require some help from the editor,   but I hope indicates the sort of thing we might usefully say in this document.

See  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003May/0402.html  for decision.    > owlsas-rdfcore-bnodes-restrictions    We agree that there may be cause for concern, but note that the changes  requested would minimally require a major rework of the direct semantics of  OWL DL. (Section 3 of S&AS).    We have created a new issue and postponed it, so that a future group may,  with  the benefit of deployment experience, assess whether these concerns were  legitimate, and whether the quantity of work required to attempt to address  this issue is motivated.    We are still considering relaxing some of the constraints on bnodes  corresponding to class expressions; however, this does not seem to be your  main concern. We will notify you of any change.

      Hi Frank,    I had been hoping to have Danbri around when we discussed this and he  won't be there tomorrow, but you are right - it would be better not  to waste time.

I'd like to check whether folks think the SWBPD WG the best place to own   this specific issue, and others of a similar ilk?    But more relevant to this agenda item, would we envisage setting up a   task force to deal with each incoming issue?  Are task forces to   accepted issues 1-1?

The  issue on the table, as far as I'm concerned is dealing with horst-01.   horst-01 is about the incompleteness of the closure rules with respect  to the MT.

        Well done everyone.    Since we have so many working drafts, it makes sense to send out just one   announcement for them all.  If no one objects, I'll do that tomorrow.

      RDFCore WG members,    The first phone conference of the RDF Core group will take place on  Friday 20th April 2001 at:      10:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in America/New_York    15:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in Europe/London    22:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in Asia/Hong Kong    23:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in Asia/Tokyo    00:00:00 Sat Apr 21 2001 in Australia/Sydney    Please note this is a change from the date on the web site and is  the Friday immediately before WWW10 in Hong Kong.  Please inform the  chairs if you don't plan to attend.    The phone number for the conference call is:      +1 617 258 7910    There will be an accompanying IRC channel #rdfcore on  irc.openprojects.net:      irc://irc.openprojects.net/rdfcore    The IRC channel will be used to take notes of the meeting and may be  used to 'raise a hand' to indicate a desire to speak.      We would like to keep things reasonably informal.  There are just a few  procedural matters to propose:    W3C process calls for an agenda to be available 24 hours before the  conference.  If you'd like to suggest items for the agenda, please send  them to the chairs by 0900 UK time on the Thursday before the meeting.    I suggest we aim to have any documents due for discussion at a  conference distributed by the same time.    We will call for a volunteer scribe for each meeting.  The idea is to  share this task around.  In the absence of volunteers, the chairs will  appoint someone.  The scribe should use the IRC channel to record their  notes.  Actions should be circulated within 24 hours and minutes should  be curculated with 48 hours of the end of the meeting.  The IRC log and  the minutes will be publicly visible.    Thats about it for phone conferences.  See you on Friday 27th.    Brian

Given the capabalities of RDFS, how could you know that one type is NOT a   subClassOf another?    Brian

Just so; the thing that breaks it is the merging of the rangeLex's though,   not the representing a literal as a pair.    Brian

        I interpret this as a proposal to remove test case       http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/xmlbase/test012    which I suggest we discuss at today's telecon.    A possible response to the commentor might be:    [[  Thank you for pointing out this proposed change to RFC 2396 which we had   been unaware of.    RDFCore have resolved to remove this test case.    RDFCore would advise implementors that consume RDF that the RDFCore   specs are based on RFC 2396, a strict interpretation of which states   that URI's with too many ".."'s in their path are an error, though many   URI implementations correct that error and RFC 2396bis proposes to   require that correction.  Implementors are free to choose whether to   strictly comply with RFC 2396 or be more liberal.    RDFCore advises implementors and content creators that produce RDF that   creating URI's with too many ".."'s in their path is inadvisable and may   lead to interoperability problems.  ]]    Brian    Jeremy Carroll wrote:  >   > I've looked through 2396bis  >   > http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rev-2002/draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis-03.html  >   > It seems to be as the commentator said - there is a change and .. are   > systematically eliminate during URI resolution.  >   > In the change log:  >   > [[  > Separated the path merge routine into two routines: merge, for describing   > combination of the base URI path with a relative-path reference, and   > remove_dot_segments, for describing how to remove the special "." and ".."   > segments from a composed path.

Thank you Patrick.  I think this means that I've seen both you and Sergey   agree to this.    I think its up to you and Sergey to agree how best to get this document   done.  However, Sergey's suggestion of keeping it simple (email format?),   focussing on the core agreements/issues, and starting from Pat's recent   email, which is neutral territory, might permit a faster and more   interactive evolution of a proposal/agreement.

            -------- Original Message --------  Subject: Request for PR of Namespaces in XML 1.1  Resent-Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2003 12:39:34 -0400 (EDT)  Resent-From: chairs@w3.org  Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2003 11:38:52 -0500  From: Paul Grosso <pgrosso@arbortext.com>  <richard@cogsci.ed.ac.uk>        The XML Core WG requests publication of the following document as a W3C  Proposed Recommendation:  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/05/PR-xml-names11/    The URL cited above is for the most recent Member-only version of the  specification, dated 10 October 2003.    The Namespaces in XML 1.1 specification was published as a Candidate  Recommendation on 18 December 2002. A document containing the comments  received from other WGs and the public as well as the WG's final disposition  of those comments may be found at:  http://www.w3.org/XML/2003/06/ns11-cr-doc.html    The XML Core WG has not received any replies from commenters saying that our  responses were inadequate. We did receive several replies saying our answers  were fine.    The document being sent to PR contains the changes that were made to  accommodate these comments.    The WG's decision to request publication as a Proposed Recommendation  was taken during a teleconference on 8 October 2003, minutes may be  found at:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003OctDec/0034      EXITING CR    The main purposes of the CR period was to gain feedback based on  implementation experience. The XML Core WG set a goal of having at least 2  successful implementations of the specification. As of today, we know of at  least 3 implementations. See the implementation report at:    http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/12/xml-names11-implementation      SCHEDULE    We propose that the PR period for Namespaces in XML 1.1 to last for  eight weeks from publication.      REQUIREMENTS OF TRANSITION    The XML Core WG approved publication during our telcon of 2003 Oct 8:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003OctDec/0034    Changes to the document are outlined in Appendices C and D of the document.    The WG believes it has addressed all of the requirements in the RD at  http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xml-names11-req-20020403/    Evidence that issues have been addressed can be seen  in our Disposition of Comments document at  http://www.w3.org/XML/2003/06/ns11-cr-doc.html    An Implementation report is at  http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/12/xml-names11-implementation    Our IPR disclosure page is at  http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xmlcore-IPR-statements      PROPOSED PR ABSTRACT AND STATUS SECTIONS    Abstract  --------  XML namespaces provide a simple method for qualifying element and attribute  names used in Extensible Markup Language documents by associating them with  namespaces identified by IRI references.    Status of this document  -----------------------  This section describes the status of this document at the time of its  publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current  W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be  found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.    This document, Namespaces in XML 1.1, is a Proposed Recommendation of the  W3C. This document has been produced by the W3C XML Core Working Group as  part of the XML Activity.    W3C Advisory Committee Representatives are invited to send formal review  comments by following the instructions in the Call for Review. Through a  form available from the Call for Review, Advisory Committee representatives  should send comments to the Team-only list xml-namespaces11-review@w3.org  until 30 November 2003. Through the form, Advisory Committee   representatives  may also make their comments visible to the Membership (on  w3c-ac-forum@w3.org for discussion or w3c-archive@w3.org). The public is  invited to send comments to the public mailing list xml-names-editor@w3.org  (archived at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-names-editor/). After  the review the Director will announce the document's disposition. This  announcement should not be expected sooner than 14 days after the end of   the  review.    This document is based upon the Namespaces in XML 1.1 Candidate  Recommendation of 18 December 2002 and feedback received during the review  period (see the Disposition of Comments document). The XML Core Working  Group believes that this specification addresses its Requirements and all  Last Call and Candidate Recommendation issues. Known implementations are  documented in the Namespaces 1.1 implementation report. A test suite is   also  available.    Documentation of intellectual property possibly relevant to this  Recommendation may be found at the Working Group's public IPR disclosure   page.    Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the  W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or  obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this  document as other than work in progress.      Paul Grosso and Arnaud Le Hors, chairs of the XML Core WG.

We are straying into specifying things about xsd   that are not up to us.  But I do think we have to do that for the 10 and 010 cases.  I do think   those need to be changed, but would want a second opinion.    >- so where I've indicated test cases for equivalence between typed  >literals in different datatypes, these probably fall into the same  >category as JJC's boolean test case: that is, we attach a note to them  >or something but don't approve them as part of the subset of test cases  >that goes with the test case document.

I'd like to be sure we understand the relationship of rdfs:subClassOf to  Owl.  As I understand things, the intent is that Owl would retain  extensional semantics.  Is that correct.    If so, then Owl want a stronger notion of subClassOf than that proposed  in this document for rdfs:subClassOf.     Would that meant that the 'correct' thing for WEBONT to do would be to  define owl:subClassOf as a subproperty of rdfs:subClassOf?    Brian

As I recall, Pat is travelling in the early part of this week.  This   will hamper clarification of this issue.    The suggestion is that a substantive change, i.e. one visible in a test   case, has been inadvertently made without consulting the WG.  If true,   that is unfortunate.    However, I suggest the barrier to reopening the PR decision is quite   high.  Procedural irregularity is not enough.  Lets address substantive   matters.    - Are you saying that HP cannot live with the current specifications?    >   > [This is nullified if Pat or others, can make a compelling case that I have   > misunderstood the situation, and the correct understanding of the two test   > cases is the same in both LC2 semantics and the current editors draft]    This suggests that HP can live with the current situation.

But it   occurred to me we could put an xml:base attribute on outer elements in the   literal, the way we are doing with namespaces.  I'm not suggesting this;   just asking for my own education.      >2) the <a> has no namespace.  >    RDF/XML doesn't apply to non-namespaced elements anywhere  >  >3) X/HTML don't use xml:base so even if it was an X/HTML fragment  >    and element, it wouldn't apply.    And I wasn't sure about that.  I believe HTML has a base attribute; I   wasn't sure if they had endorsed xml:base.    Thanks Dave.    Brian

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.    I'm hoping to decide on the disposition of some last call issues, so it   would be helpful to have hints from editors about those they like on the   agenda.    Other possibles include:      o FAQ: Relationship to XML Family of specs    o XML Schema 1.1 Requirements    Brian

I was not proposing we discuss resolutions of the   issues, but suggestions to the CG of how/whether these issues might, at   some point in the future be resolved.  For example, the WG might   recommend to the CG that some issues are higher priority than others.    Is that a discussion you feel able to contribute to?    Brian

The WG resolves that:    Boolean valued properties can, in part, be expressed using rdf:type, for   example:       <http://example/George> <rdf:type> <http://example/ChocolateLover> .     <http://example/Thomas> <rdf:type> <http://example/ChocolateHater> .    The WG notes that RDF(S) defines no built in mechanism for expressing that   ChocolateLover and ChocolateHater are disjoint classes.  The WEBONT WG  are defining mechanisms for such expressions.

        summary: no show stoppers.      1. FIX: subject of a statement (after last call)    In       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#dfn-subject    concepts defines the subject of a *triple* to be an RDF URI Reference.      In       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-schema-20030117/#ch_statement    Schema defines the subject of a *statement* to be the resource named by the   URI that is the subject of the triple.    Primer describes the subject of a *statement* to be a URI reference.  This   mixes the two definitions.    I suggest the text in section 4.3 on Reification needs to be reviewed   against the text in the schema doc to ensure consistency.    2. Amused    [[ ex:fred is an ex:primaryDriver of the instance ex:companyVan  ]]    If you read that aloud, it sounds like there has been a serious accident :)    3. remove changes section at the end

Click, I think.    Its the "in owl lite" and "in owl full" language that confused me I think.    Can I think of this as:       rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf owl:Class .    is true, but something that OWL DL reasoners don't know.    That fixes my "naive user assumption" problem with the denotation.    But it still leaves me wondering why its needed.  If its ok to feed only   some of the semantics to a DL reasoner, why not stick to rdfs:Class but let   it have only a limited understanding of Class?    Brian

It seems as though the context has some significance in how we  view this scenario.  The participants have intent to establish  commercial transactions.  Lets try a thought experiment, change  the scenario and see how that affects how we look on it.    Two folks, Anna and Bertie have home pages on the web.  For no  other reason than its the done thing to do to be hip, they  include in their home pages RDF statements about where they live  and where they work e.g.      <Anna>      <livesAt> _:AnnasHome .    _:AnnasHome <zipcode> "12345" .    <Anna>      <worksAt> _:AnnasWork .    _:AnnasWork <zipcode> "54321" .      <Bertie>      <livesAt> _:BertiesHome .    _:BeritesHome <zipcode> "12345" .    <Bertie>      <worksAt> _:BertiesWork .    _:BertiesWork <zipcode> "54321" .    Pure assertions, yes?  No query, yes?  No intent to create   a relationship, yes?    Friends of the Planet have noticed this hip behaviour and they  have a web crawler that sucks up this information and looks  for folks with close home and work zip codes and sends them  email suggesting they might like to car share.    Seems to me that the processing that goes in this scenario and  the original are effectively the same.  The point is, that the  query, if there is one, is a feature of a third party, not of  the publishers of the RDF.    BTW, Anna has two homes, both with the same zipcode.      > Once  > we talk about things that are done with, or as a result of,  > publishing some RDF, we need to be clearer about what relationships  > are being assumed between the RDF that is being published.

I don't dispute that different processing may be required in  different circumstances.  But those circumstances may not depend  on the intentions of the publishers of the RDF.    Does this shed any light on where I'm going wrong?  My brain is beginning to hurt.    Brian

        At Tuesday's telecon we recorded individual actions on folks to update docs   and send responses.  Normally, I track all actions individually, but I just   don't have the bandwidth to do that for all of these.    Therefore:      o I have silently dropped those actions from my list    o I will rely on the doc editors to track the changes they have to make    o whether responses have been sent will be tracked in the comment   tracking document    o I urge editors to follow Frank's practice to record the doc change   reference in sending responses    Brian

        This was an action to create a postponed issue to consider representing   langauge information in the triple structure.  I've done this by   appending it to       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfs-lang-vocab    Brian        

      I have been encouraged by Jeremy to repeat some remarks which might help   clarify this part of this discussion.  There has been an ongoing debate   about whether "1984" has a -consistent global meaning-.  I suggest some of   the confusion comes from different use of language amongst members of the   WG and suggest the following simple model might be helpful.    Consider an implementation model where we have an application built on a   generic RDF processing tool.                      Application              ---------------------  the line              Generic RDF Processor    Lets take S idiom B:       <book> <dc:Title> "1984" .     <mary> <age>      "1984" .    Below the line only processing which conforms with the RDF model theory is   sanctioned.  Below the line, both occurences of the string "1984" denote a   string.    This does not preclude an application applying above the line knowledge   that the value of the <age> property is the lexical representation of a   integer, get the value of the <age> property of Mary, which is "1984",   transform it to an integer and then do whatever it likes with that   value.  But than happens above the line.    When Dan says that "1984" has a single consistent global interpretation, I   take him to mean, that applies below the line.  Below the line, only the   model theory applies.   Nothing I have seen DanC write has suggested to me   that an application is in some way prohibited from interpreting "1984" as   the lexical representation of an integer.    When Patrick says that it has been clearly demonstrated that "1984" cannot   have a single global intepretation, I believe he is referring to the above   the line interpretation.    Thus Patrick and Dan are talking about different things and they could both   be right.

Aaron, can I take this as your proxy to vote for advancing to last call?    I'll reply separately about noting your issues to create a separate thread.    Brian        

        looks ok to me.    I suggest that we particularly want to highlight i18n's xml lang/xml   literal issue and request feedback, say in both concepts and in syntax,   and in the announcement.    Does it make sense for such highlighting to go in the status section?

My only comments are that my issues (misuse of   >fragments, using IRIs instead of URIs, overly-complex datatypes solution,   >... I think that's it) should be noted as required by process.    I think this bit we have to do by the book.  I'm not trying to throw   process obstacles in the way; I want a full and good review by the   community, but I'd better make sure we satisfy the process contraints.    The process doc       http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/tr.html#RecsWD    states:    [[Any time a technical report advances to a higher maturity level, the   announcement of the transition must indicate any formal objections.]]    It also states:    [[Possible next maturity level. The Working Group may advance a Working   Draft to Last Call Working Draft.]]    which means that going to last call is an advance in maturity level and   thus the announcement must indicate any formal objections.    The process doc       http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/groups.html#WGArchiveMinorityViews    further states:    [[A formal objection should include technical arguments and propose changes   that would remove the dissenter's objection; these proposals may be vague   or incomplete. The Chair must report an objection that includes such   information to the Director at later review stages (e.g., in the request to   the Director to advance a technical report to Candidate Recommendation). If   an objection does not include this information, the Chair is not required   to report it at later review stages.]]    At this time, I don't believe the co-chairs have received any formal   objections.    An alternative is to include something less formal in the announcement of   last call.  Something, perhaps along the lines of:    The working group particularly seeks feedback on:       o RDF's use of fragment identifiers     o the introduction of internationalized URI's     o the datatyping support proposed     o whether to change the URIREF's for the RDF and RDFS namespaces    The difficulty with this, is that I expect the WG as a whole would agree to   the last two of these, but I'm not sure whether there would be sufficient   support for the first two as you may be the only WG member that has an   issue with those.    Brian

Ok.  I should have known better.  I didn't read far enough down the  section.    The text states that the following triple is added to the graph:      e.parent.subject.string-value <e.URI> o.string-value    where o.string-value links to:    [[  string-value                      The value is the concatenation of the following in this order          """ (1 double quote), the value of the ??literal-value?? accessor,          """ (1 double quote), "^^<", the value of the ??literal-datatype??          accessor and ">".   ]]    This is then overridden by    [[  The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal is the Exclusive  XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]) with comments and with empty  InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList of the literal text l, i.e. the entire  element content of this property element.  ]]    The term lexical form of the XML literal does not bind strongly to  o.string-value.  Thats why I got confused.    Brian

Can we take this point   in the context of those issues.  We need to be thinking in terms of moving   towards closure so I'm a bit sensitive about more work not necessary for   completion of our task.    Brian

        This is a belated call for agenda items/issue resolutions for this weeks   telecon.    I note Jeremy has completed his action of proposing comment resolutions and   I believe there are some on semantics I believe we might progress.    Syntax?  Schema?    Brian

We don't want to spend forever on this.    Jan has made a proposal for a simple triple based syntax.  DanC has  said he'd prefer something N3 compatible.      I'm assuming that for clarity we'd be restricting test cases to the  simplest      S P O.    form of N3 - I'd hate for anything to be unclear because we are not  sure what N3 means exactly.    If thats the case, there is very little difference between the two,  and there may well be an advantage to going with a format that N3  processers can slurp in directly.    If:      o DanC were to  propose a way of augmenting "S P O." to represent      anonymous nodes.      o We have an issue #rdfms-xmllang questioning representing the xml:lang      attribute as part of the literal.  If the outcome of that lang       attributes are part of the literal value then we'll augment this      syntax to include a lang attribute in a literal.    would that meet our needs?    Brian        

      Hi Graham,    Thanks for this.  One question:    Graham Klyne wrote:    >   > NOTE:  "reification" is deliberately called out as a distinct syntax  > production, so that there is a place to hang the semantics that distinguish  > it from any other collection of facts.

In M&S 1.0 the statements of a reification (i.e. the rdf:type, rdf:subject,  etc ...) are no different from other statements.  What difference are  you considering introducing here?    Brian        

      I'd like to clear the decks as much as possible before the face to face so   we can concentrate our time there on problematic issues.  So here are a   bunch of issue resolution proposals I'd like to bring up at this week's   telecon.    I could have sent each of these out as a separate mail message, but in the   intersts of not generating too much mail traffic, I didn't.  If you have   issues with any of the proposals, please respond to each proposal in a   separate message to keep the discussion clear.    rdfms-graph: Formal description of the properties of an RDF graph.    Propose the WG resolve that the model theory is a formal description of the   properties of an RDF graph and that this issue be closed.    rdfms-literals-as-resources: Consider replacing literals with resources   whose URI uses the data: URI scheme.    Propose the WG resolve that the proposed change would be a major change to   the RDF specification and is out of scope for this WG.    rdfms-uri-substructure: xmlns, uri+name pairs or just uris..? Clarification   needed (Sergey Melnik)      Propose the WG resolves that changing how resources are named on the web is   a web architecture issue and beyond the scope of our charter.    rdfms-literalsubjects: Should the subjects of RDF statements be allowed to   be literals?    I suggest that changing the RDF/XML syntax to support this is out of charter.    Propose       o the WG resolves that the current syntaxes (RDF/XML, n-triples, graph   syntax) do not allow literals as subjects.       o the WG notes that it is aware of no reason why literals should not be   resources and a future WG with a less restrictive charter may extend the   syntaxes to allow literals as the subjects of statements.      rdf-containers-otherapproaches: The design of the RDF Model collection   classes exhibit various awkward features. Might these be augmented with a   'better' design?    Propose the WG resolves this issue is out of scope for this WG but places   the issue on the list of to be considered by a future WG.    rdf-formal-semantics: The RDF Model and Syntax Rec and RDF Schema CR do not   provide a formal specification of the semantics of RDF.    Propose the WG resolves that the model theory defines formal semantics for   RDF and that this issue be closed.    rdfms-propElt-id-with-dr : Clarify the interpretation of an ID attribute in   the propertyElt production within a Description element with a distributive   referrant.    Propose the WG resolves that this issue be closed on the grounds that with   the removal of rdf:aboutEachPrefix and rdf:aboutEach there are no   distributive referrants and the issue is mute.

The question was about RDF entailment.  Pat states that my test  entailment, which just uses RDF vocabulary, holds in RDF.  I think you  are now saying that it doesn't.

Right - we are in agreement here - sorry if I wasn't clear.  The WG has   decided and yes, your action  is to write the formal response matching that   decision.  Avoiding military metaphors, I'm suggesting we get our ducks   well lined up.      >>Also, I think we agreed to put health warnings on semantics and schema so   >>that folks were aware of what reification isn't appropriate for.  >  >I guess I should add that to the response?    Yes please.    Brian        

        Brian hasn't been able to get further reviewing done on this doc   today.  However, Brian gives it a cautious thumbs up for publishing, having   found no showstoppers and being impressed by the small number of comments   on the technical meat of the document from other reviewers.  Brian suggests   the published version includes:      o a statement that any conflict between section 2 and the more formal   sections of the spec, section 2 loses.      o a disclaimer in section 2 saying that whilst the substance is not   expected to change much, it is new text that is likely to undergo   substantial editorial revision.    One of Brian's considerations is there is a need to have WD's to refer to,   to communicate the WG's decision on datatypes to the webont folks.  That   should be done soon.  Brian thinks the presence of the datatyping example   in section 2 will help webont folks see what we have done more easily than   interpreting the grammar.  He finds this a convincing argument that section   2 is needed.    Similarly, whilst Brian splattered a load of comments on the concepts doc,   he found no show stoppers and thinks it should go.    Brian        

        This is a strawman schedule for getting to LC2.    The chairs have not heard anyone proposing any changes to address the   concerns raised by I18N.  Peter has declined to participate in a   detailed review of the semantics doc prior to last call.  This removes   two uncertainties affecting the schedule.    We have an external dependency on XML schema commenting on xmlsch-02   test case.  I'm not sure if we have to wait for that before LC2 Comments?    We published the current WD's on 05 Sep.  Suggest -       Comment deadline:  03 Oct     LC2 Docs ready     10 Oct     Publish LC2        13 Oct     End LC2 comments   03 Nov    Brian        

        My goal here is to ensure that we have an appropriate document at the   end of the RDF namespace URI when we go to PR.

Thought it might make a change from tidy/untidy :)    In a recent conversation I thought it was said that there was no   requirement that an RDF/XML processor need do 'standard' xml processing.

I'm wondering if I did that too quickly.  I'm planning to try to update the   comment tracking doc once at the beginning and once at the end of each   working day.  I could wait for the editors to request an id, but if I'd   done that Peter might still be waiting, so I've been using my judgement,   which may save the editors a small amount of work. This may mean I allocate   an id to a comment that is soon withdrawn.  I regard that as my bad luck.      >I want to have a short discussion with Dan about this before the telecon on  >Friday when I take it we will discuss it.    Good plan.      >So I send a message to Dan and to www-rdf-comments    I'd suggest you just reply to the message I sent allocating the id.

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.    I'm anticipating a meeting focussed around getting ready for a second   last call.    - review of outstanding comments/issues  - review of outstanding actions  - handling the 2nd last call comment process    Brian

        This is the not so usual lately call for agenda items for a telecon this     week.    I'm not sure there is a lot to discuss.  If there is no formal business   to conduct, I'm going to suggest getting together at the usual time   informally.    Brian        

        I have updated the face to face page       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020617-f2f/    to include a list of actions and decisions taken at the meeting and to   point to the irc logs.    This is all I currently plan to do as minutes of the meeting.    I've also included a number of pictures I took.  If anyone has anyone has   any objection to any of the images, please let me know and I'll remove it.    Brian        

      It is time to get started.  To kick things off I'm making this proposal  for how we proceed.    Our schedule is:       May  - publish revised issue list, initial update MS errate page     June - face to face     Aug  - public working draft documents    The approach I propose is that we begin by focusing on describing and  resolving the issues, then move to a spec writing phase once the key  issues are resolved.  There are currently 41 model and syntax issues,  14 schema issues and one against the FAQ.    This way we will be able to split the work out amongst ourselves,  bringing back descriptions, analysis and recommendations for  consideration by the group as a whole.    I propose that by end of May we aim to:      o classify the issues    o update the issue list with clear descriptions and analysis of      the issues    o update the errata pages    By the end of the June face to face we:      o have have key issues resolved    o document structure agreed    o editors appointed    By end of August we:      o have first public drafts of documents    We need to get started writing up the issues and proposing resolutions.   In deciding how to order things we should bear in mind:      o some quick wins would be good    o take the ones on which others depend early    o take the unknowns that could have a big impact early    o take the ones that facilitate the process early    o cluster related issues together    So here is a possible clustering:      Editorial - quick fix in the errata    Out of scope - not our job    WG Global - terminology, document structure etc    Core model - resources, uri's, anon resources, reification, ...    XML Syntax - all pure syntax related issues    Schema - all schema related issues    Vocabulary - issues relating to things which can be built on the core                 model, e.g. containers    Relationships - relationships with other specifications    Misc - other    My list of things I'd like to see volunteers to begin work on includes:      o proposing updates to the errata documents    o proposing a glossary    o taking a first look at integrating schema data types    o taking a first look at issues raised by the DAML group    o proposing a working model for resources, uri's, entities,      fragment id's etc    Brian        

        This is my usual weekly call for agenda items for the telecon.  My plan is   to focus this weeks telecon on the editors meeting I was asked to call:      2002-06-28#2  bwm  get editors together, review contents of documents    Brian

And why stop at numbers? ;-)      This sets my antenae twitching.    One of the problems with the earlier M&S document's formal model was that (at   least in my interpretation of it) the use of platonic statements, platonic   resources etc led to all sorts of horrible confusion.    This is one of the reasons I felt the need for a model theory and why I   preferred to have it based on n-triples - because that was clearly a concete   syntax.  I've bought the idea that the graph is also a concrete syntax, so using   that is fine.    I personally would be real nervous if we were losing the clarity of that   distinction between a concrete syntax and what it means.  We'll be back to   graphs containing resources and questions about what exactly is a resource,   which so far, we have brilliantly managed not to need to answer.    Brian

This is on the critical path for   request for PR.    We can still make minor editorial changes after sending the request,   though I'd much rather not, but I need need responses to all comments   before it goes out.    Brian        

      Folks,    For those of you who have not seen it, Peter Patel-Schneider has posted   another idea for handling data types to RDF interest.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Nov/0141.html    I suggest folks take a look at it, and to be inclusive of the community,   have any follow up discussion on that mailing list.  If someone could   summarize back to RDFCore that would be helpful.    Brian

        I have partially reviewed the CC/PP last call WD:       http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20030325/    and propose the following comments for consideration by the RDFCore WG.    1. RDFCore considers all of these comments to be editorial and does not   expect that any changes made in consequence will result in another last call.    2.  RDFCore is pleased by the replacement of the tutorial on RDF with a   reference to the tutorial being developed by RDFCore.  It notes that   CC/PP's normative references are to RDF M&S and the candidate rec RDF   Schema.  We suggest that CC/PP update the normative references to refer to   the RDFCore last call WD's.  Should the CC/PP WG prefer not to change these   references, we suggest a brief note informing the reader that primer   describes a more recent revision of RDF specs.    3. Section 4.1.1.1 Values described by URIs    [[A common requirement is to identify some resource using a URI as the   value of a CC/PP attribute (e.g. a device type or an applicable DTD or schema).    In such cases, the attribute value is represented as an RDF resource having   the designated URI. In RDF/XML, this may be represented as an   <rdf:Description> element in a property element, or an rdf:resource XML   attribute of a property element; e.g. ...]]    In the example given the value of the RDF property is the resource   identified by the given URI, not the URI used to identify it.    We suggest:    [[A common requirement is that the value of a CC/PP attribute is some   resource identified by a URI Reference, e.g. a device type or an applicable   DTD or schema.   In RDF/XML, this may be represented as an   <rdf:Description> element in a property element, or an rdf:resource XML   attribute of a property element; e.g. ...]]    4. Section 4.1.1.2 Text values    [[A text value is a string that is used to describe or identify some   specific CC/PP attribute value.]]    We find the language here confusing.  It seems to say that the CC/PP   attribute value is a different thing (that is described or identified by)   the text value.  Yet in 4.1 it states:    [[All CC/PP attributes should be defined with values that can be treated as   one of the simple or complex data types discussed later.]]    which suggests that the text value and CC/PP attribute value are the same   thing.    We suggest that the specification be modified to describe the following   concepts:      o the lexical space    o the RDF Literal value space    o XML Schema value space    o the CC/PP Application value space    CC/PP is using RDF plain literals to represent datatype values.  Whilst RDF   does not treat plain literals as a datatype, CC/PP may consider the value   space of RDF plain literals to be either a sequence of characters if no   xml:lang is in scope, or a pair of a sequence of characters and a lang tag   if an xml:lang is in scope.    We suggest that the CC/PP spec should define the mapping from the RDF value   space to the CC/PP Application value space for the CC/PP value types text,   integer and rational.  It should specify whitespace processing and what to   do with the lang tag (ignore it?) if present.    We suggest that the text be modified, especially in the use of the term   'value', to be clear about which value space is being referred to.    5. Section 4    There are several phrases in this section of the form "?datetype values are   based on ...".  The specification should be more precise, e.g., for an   CC/PP integer value:      o the string part of the RDF literal must be a member of the lexical   space of xsd:int.    o the value is the integer that xsd:int maps that string to    6. Section 4.1.1.4    [[o 1/2 -- this is equivalent to decimal 0.5]]    This may be potentially troublesome in the future.  It makes a statement   about the CC/PP Application value spaces that could contradict a future   fully defined rational datatype defined by XML Schema.  It would be better   simply to omit the statement of equivalence.    7. Section 4.1.1.4    The regular expression defining the lexical form isn't quite right.  It   doesn't allow a leading + or -.    8. Section 4.2    [[are combined to yield the attribute name URI:    http://www.w3.org/2002/11/08-ccpp-client#type    ]]    That's not a URI, its a URI Reference.    9. Section 4.3    [[Appendix B to this document contains an RDF schema with which all CC/PP   profiles must conform, and Appendix C contains an example of a vocabulary   definition schema.]]    RDF defines no notion of conformance to a schema, nor does it really define   vocabularies.  Suggest:    [[Appendix B to this document contains an RDF schema describing terms for   use in CC/PP profiles.  Appendix C contains an example Schema describing a   CC/PP vocabulary.]]    10. Appendix B.3    [[       <rdfs:Class rdf:about='&ns-ccpp;integer'>       <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Integer value</rdfs:label>       <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource='&ns-rdfs;Literal'/>       <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">         This class defines the CC/PP integer data type.       </rdfs:comment>       <rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource=           'http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#integer'/>     </rdfs:Class>  ]]    We have a number of concerns about the rdfs:comment:       o the class does not 'define' anything.     o datatypes in RDF, which CC/PP is not using yet, but may in the future,   are not classes - they follow the XML Schema datatyping model, having a   lexical space, a value space, a mapping etc.     o there is a confusion between the RDF literal representing the value   and CC/PP application value itself    We suggest this comment (and others similar) be rephrased as:    [[This is the class of RDF Literals that represent CC/PP Application   integer values.]]    This phrase has been chosen to permit the use of the RDF datatype machinery   at a future date.    11. Appendix B.3    We note that a ccpp:anyURI is defined in the schema, but not mentioned in   section 4.    12. Appendix B.3    We note that the appendix contains no description of CC/PP tokens,   described in section 4.

        Patrick,    Thank you for this suggestion.    A couple of questions:     - is it necessary to drop the definition of the xml:literal datatype?     - What triple does    <rdf:Description>    <ex:foo rdf:parseType="Literal"><em><foo></em></ex:foo>  </rdf:Description>    generate?     - What triple does    <rdf:Description>    <ex:foo rdf:parseType="Literal"><ex:foo ex:b='b' ex:a='a' /></ex:foo>  </rdf:Description>    generate?

      Dan,    Your proposal looks like a good idea.  Can we combine the two.  The strict   answer to the issue is that no, we are not going to change from URI's to   pairs.  And then add the guidance.    A small nit type question:  Jena does store URI's internally as pairs and   allows a client app to specify the namespace and the local name:        Property p = m.createProperty(namespace, localname);    When it comes to serializing such a property the serializer has been told   where to split by the application.  Are you suggesting that this should   still throw an exception when the namespace does not end in an appropriate   character?

Of course it can.  If it can assert that a seller service exists, surely  it can equally well assert that a buyer service exists.  It doesn't know  the difference.    Brian        

        The purpose of this talk is to set the scene for the talks that will   follow.  It introduces the concept of the semantic web and outlines its   potential impact.  It presents an overview of the work we are doing in   semantic web architecture, tools and applications.        

        Thank you Pat.  I normally prefer to keep doc's in review stable, but at  this stage, and with Pat highlighting recent changes in RED, I think its  sensible to update in place.

Two points should be made:       oThe descriptions of the relations on the value spaces of Schema      datatypes are normative for schema processing but are advisory      for other applications.       oThe WG is aware that some of our primitive datatypes have      values that could reasonably be identified with values from      other primitive datatypes.  For 1.0, at least, we chose to      make those values (artificially?) unequal *for schema      processing purposes*.  This decision gets occasional discussion;     some would like to change it.  The WG hasn't yet thought out      all the ramifications of such a change.    Personally, I see nothing wrong if other applications choose to  treat such values as identical.  I *hope* that the WG will decide  to make such a change for schema processing, but there are many  numeric datatypes for which the corresponding ramifications are  more complicated, and it may take awhile to get them sorted out.  --   Dave Peterson  SGMLWorks!, for IDEAlliance    davep@iit.edu        

        I propose to cancel this weeks telecon and schedule another for 12 Mar   2004, if needed.    I would like to get moving on comments on the TAG architecture document.    Jan - are you still up for reviewing?  Can we aim to get other comments   in by the end of this week and agreement by email next week?    Brian        

        I'm not seeing anything on the agenda for a telecon this week, so I'm   proposing to not have a telecon.    Brian        

        This is one of many possible test cases to clarify whether RDF/XML is   really layered on XML, and we whether we expect standard XML processing to   apply:    RDF/XML    <?xml version="1.0"?>  <!DOCTYPE rdf:RDF [     <!ENTITY test   "Some test text">]>    <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"            xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">     <rdf:Description>       <rdfs:label>&test;</rdfs:labelL>     </rdf:Description>  </rdf:RDF>    N-TRIPLES      _:a <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Some test text" .    Yes/No?    Brian

        Jeremy,    Remembering DanC's advice from a short time ago, the point of last call is   identify issues that folks can't live with.  If you are going to propose   even discussion of a *huge* change, perhaps you might care to suggest why a   huge change is necessary.

        I'm off on hols immediately after todays telecon, for approx two   weeks.  Eric has agreed to step in as chair in my absence as Danbri is   otherwise engaged.  I will not be checking my email whilst I'm away.    Brian        

      Thanks Pat!    It would be good to get this published.  We said we would allow a week  to give folks time to review publication candidates.  We have less than  that before Friday.  However, if folks have reviewed it to their  satisfaction by then, I'd see no point in delaying.    So unless there are objections, I may ask at Friday's telecon  whether we are happy to publish.  Anyone in the WG can veto that by  saying that they have not had time to review it, either by email  or at the telecon, in which case we'll delay another week.  If we  can review it by Friday and decide to publish that would be good.    Regarding the missing lemma's appendix, I'm not sure its absence is  a show stopper.  Would it be ok to hold off on that till the next  version?  Lets publish based on what we have, otherwise we get into  "there just one more bit I'd like to add" syndrome.

      We have some students who are working for the next six months on some   collaboration tools inspired by Jema.  They are currently employees of   HP.  They would like to observe Friday's RDFCore telecon.  If there are any   objections, please let me know.    Brian

I agree that doesn't look good either, which would suggest we drop the lang   tag from the abstract syntax, but that invalidates the Nokia data, which is   undesirable.    I'm suggesting the WG consider which is the least damaging option we   have.  Patrick: comment?    Brian        

        I meant to send this to RDFCore but messed up the distribution list.  Sorry folks.    Brian    -----Forwarded Message-----    From: Brian McBride <bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com>  Subject: I18N Comments  Date: 14 Jul 2003 15:09:15 +0100    During the summing up on last Friday's telecon, I asked whether folks  felt we had identified a show stopper problem with RDFCore's I18N  support.  Pat said he wasn't sure what the problem was; others agreed.   Patrick said he saw issues but didn't see them as show stoppers.    However, some folks had dropped off the call as a result of a comms  failure and didn't have a chance to respond.  Please could you respond  to this email, if you feel such a showstopper has been identified and  can describe what it is.    Brian        

        Any suggestions for agenda items for a telecon this week.    Brian

I would be willing to accept the syntax editor's assurance that he can get   section 2 into shape for last call.  I'd also be willing to find time to   assist Dave with the wordsmithing if that would be helpful, though there   may be others who would be both willing and able to do a better job.

      I was wondering whether there would be too many folks on vacation due  to July 4th holiday for a telecon next week to be viable.    If you are planning not to be available, please could you let me know.    Brian        

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  On   my list of possibles I have:       o approve datatype test cases     o issues arising after publication - eds - are there any you need to discuss     o the last deliverable    Brian        

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.    I am considering cancelling as I'm not sure we have anything that needs   telecon time.  Do let me know if you have stuff I haven't thought of yet.    Brian

Oops - re-reading the example, I wrote nonsense.  The example is wrong.  It should read something like:                          advert123 role buyer   and  thereExists ?X  advert123 description ?X                        ?X        product      roses        thereExists ?Y  ?X        minQuantitiy ?Y                        ?Y        units        kg                        ?Y        value        100    I also think the role really should be a property of ?X, but I've left  that for now.    ?Y simply denotes 100Kg.    Or it could have been:                          advert123 role buyer   and  thereExists ?X  advert123 description ?X                        ?X        product      roses        thereExists ?Y  ?X        quantity     ?Y                        ?Y        units        kg                        ?Y        minvalue        100    in which case ?Y could represent a range with an unbounded upper limit.

Maybe its not so bad as I first thought.  If we decide that the answer to   test case A is yes and the answer to test case C is no, then we will need   some magic in the model theory to handle rdf:object (per my recent   post).  I guess it would mean applying the same magic to the ordinal   properties.      >I don't believe that any of the proposed global datatyping solutions   >(ever) work  >with containers.  >  >Hence I think:  >  >+ test case A is a choice (the group seems minded to say that the entailment  >holds - I disagree but not strongly).  >  >+ containers cannot contain globally typed literals (i.e. the literals are  >either self-denoting or untyped)    Hmm, the question is which.  The later seems to imply, if one puts a   literal in a container, then one doesn't know what it denotes.    Brian

The denotation of an XML Literal is an octet sequence, as  defined by the xml canonicalization spec, see the note in:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-XMLLiteral    Pat, does this suggest deleting from section 3    [[  This terminology is deliberately agnostic as to whether or not XML data  is considered to be identical to a character string; note however that  the XML data values corresponding to well-typed XML literals are in  precise 1:1 correspondence with the XML literal strings of such  literals.  ]]    The statement you make is correct, in that the terminology is agnostic,  but its also unnecessary and maybe a little misleading.

      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-validating-embedded-rdf    Issue: RDF has an "open grammar, which is harder to validate simply     (and nigh on impossible to do properly with DTDs). - Syntax     validation within the context of RDF embedded in other XML grammars     would be easier if the RDF syntax were only of the 'Fixed-Schema'     variety, see     [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Apr/0346.html  ]. Currently, the propertyElt construct, and abbreviated forms of     RDF are of the 'Schema-follows-data' variety.       Proposal:       The WG resolves to postpone this issue for later consideration on     the grounds that it is out of scope of its current charter to     change the current RDF/XML syntax to the extent necessary to address     this issue.   The WG notes however that validation may be helped with     various submitted (non-normative) XML schemas for RDF/XML pointed to at     present in the editors draft at     http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Schemas    (Thanks to DaveB for the proposal - wordsmithed a bit by Brian)    Brian

        Reading through this, the comment I see is a request that the syntax doc   contain add a section 10 to discuss embedding RDF in SVG.  I note that SVG   has created a very nice slot for inserting RDF (and any other) metadata   into SVG :)  I also note an offer from Chris to help draft such a section.    This looks to me as a nice to have, but not essential, and given the   comment is very late, I don't think we have an obligation to accept it.    However, if the syntax editor, (or possibly the primer editor) were   willing, we might indicate to Chris that if he were to provide us with a   draft, we would try to fit include it.  Another possible home would be the FAQ.    I'm open to advice from our team contact or elsewhere, but I suggest:       o we don't accept this as a last call comment - too late and not substantive     o we invite Chris to prepare a draft on how to embed RDF in SVG     o the syntax editor or primer editor have discretion to use the material     o if it doesn't go in a rec track doc we'll put it in the FAQ, or   possibly Chris could put it in the SVG FAQ and we could link to it - ah -   google doesn't find a W3C FAQ for SVG    Comments?

        DRAFT for information of RDFCore    In reviewing the Owl Reference last call WD at       http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-ref-20030331/    for RDFCore, I noticed the following comments that were not directly   related to RDFCore's interests.    -----------------------    3. Classes  [[  When in this document we use wording such as "a class of individuals ..",   this should be read as the "a class with a class extension containing   individuals ...".  ]]    typo: "should be read as the ...                          ^^^^^^^  -----------------------    [[  OWL Full allows the freedom of RDF Schema: a class may act as an instance   of another (meta)class (the same holds for properties).  ]]    The phrase "the same holds for properties" is unclear.  Does it mean       properties may act as an instance of class    or       properties may act as an instance of another (meta) property    I think the former is the only one that makes sense.  This confused me and   doesn't seem to add much so I suggest dropping the phrase in brackets.    ---------------------------    3.1    [[  The other five forms of class descriptions are represented as anonymous   instances of owl:Class (a blank node with the rdf:type owl:Class).  ]]    Two things wrong with this.  If my understanding is correct then the class   descriptions are represented by sets of triples, not by a single node.  The   single node represents the class, not its description.    Secondly, nodes don't have types; nodes can be the subject of a   triple.  Perhaps:    [[  The other five forms of class descriptions consist of a set of RDF triples   in which a blank node represents the class being described.  That blank   node has an rdf:type property whose value is owl:Class.  ]]    -----------------------------  [[  The class extension of owl:Thing is the set of all individuals in the   domain of discourse.  ]]    First use of the term "domain of discourse".  Is this part of the   vocabulary you expect your readers (users of the owl language) to have?    I suggest you just say its the set of all individuals, define the term or   import a definition of the term.    -----------------------------    [[  NOTE: owl:Nothing is not included in OWL Lite.  ]]    I'm not sure what that means.  Does this mean it is not predefined or does   it mean that any reference to it will render a document not in OWL   Lite?  If the latter:    [[  NOTE: An OWL Lite document may not refer to owl:Nothing.  ]]    -------------------------------    3.1.1    Is there a restriction that there may be only one enumeration for a class   description?    What happens with:    <owl:Class rdf:ID="c">     <owl:oneOf rdf:parseType="Collection">       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#a1"/>       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#a2"/>     </...  </...  <owl:Class rdf:about="#c">     <owl:oneOf rdf:parseType="Collection">       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#b1"/>       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#b2"/>       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#b3"/>     </...  </...    ----------------------------    There is no discussion of inconsistency.  This is an omission from the   document that should be fixed.    ----------------------------    3.1.2.1    [[  To see why this is so, observe that the owl:allValuesFrom constraint   demands that all values of P belong to class P, and if no such values   exist, the constraint is trivially true.  ]]    Typo - I don't think you mean "belongs to class P".    -----------------------------------    3.1.2.2    [[  Note that an owl:minCardinality of one or more means that a value for the   property is required of any instance of the class.  ]]    I find the language confusing - whether to interpret 'any' as an   existential or a universal quantifier.  Clearer would be:    [[  Note that an owl:minCardinality of one or more means that all instances of   the class must have a value for the property.  ]]    -------------------------------------    3.1.3    [[  owl:complementOf is analogous to logical negation, but restricted to   individuals only.  ]]    The language here is not clear.  How do you logically negate an individual?    <aside>it occurs to me that is a question that often may occur to WG's   processing last call comments</aside>    The document might be trying to say that you can only take the compliment   of a class (or class description I'm not sure which) that contains only   individuals.  Or it might be saying that the compliment will only contain   individuals not in the complimented class, but will not contain things that   are not individuals.    I now think it means the latter, but on first read thought it meant the   former.  Needs clarifying, or possibly removing.    ---------------------------------------    [[  4. Properties    OWL distinguishes between two types of properties.  ]]    There are frequent references it he document to built-in properties.  Is   this a third type of property with specific characteristics?    ----------------------------------    4.1    [[  For a property one can define (multiple) rdfs:domain axiom.  ]]    typo:                                                ^^^^^^    ----------------------------------    4.3    [["functional" >For ...]]    Typo.    ----------------------------------    4.3 owlInverseFunctionalProperty    [[  If a property is declared to be inverse-functional, the a range value  ]]    Typo: "the a range"    ---------------------------------    [[  Symmetric properties should have identical domains and ranges to make sense.  ]]    Language?

[[  In RDF/XML, the type of a literal is specified by an "rdf:datatype" attribute.  ]]    Similarly:    [[  When using datatypes, please note that even if the range of a property is   declared to be of a certain datatype, RDF still requires a rdf:datatype   attribute in a statement about this property, otherwise it is treated as a   plain literal.  ]]    [[  When using datatypes, please note that even if a property is defined to   have a range of a certain datatype, RDF/XML still requires that the   datatype be specified each time the property is used.  ]]    -------------------------------------  6.1 Datatypes    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype of which the   value is recommended to be one of the following:  ...    * The RDF datatype rdf:XMLLiteral.  ]]    The RDF datatype is not the value of the attribute, its the string           http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral    Suggest:    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype of which the   value is recommended to be one of the following:  ...    * The URIREF for the datatype rdf:XMLLiteral  ]]    ----------------------------------------    [[  * The primitive datatype  xsd:string, plus the following datatypes derived   from xsd:strong:  ]]    Typo: "derived from xsd:strong"    ---------------------------------------    7.1 Annotations    Should any of the following also be annotation properties, as they seem to   have no effect on the semantics:       o priorVersion     o backwardCompatibleWith     o incompatibileWith     o deprecatedClass     o deprecatedProperty    ------------------------------------------    owl:hasValue is described as taking either an individual or a data value as   its value.  There is a note OWL Lite does not support hasValue.    Given that OWL DL requires a separation between object properties and data   valued properties, please confirm that OWL DL supports owl:hasValue.  I   suggest that since this caused me to pause, that the note be extended to   specifically state that OWL DL does support it, perhaps because, as a built   in property, it is exempt from the restriction.    ------------------------------    In 3.1.2.2    [[  A restriction containing an owl:minCardinality constraint describes a class   of all individuals that have at least N distinct range values (individuals   or data values) for the property concerned, where N is the range value of   the cardinality constraint.  ]]    I presume that this means "semantically distinct" as mentioned elsewhere,   but since it is specifically called out elsewhere, the omission here   suggests that syntactic distinction is what is meant here.    -------------------------------    In 3.2    [[  For example, the following class axiom declares the URI reference Human to   be an OWL class:  ]]    Two things wrong with this.  'Human' isn't the URI reference, its   '#Human'.  But more importantly, '#Human' isn't an owl:Class; it names the   class.    -------------------------------    in 3.2.2    [[  This denotes indeed the same set of individuals as the previous axiom.  ]]    The term denotes is confusing here and its not clear what 'this' refers   to.  The text is liable to confuse the notion of class and its   extension.  Suggest:    [[  This axiom defines a class with exactly the same instances as the previous   axiom.  ]]    --------------------------------    4.1    [[  The rdfs:domain restrictions are global, meaning that they cannot be used   for an individual for which the class is not explicitly included in the   domain restriction.  ]]    Unparsable.

      Aaron,    The thing to bear in mind about this submission is that these  were not my words.  They were the words (with some HP specific  stuff removed) of my colleagues who are using RDF in the manner  described.  This input is from real developers.

I think the idea here is that there will be URI's  denoting specific services.  My colleagues are   interpretting a node with a URI to be denoting   such a service.  It would be wrong to match a different  service.    When an anonymous node is specified, then no such constraint  exists.  Thus a processor would process these two instances  differently.    > And I see  > nothing about a URI that licenses you to assume that there is  > only such thing.    Oh we really do need this model theory don't we.  I tend to think  of a URI as identifying one thing, and one thing only, but that way  lies a philosphical debate on the nature of 'one'.

What's the difference? In both you're looking  > for something with these properties.    The difference is that when a URI is specified the assumption is  that someone, somewhere has defined a 'well known' name for this  service.    The essence of this issue seems to involve the idea that the  act of naming something in the internet is somehow, special.  That if a processor is told that something has URI ISBN-12345  or whatever, it had better not match that with anything that  it does not 'know' is named ISBN-12345.  On the other hand,  if a node is not named, then it can be matched with anything  that matches its properties.    I'm not sure that standard FOL captures this.  FOL is built  around a conceptual model where there can be many interpretations  for statements in the FOL.  But that is not the situation we  are in here.  We have one interpretation - its a mapping to   the world out there.  Intuitively I feel that makes a difference.  That makes naming special.    Brian        

      I asked my colleagues if they had any use cases for anon resources  that might help us with this issue.  What follows is an (edited)  response I received.      Consider the case of describing services and being able to place adverts and  offers for such services. For example here is an (massively simplified) advert  requesting a service (all uri prefixes dropped for clarity):     #advert123 :role "buyer";              :description [:product :roses;                            :quantity [:units :kg; :minValue "100"]].    And here is a supplier who can offer a range of services:    #advert456 :role "seller";              :description [:product :roses;                            :quantity [:units :kg; :maxValue "500"]].     Neither is a specific service. The "buyer" advert is essentially a template. The  seller is offering the existence of at least one service that matches a template  - he may have many actual instances on offer which differ by location, qos etc.    Here is an offer of specific service:     #offer890 :inResponseTo #advert123;             :instanceOf   #advert456;             :service #service42     #service42 :product :roses;              :quantity [:units :kg; :value "200"]];              :deliveryTime [:units :days; :value "2"];              :deliveryMethod "TNT";              etc              .     Now. If we don't have anonymous nodes then we have the following problems.     (1) In the seller advert it would appear that the seller is only advertising a  single specific (but under-specified) service, #anon12345 or whatever, which  would be hard to distinguish from an actual service instance like #service42.     (2) Similarly in the buyer advert instead of describing a template, giving the  service a URI would make it appear that I am looking for a specific service with  that URI.      This is clearly similar to DanC's book buying example.    Brian

      For completeness of the archive, the document referenced as       http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/users/phayes/w3-rdf-mt-current-draft.html    in       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Dec/0082.html    is attached here.

        I was reading through the feature synopis       http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-features-20020729/#s3.2    where I found:    [[*  sameClassAs: Two classes may be stated to be the same (i.e., they may   be stated to be different names for the same set of individuals)...]]    I thought, that's odd, that's not how RDFS classes work, given the natural   interpretation of "sameAs".    In the reference:       http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-ref-20021112/#sameClassAs-def    I find:    [[ Each owl:sameClassAs element asserts that C is equivalent to the   class-expression in the element (ie. C and all the class-expression must   have the same instances);]]    which is a bit more circumspect, introducing the concept of   "equivalence".  Could it be that classes with the same membership are   equivalent but not necessarily identical?  Is class equivalence defined   anywhere?  Is this the definition of class equivalence?    I wonder if this really is a reference document where I'd expect to find a   definition of what sameClassAs means and check that abstract.  Its a bit   bland about the purpose of this document.  Oh, and in passing I notice that   the status section says this WD is the first version of the OWL Spec, but   there is also a link to a previous version.    In the reference under class expressions, I find:    [[Each class expression either refers to a named class, namely the class   that is identified by the URI, or implicitly defines an anonymous class,   respectively the class that contains exactly the enumerated elements ...]    That "the class that contains ..." suggests that there is only one such   class.  Hmm, could scotch previous hypothesis, but maybe this is only a   miswrite and it should be "a class that contains ...".    And then, also in the reference I find:    [[owl:Class, a subclass of rdfs:Class]]    which suggests that owl classes do behave like rdfs classes, unless there   can only ever be one owl class with a given membership.    In the guide the notion of class equivalence is used, but not defined:       http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-guide-20021104/#sameClassAs1    Dare I brave the semantics doc?  I don't grok that stuff, but maybe I'll   find the answer to my question.    Owl lite does indeed seem to have an EquivalentClass(...).  But its hard to   tell what it means, because I'm looking for the omission of an axiom and   I'm not sure I'm understanding this.  Looking at the semantics stuff I find   some text explaining the relation between RDF and OWL:  +1 to the authors.       http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-semantics-20021108/rdfs.html#5.1    [[  All of the OWL vocabulary is defined on the 'OWL universe', which is a   collection of RDFS classes that are intended to circumscribe the domain of   application of the OWL vocabulary: owl:Thing, owl:Class and owl:Property.   The RDFS class extension of owl:Thing comprises the individuals of the OWL   universe. The RDFS class extension of owl:Class comprises the classes of   the OWL universe. The RDFS class extension of owl:Property comprises the   properties of the OWL universe.    There are two different styles of using OWL. In the more free-wheeling   style, called OWL/Full here, these three classes are identified with their   RDFS counterparts. In OWL/Full, as in RDFS, resources can be both an   individual and a class, or, in fact, even an individual, a class, and a   property. In the more restrictive style, called OWL/DL here, these three   classes are different from their RDFS counterparts and, moreover, pairwise   disjoint.  ]]    My first reading of that was that it said the pair of classes rdfs:Class   and owl:Class are disjoint in OWL/DL.  But that would be madness, since   owl:Class is a subclass of rdfs:Class.  I think this means:    [[In the more restrictive style, called OWL/DL here, owl:Thing, owl:Class   and owl:Property are different from their RDFS counterparts.  Moreover,   owl:Thing, owl:Class and owl:Property are pairwise disjoint.  ]]    Which is interesting in its own right, as it means that OWL/DL can't handle   datatypes that are both classes and interpretation properties, which I'd   been assuming was ok.  But doesn't answer my question.    Giving up at this point, I have the following conclusions:    o different parts of the text are suggestive of different assumptions by   their authors at the time of writing.  this confusion may be more   widespread than just the items I have highlighted.    o given the significant use that the reference document is making of the   notion of class equivalence, I suggest a 'first class' definition of the   term, rather than hiding it in a parenthetical comment.    o text somewhere (the guide?) explaining the relationship between owl and   rdf concepts for the not so technical like me would be helpful.    o if my assumption that owl:sameClassAs means has same members as, but does   not mean they are identical (i.e. indistinguishable), then I find the term   owl:sameClassAs confusing.  owl:equivalentClassAs would suite the rest of   the terminology better.  owl:sameMembersAs would be more descriptive.    o the abstract for the reference document might be more specific about the   document's purpose.    Sorry for the ramble - I was trying to convey to the authors/editors the   experience of using the docs for a particular purpose.    Brian

What decision do you think the WG has to make?  M&S says:      For a single collection resource there may be at most one triple    whose predicate is any given element of Ord.    Members of Ord are not constrained to only apply to containers.  There is no cardinality restriction stated for Ord in general.  No issue has been raised proposing such a constraint.     >   > >         rdf:li elements as typed nodes - a bizarre case  > >         but handled regularly  >   > I'm not sure that this is specified in the M&S (perhaps this  > should be an issue) but it's certainly not a good idea to make  > something both a class and a property. Let's not have a test  > case that does this, please.     I suggest that a test case is need for this so that it is  clear how an <rdf:li> as a typed node should be processed.  Is it  an error, or should it be translated to <rdf:_nnn>, or does it  define a node with type rdf:li?    I'm open minded about whether this should be an error or should  be legal but strange.  I had two reasons for suggesting that it  should be legal and processed as I suggested:      o a general principle that one should not rule things illegal      just because they look a little strange - someone might come      up with an unforseen use for it.      o special cases are best avoided.  As this case seems to do no      harm then why go to the trouble of outlawing it.  This way      the XSLT to transform <rdf:li> to rdf:_nnn is more      straightforward, for example.    However, I do seek the WG's advice on how this might best be handled.    > Especially since rdf:li is a  > special syntactic element -- I do not think we should allow it  > to be used in this way.    I don't follow your reasoning there, but +1 for its an error.    Brian

We got to the point in our analysis where it seemed like it came down to a   choice of which functionality was more important, the entailment you   suggested or the Cannes entailment.    My understanding is that we decided to ask the community which of these   they thought was more important.  This we are doing.  After one of the two   weeks allowed for feedback have elapsed, there indications are that the   segment of the community which is responding is favoring untidy.    Brian

A case that arose recently involves a statement and its reification:       _:a    foo:bar        _:l"lit" .     _:stmt rdf:type       rdf:Statement .     _:stmt rdf:subject   _:a .     _:stmt rdf:predicate foo:bar .     _:stmt rdf:object    _l:"lit" .

What is an interpretation of the  identity of a resource?  How can one tell whether the identity  of a resource has been 'reinterpreted'.    [...]    Can we make this a little clearer.    Let's assume for the purposes of argument, that I did an http get  on http://www.ietf.org at the first instant of the year 2000 and  the first instant of the year 2001, that no error occurred and that  the sequence of characters returned was not the same on the two  occasions.    Is it true that any time invariant property of       urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org    is also a time invariant property of       urn:duri:2000:http://www.ietf.org    The two dates are intentionally different.    e.g. if the creation date of:       urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org    is D, then is the creation date of       urn:duri:2000:http://www.ietf.org    also D.

This gets into more muddy water because the core of web architecture  isn't very well defined.    Is it possible to argue that:       http://mycollege.edu/students/Mary    does indeed name Mary, and what you get when you do an HTTP GET  on that URL is a representation of Mary?    Leaving aside, however sorting out what the properties of resources are,  I wouldn't write the RDF example above that way, as it is at best,  likely to confuse.  Better would be:    <rdf:RDF>     <rdf:Description about="http://mycollege.edu/courses/6.001">       <s:students>         <rdf:Bag>           <rdf:li rdf:parseType="Resource">             <foo:homepage resource="http://mycollege.edu/students/Amy"/>           </rdf:li>           <rdf:li rdf:parseType="Resource">             <foo:homepage resource="http://mycollege.edu/students/Tim"/>           </rdf:li>           <rdf:li rdf:parseType="Resource">             <foo:homepage resource="http://mycollege.edu/students/Mary"/>           </rdf:li>         </rdf:Bag>       </s:students>     </rdf:Description>  </rdf:RDF>    which inserts extra resources to 'represent' the students as different  resources from their home pages.    Thus RDF does not need tbd; it has enough machinery to  handle the indirection required.  Were there other applications you had  in mind?    Brian

      This message is aimed primarily at those who abstained at last weeks straw   poll on datatypes.    Is there anything that can be done to help you form a view on the relative   merits of the two proposals?    Brian        

        Hi Folks,    This is a heads up that it looks like the PR meeting may be this Wed.   I've had an invitation to attend but not had it confirmed yet.    Brian

            -------- Original Message --------  Subject: Request for PR for XML 1.1  Resent-Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2003 12:39:40 -0400 (EDT)  Resent-From: chairs@w3.org  Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2003 11:39:03 -0500  From: Paul Grosso <pgrosso@arbortext.com>  <jcowan@reutershealth.com>        The XML Core WG requests publication of the following document as a W3C  Proposed Recommendation:  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/10/PR-xml11-20031010/Overview.html    A review version with diffs noted is at  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/10/PR-xml11-20031010/PR-xml11-20031010-review.html    The URL cited above is for the most recent Member-only version of the  specification, dated 10 October 2003.    The Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.1 specification was published as a  Candidate Recommendation on 10 October 2002. The list of issues that were  raised and discussed can be found at (member-only):  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/03/xml11-doc/xml11-cr-comments.html    And a document containing the comments received from other WGs and the  public as well as the WG's final disposition of those comments may be found  at:  http://www.w3.org/XML/2003/06/xml11-cr-doc.html    In general, the XML Core WG has not received any replies from commenters  saying that our responses were inadequate. We did receive several replies  saying our answers were fine. And the document being sent to PR contains the  changes that were made to accommodate these comments.    However, the XML Core WG wants to highlight the fact that our CR request at  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2002JulSep/0128.html said:    <quote>  The removal of direct representation of control characters in the range  #x7F-#x9F represents a change in well-formedness. That is, well-formed  XML 1.0 documents which contain these characters do not become  well-formed XML 1.1 documents simply by changing their version number.  Occurrences of control characters must also be converted to numeric  character references.    As a criterion for exiting CR, the XML Core WG will collect evidence  substantiating (or contradicting) our opinion that:    1) converting characters in the #x7F-#x9F range to numeric      character references while updating XML 1.0 documents to XML 1.1 does      not represent a significant obstacle to adoption of XML 1.1;  2) there are no significant scenarios where converting characters      in the #x7F-#x9F range to numeric character references is impractical or      impossible;  3) that the benefits of this change to the proper detection of      character encoding represent a significant improvement in      interoperability.  </quote>    This is reflected by Issue Tobin-01 in our Issues doc at  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2003/03/xml11-doc/xml11-cr-comments.html#issue-Tobin-01    <quote>  Summary: Is requiring the escaping of C1 control characters worth it?    After much discussion spanning many telcons, we continue to have WG members  with strong views on both sides of the issue. During our May 28  telcon[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-core-wg/2003AprJun/0182.h  tml] (member only), we took a vote in which we had 4 members for, 4 against,  and 4 abstentions.  The chair declared UNRESOLVABLE LACK of CONSENSUS. We therefore close the  issue in favor of the status quo, but will highlight this issue in our PR  request.

The XML Core WG set a goal of having at least 2  successful implementations of the specification. As of today, we know of at  least 4 implementations.    However, the XML Core WG wants to highlight the lack of support for the  character normalization checking feature. Only one non-commercial  implementation of this feature has been developed and, while it demonstrates  the feasibility of the implementation, it does not demonstrate support from  vendors and does not satisfy our CR exit criteria. The XML Core WG however  decided to leave it in the specification because it is an optional feature  and was included at the request of the I18N WG.    See the implementation report at:  http://www.w3.org/XML/2002/09/xml11-implementation      SCHEDULE    We propose that the PR period for XML 1.1 to last for eight weeks from  publication.

Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be   served,  received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with  HTML. XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for  interoperability with both SGML and HTML.    Status of this document  -----------------------  This section describes the status of this document at the time of its  publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current  W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be  found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.    This document is a Proposed Recommendation of the W3C. This document is  based on the feedback from implementers on the XML 1.0 Candidate  Recommendation dated 15 October 2002, and the XML Core Working Group  believes that the specification is now stable and ready for the Advisory  Committee review.    Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the  W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or  obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this  document as other than work in progress.

W3C  Advisory Committee Representatives may also send comments, visible only to  the Team or to the Membership, through the form available in the Call for  Review. The review period extends to four weeks after the approval of PR.  [Publication Team: please change this to a hard date before final  publication.] Reviewers are encouraged to read the XHTML with color-coded  revision indicators; this version highlights each substantive change  separating XML 1.1 from XML 1.0.    This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing, widely  used international text processing standard (Standard Generalized Markup  Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and corrected) for use on the World  Wide Web.

        Folks have done a good job of picking up the loose comments identified by   Jan.  Thanks to all.

Frank's prompted him for  reasons why; this is to do with nonopaqueness issue of URLs. No response  from EricP but I think this is captured in other discussion]    Frank??    I have a recollection of seeing some traffic on this but can't find it in   the archive.  If I missed it sorry Frank.  Frank, do you think anything   more than a "closed given lack of response" is needed?    And on the vocabulary document:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0355.html  [DanC on member and collection; recall this being discussed, can't find  a closing message]    Danbri??      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0384.html  [late, another question about creating a class for rdfs:Schema.

At this point of time we do not have a mechanism  >robust enough to standardize on global datatyping.    Sergey,    I interpret these comments in the light of your preference for tidy literals.    Not having a global datatyping mechanism does not excuse us from deciding   whether literals are tidy or untidy.  Does:       _:a foo:bar "lit" .     _:b bar:foo "lit" .    entail       _:a foo:bar _:l .     _:b bar:foo _:l .    Tempted as I am to duck this question, given our failure to agree, I don't   see a way to do so and retain a model theory.    At the June f2f we had a strawpoll on tidiness and the vote was narrowly in   favour of untidy.  Recognising that this was a change by a narrow margin   from one position to another, we decided to test this decision with the   community.  This we have done, and the responses that we got were 8 to 2 in   favour of untidiness.    In the meantime, we are considering a new datatyping option which requires   changes to the abstract syntax of RDF and to the concrete XML syntax, which   means that pretty much every other document is waiting on datatypes.    We need to see immediate and rapid progress on the datatypes document.  It   is putting all the rest of our efforts at risk.    Brian

I think the issue here is whether we need to retain the ability to say:       ex:Jenny ex:age _:x .     _:x rdfs:dlex "10" .    when we can say:       ex:Jenny ex:age _:x .     _:x xsdr:decimal "10" .    The former is useful if we want to be able to represent a graph where the   type of _:x is unknown, and then later add it, for all uses of ex:age by   adding the triple:       ex:age rdfs:range xsdr:decimal . # or drange if you prefer    A user case I have heard mentioned is where one scrapes some data from a   web page, captures it as:       ex:Jenny ex:age _:x .     _:x rdfs:dlex "10" .    Later discover that age's take a decimal value and add the range constraint.    It does seem to met that its unlikely to be too onerous to use replace the   rdfs:dlex xsdr:decimal in that situation.    Pat was pretty pasionate about this facility being needed;  I'm not groking   it.  Can anyone suggest what I'm missing?    Brian

That question seems separable, in fact I think we did separate it as timbl-02.    It seems a little odd to consider whether to keep bagid when we still have   the more general question of whether to keep reification at all, timbl-02.    Reviewing the discussion with Tim,  I think the conclusion of his last to me:    [[  Yes... the only logical thing is to remove it, and it would be easier  earlier than later, but would involve of course changing RDF M&S.  ]]       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0135.html    got to the point where Tim was suggesting that we remove reification all   together.  He has not responded to my question:    [[  Might you be persuaded that in these circumstances, the best course of  action is to leave it to a new, fresher WG to consider these issues and  that that WG would be best placed to decide how to move current use to  whatever solution they propose.

      Aaron,    This is excellent.  A great format for us to follow.    One thing about the test cases.  Could you confirm that that character  transaltion in test2 is correct.

        Hi Aaron,    I can't make it.  I'm going to schedule a telecon for Friday.  Do you   have input on the mimetype registration process.   Would you be happy to   request publication of the rfc?

        Pat,    to make sure you are informed, the WG decided on 28/Feb       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0053.html    [[  DECISION: An RDF graph is a set of triples, the term graph equality be  changed to graph equivalence and this disposes of danc-01 (contex:  http://www.w3.org/2003/02/28-rdfcore-irc#T16-37-35)  ]]    I think this is what you wanted.

      I received the following comment on the proposed resolution of rdfms-reification   -required from Wolfram:        Here is an example of RDF without bagID, where the reification is  required to (re-)construct the context of the "comment" property to be  able to answer, for example, a query that tries to retrieve the correct  comment for each different s:property that is attached to "Author".        <?xml version="1.0"?>    <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"  xmlns:s="http://description.org/schema/"  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#"     >      <rdfs:Resource rdf:ID="Author"/>    <rdf:Description about="#Author">  <s:name>Skolem</s:name>  <comment rdf:parseType="Literal">This is his last name</comment>  </rdf:Description>    <rdf:Description about="#Author">  <s:firstname>Toralf</s:firstname>  <comment rdf:parseType="Literal">This is his first  name</comment>  </rdf:Description>    </rdf:RDF>      [Note, however, that folks may consider this bad modelling practice and  say that this comment should actually be attached to a bagID. However, I  am pretty sure that there are cases where it is useful to be able to see  that a number of statements have been made "together in one description"  to be able to interpret, for example, lexically identic utterances that  are made in two or more descriptions in the appropriate context (ok, we  do not have the vocabulary yet to allow for such subtleties, and as  notions such as extensibility, scope and reification are not covered in  the current MT, we will not have it for some time, so now it may be  considered irrelevant)]    In the light of this comment, I've modified the proposed resolution:    Proposal:      The WG resolves that a parser is not required to always emit statements      representing a bag of reified statements for each Description      element.  A parser SHOULD emit statements describing a bag of reifed      statements when an rdf:bagID is present in the description element.      It SHOULD be possible to instruct a parser to emit bags of      reified statements for all description elements.    Brian

        In reviewing the Owl Reference last call WD at       http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-ref-20030331/    for RDFCore, I noticed the following comments that were not directly   related to RDFCore's interests.    Brian    -----------------------    3. Classes  [[  When in this document we use wording such as "a class of individuals ..",   this should be read as the "a class with a class extension containing   individuals ...".  ]]    typo: "should be read as the ...                          ^^^^^^^  -----------------------    [[  OWL Full allows the freedom of RDF Schema: a class may act as an instance   of another (meta)class (the same holds for properties).  ]]    The phrase "the same holds for properties" is unclear.  Does it mean       properties may act as an instance of class    or       properties may act as an instance of another (meta) property    I think the former is the only one that makes sense.  This confused me and   doesn't seem to add much so I suggest dropping the phrase in brackets.    ---------------------------    3.1    [[  The other five forms of class descriptions are represented as anonymous   instances of owl:Class (a blank node with the rdf:type owl:Class).  ]]    Two things wrong with this.  If my understanding is correct then the class   descriptions are represented by sets of triples, not by a single node.  The   single node represents the class, not its description.    Secondly, nodes don't have types; nodes can be the subject of a   triple.  Perhaps:    [[  The other five forms of class descriptions consist of a set of RDF triples   in which a blank node represents the class being described.  That blank   node has an rdf:type property whose value is owl:Class.  ]]    -----------------------------  [[  The class extension of owl:Thing is the set of all individuals in the   domain of discourse.  ]]    First use of the term "domain of discourse".  Is this part of the   vocabulary you expect your readers (users of the owl language) to have?    I suggest you just say its the set of all individuals, define the term or   import a definition of the term.    -----------------------------    [[  NOTE: owl:Nothing is not included in OWL Lite.  ]]    I'm not sure what that means.  Does this mean it is not predefined or does   it mean that any reference to it will render a document not in OWL   Lite?  If the latter:    [[  NOTE: An OWL Lite document may not refer to owl:Nothing.  ]]    -------------------------------    3.1.1    Is there a restriction that there may be only one enumeration for a class   description?    What happens with:    <owl:Class rdf:ID="c">     <owl:oneOf rdf:parseType="Collection">       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#a1"/>       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#a2"/>     </...  </...  <owl:Class rdf:about="#c">     <owl:oneOf rdf:parseType="Collection">       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#b1"/>       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#b2"/>       <owl:Thing rdf:about="#b3"/>     </...  </...    Suggest a little clarification.  ----------------------------    owlref-bwm-inconsistency    There is no discussion of inconsistency.  This is an omission from the   document that should be fixed.    ----------------------------    3.1.2.1    [[  To see why this is so, observe that the owl:allValuesFrom constraint   demands that all values of P belong to class P, and if no such values   exist, the constraint is trivially true.  ]]    Typo - I don't think you mean "belongs to class P".    -----------------------------------    3.1.2.2    [[  Note that an owl:minCardinality of one or more means that a value for the   property is required of any instance of the class.  ]]    I find the language confusing - whether to interpret 'any' as an   existential or a universal quantifier.  Clearer would be:    [[  Note that an owl:minCardinality of one or more means that all instances of   the class must have a value for the property.  ]]    -------------------------------------    3.1.3    [[  owl:complementOf is analogous to logical negation, but restricted to   individuals only.  ]]    The language here is not clear.  How do you logically negate an individual?    <aside>it occurs to me that is a question that often may occur to WG's   processing last call comments</aside>    The document might be trying to say that you can only take the compliment   of a class (or class description I'm not sure which) that contains only   individuals.  Or it might be saying that the compliment will only contain   individuals not in the complimented class, but will not contain things that   are not individuals.    I now think it means the latter, but on first read thought it meant the   former.  Needs clarifying, or possibly removing.    ---------------------------------------    [[  4. Properties    OWL distinguishes between two types of properties.  ]]    There are frequent references it he document to built-in properties.  Is   this a third type of property with specific characteristics?    ----------------------------------    4.1    [[  For a property one can define (multiple) rdfs:domain axiom.  ]]    typo:                                                ^^^^^^    ----------------------------------    4.3    [["functional" >For ...]]    Typo.    ----------------------------------    4.3 owlInverseFunctionalProperty    [[  If a property is declared to be inverse-functional, the a range value  ]]    Typo: "the a range"    ---------------------------------    [[  Symmetric properties should have identical domains and ranges to make sense.  ]]    Language?  Suggest:    [[The domain and range of a symmetric property are the same.]]    ----------------------------------    owl:AllDifferent    Please clarify the relationship between owl:AllDifferent and owl:oneOf,   i.e. does owl:oneOf imply that members of the list are distinct?      6.1 Datatypes    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype of which the   value is recommended to be one of the following:  ...    * The RDF datatype rdf:XMLLiteral.  ]]    The RDF datatype is not the value of the attribute, its the string           http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral    Suggest:    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype of which the   value is recommended to be one of the following:  ...    * The URIREF for the datatype rdf:XMLLiteral  ]]    ----------------------------------------    [[  * The primitive datatype  xsd:string, plus the following datatypes derived   from xsd:strong:  ]]    Typo: "derived from xsd:strong"    ---------------------------------------    7.1 Annotations    Should any of the following also be annotation properties, as they seem to   have no effect on the semantics:       o priorVersion     o backwardCompatibleWith     o incompatibileWith     o deprecatedClass     o deprecatedProperty    Suggest the description of what makes something an annotation property and   what the effect of being an annotation property should be clearer.  ------------------------------------------    owl:hasValue is described as taking either an individual or a data value as   its value.  There is a note OWL Lite does not support hasValue.    Given that OWL DL requires a separation between object properties and data   valued properties, please confirm that OWL DL supports owl:hasValue.  I   suggest that since this caused me to pause, that the note be extended to   specifically state that OWL DL does support it, perhaps because, as a built   in property, it is exempt from the restriction.    ------------------------------    In 3.1.2.2    [[  A restriction containing an owl:minCardinality constraint describes a class   of all individuals that have at least N distinct range values (individuals   or data values) for the property concerned, where N is the range value of   the cardinality constraint.  ]]    I presume that this means "semantically distinct" as mentioned elsewhere,   but since it is specifically called out elsewhere, the omission here   suggests that syntactic distinction is what is meant here.    -------------------------------    In 3.2    [[  For example, the following class axiom declares the URI reference Human to   be an OWL class:  ]]    Two things wrong with this.  'Human' isn't the URI reference, its   '#Human'.  But more importantly, '#Human' isn't an owl:Class; it names the   class.    -------------------------------    in 3.2.2    [[  This denotes indeed the same set of individuals as the previous axiom.  ]]    The term denotes is confusing here and its not clear what 'this' refers   to.  The text is liable to confuse the notion of class and its   extension.  Suggest:    [[  This axiom defines a class with exactly the same instances as the previous   axiom.  ]]    --------------------------------    4.1    [[  The rdfs:domain restrictions are global, meaning that they cannot be used   for an individual for which the class is not explicitly included in the   domain restriction.  ]]    Unparsable.  I have no idea what this means so can't suggest an alternative.    ------------------------------------    4.2 owl:inverseOf    [[  Syntactically, owl:inverseOf is a property that takes instances of   owl:ObjectProperty as domain and range values. An axiom of the form P1   owl:inverseOf P2 asserts that for every pair (x,y) in the property   extension of P1, there is a pair (y,x) in the class extension of P2, and   vice versa.  ]]    Typo: I think you mean:    [[  for every pair (x,y) in the property extension of P1, there is a pair (y,x)   in the *property* extension of P2,  ]]    ---------------------------------

We are not allowed  to change things just because we would have done it differently.    We have estblished (I claim) that the use of xml:lang in M&S is not  broken (there are several implemenations).  We have also established  that it is useful (Jan's use case).  That makes it a bit tricky to  justify changing it.

I think one of the motivations for suggesting this change was to deal  with the xml:lang issue in the way I suggested.  I was just pointing  out that there were problems with this.    Could you just remind me what the advantages of representing literals  in this way would be.    Brian

      Sandro Hawke has made a suggestion I thought I'd pass on to the WG.  His  message can be found at:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001AprJun/0138.html    and basically suggests that the RDF/XML grammar should be defined for  documents in canonical form.    Brian

If    <rdf:Description rdf:ID="foo"/>    is defined to be equivalent to, i.e. represents the same triples as:      <rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo"/>    and the round tripping test is defined to be that XML/RDF before  represents the same triples as the XML/RDF after (i.e. model  equivalence) which I think is the test that you suggest,  then this solution passes the round triping test.

        Thinking a little more about implementing this, I find that I need a   resolution mechanism to determine what script to run given the namespace   of the XML root element.

But the xsi mechanism may allow us to use DTD's and schemas to   override the interpretation of existing RDF.    Brian

Seems like this gets into (shuts eyes,  grimaces, holds breath) provenance and reification.  Does a PRISM  processor need to store the fact that a triple was generated  from description element with an rdf:about attribute rather than  an rdf:ID attribute.  Would generating isDefinedIn be enough  to capture the requisite information?  Does generating an  isDefinedIn contribute towards capturing the information?    Brian

The proposal was originally written before the WG was formed.  Hence  the langauge of MAY NOT, which recognised that as individuals we  didn't have the authority to change the spec, but pointing out that  if our proposal was accepted, the container specific productions  added nothing to the language.    In the context of the WG, I think we'd simply remove those productions  from the grammar ( and any references to them).    Brian

Relationship between xsd:string and plain literals       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-schema-ig/2003Jul/0043.html    and following    This basically says (if my reading is confirmed by Paul) that the  xsd:string value space is a subset of the set of finite sequences of  UNICODE characters, and that xsd define their own equivalence relation  for comparing pairs (type, value) for use in schema processing.    I don't understand why they need the latter and whether similar  arguments would apply to RDF.    7.qu-03    I coulnd't find a resolution for this, therefore  propose resolve qu-03  per:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0018.html    with the addition of stating that we have created a postponed issue for  consideration by a future WG.    8.

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.    On my list of possibles, I currently have:       - xmlsch-05 character sequences     - xmlsch-06 natural language data     - timbl-03 collection clutter    I'd like to have       danc-02 goofy literals     jang-01 datatype subclass entailment    and to make progress on both semantics and rdf vocabulary issues.    Without those, this telecon is looking rather bare.    Brian

        I was about to send out the datatypes message to rdf interest, but I'm   concerned that we have new information that means I need to change it.    Have we agreed that test A does not hold for untidy literals?  Patrick has,   and I think Jeremy has.  If so then I need to modify (simplify) the message   - tests B and C can be dropped.    The reasons we might decide that test A does not hold are:       o it requires a special case in the reification machinery     o it requires a special case in the container machinery     o it interacts badly with rdfs:subPropertyOf    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0004.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0009.html  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jul/0011.html    I need some feedback from the WG on this.    Brian        

        Trying to nudge the process along a bit - Pat - shout if this is barmy.    In this comment:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#horst-01    Herman makes a couple of points:       1) a specific example of incompleteness of the (then) closure rules     2) a general concern about the completeness of the closure rules,   suggesting that the claim be weaked to apply only to a specific class of   RDF graphs.

I'd like to make sure we have enough time for  our main business, so I'll put it under AOB and we'll take it if we have  time.  I'm currently of the view that proposal would lie outside our  current remit.    Brian

      Jan,    I've obsoleted test005 and added error002 as per:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Nov/0651.html    There may be some updating to do in the test cases WD.    Brian

        This is the usual call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  My list of   possibles includes:       o xml syntax for b-nodes     o approve DT's message     o review face to face decisions     o new RDF document outline     o procedure for determining reserved vocabulary     o review of soap encoding data model     o Effect of structured literals on the model theory    Brian

However, at least in my mind, my  prepared defense for objections to the removal of aboutEach has  been that it was a syntactic transform, and there is now a  blessed method for doing syntactic transforms on xml - xslt.    If we are going to say that this is an xslt problem, we should  do so being aware that we may be recommending the use of xslt  to meet certain needs.    Brian

I see a lot of merit in this approach.  I'm concerned that we get the   issues resolved and can move on.  Discussing resolutions to the issues in   terms of specific document changes works for me.  I've seen responses from   Peter and Danc to comment dispositions which I recall as "I want to see the   specific wording before I accept this".  Having the wording to point to is   helpful.    I would like to be able to point to the wording in the archive,   however.  Please could we mail a copy of the doc to the archive and refer   to it there, if you can't get it into the cvs.      >>You seem to have forgotten that we have stopped doing new work except in  >>response to issues raised.  >  >When we went to last call, I thought it was with a clear understanding   >that there remained a number of document presentation issues that needed   >to be fixed.

We are into judgement call territory here.    We clearly have scope to make editorial clarifications.  But I urge the   editors to use that scope sparingly.  Changes will be subject to further   review which takes time an energy from all of us.  In  general lets resist   the temptation to polish; a dull brass rec is worth more to me than a shiny   draft stuck in last call.

Personally, I'd rather they were not added.  MacGregor is happy is issue is   resolved without them, and I fear they may just draw further fire.  I think   its better not to mention them at all.      >As for the section title changes, I viewed these were editorial   >refinements that reflected the change of emphasis of the section contents.

That said, I don't want to do a second last   call, so I wouldn't want to have to done one as a result of polishing.    My suggestion for process here is that we make the necessary changes,   emphasis on *necessary* and then we'll look at the docs and decide whether   to ask for advancement or do a second last call.    >...  >  >I am becoming concerned that I may be out of step with the expectations of   >the working group here.

There may be some differences of view on the scale of editorial changes   that are desirable - I urge you to keep them minimal, but that doesn't rule   them out.  But I don't see anything else that does work in the context of   the way the wg are doing things.    I am pleased to see such a clear proposal for disposing of pfps-16.  I'm   hoping for a few more this week :)    I'll make comments on the specific text in another doc.    Brian

Aye, here seems to be the (a?) nub; the distinction between a fragment  of XML being part of a document and being embedded (is 'quoted' a better  term) in it.  It is well known that XML has trouble embedding XML inside  itself - entities being another case in point.    We need to be sure everyone understands what is being said here.  Feel  free to improve on the following.    Consider:    [[  This sentence, which refers to the French sentence "La plume de am tante  est rouge." is in English.  ]]    This sentence is true, even though it contains a French sentence,  because the French sentence is referred to in the sentence, but is not  part of it.    I don't think XML has such a mechanism for quoting bits of XML such as  in the above sentence, so that contextual attributes such as xml base  and xml lang don't apply inside them.  Patrick is arguing, I think, that  parseType="Literal" is such a mechanism introduced into RDF/XML.    [...]    >   > An RDF literal is precisely that, a *literal*.

Martin has argued that it should and spelled out his reasons which I  summarized in:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0072.html    It would be helpful if you could spell out the arguments for why a  parseType="Literal" fragment should not inherit xml:lang from its  context?

      Some of the action id's are duplicated.  I've straightened them out in my   action list; just put them in numerical order of occurrence.    Item 17: Issue rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces    As I recall, the proposal was approved.

All literals are required to balanced XML.  A graph that contained "<"   would not be a legal graph.

Yup - I must have explained it real well, or maybe its me who is confused.    Wherever you have "<" as a literal with the current design, we replace   it with "<".  One way to think of it is that "<" denotes "<".   Formally doing that introduces some complexities into the semantics, so   I was kinda hoping that could be avoided though.  Maybe we can't.  The   idea is that application should treat "<" as if it were "<".  >   >   >>The implementation does need to distinguish between markup and plain   >>text.

        I'd like to bring a little framing to this discussion in the hope that  we can wrap this up by this week's RDFCore telecon on Friday.    >From my perspective RDFCore has moved beyond the point where it is  seeking to consider improved designs.  The time for that was before last  call.  We are now checking for problems with the current design and its  specification.    I have allowed (could I have stopped it:) some discussion of the merits  of proposal that Martin has made.  This gave an opportunity for the WG  to recognise the merits of that design and say to the chairs - we messed  up - this design is much better - please give us the time to incorporate  it.  That has not happened.    So, discussion of the form "here is a better design" is out of order at  this stage.  Such suggestions need to be made at an earlier stage in the  process.    So we must now consider whether i18n are pointing to significant flaws  in the present design.    If I have understood correctly, there are broadly two issues:      a) a violation of an i18n design principle that there should be only  one way to represent text/markup with/without lang tags in RDF's  abstract syntax.      b) that users will be surprised that xml:lang tags that are in scope  around a parseType='Literal' do not affect that literal.    I note that in      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0187.html    Martin suggests that issue b) is "easily the most important one".    Martin:  To address issue a) as you would like will require significant  changes to the RDFCore specs which RDFCore is not persuaded would be  beneficial at this time.  We could spend more time and energy on it, but  it seems to me that, given your statement of importance we should focus  our efforts on resolving issue b).    Do you agree?    Brian        

        Pat,    Reviewing the semantics doc status, there are 5 NotAccepted.    pfps-02     http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-02    points to an error in the handling of strings.  What is the status of   this one?  Why can't we fix it?  What do I say to Tim to persuade him   that he should override the objection?    Brian

I have had another attempt at stating a rationale for the current design  based in what Patrick, Pat, Jeremy et al have written recently, and some  thoughts of my own.  I'm just trying to capture RDFCore thinking in one  place, so as usual, please correct, amend, clarify etc.    1. For RDF, its abstract syntax, i.e. the graph, is it primary  representation.  RDF/XML is a concrete syntax for representing graphs,  i.e. from an RDF perspective, the goal is to figure out how best to  represent graphs in RDF/XML, not how to represent RDF/XML in graphs.    The typical use case for XML Literals is where an XML literal will be  written into the middle of an XML document by an application.  This is  simplest if the xml literal is a standalone fragment that can be simply  written into the XML document.    2. RDFCore agrees with last call feedback that it received, that  building an XML specific mechanism into its core model is architecturaly  inappropriate - it mixes things that should be independent.  Accepting  this implies that parseType="Literal" values must use one of the  existing mechanisms - i.e. either plain literals or typed literals, or a  new more general mechanism must be invented, e.g. a new triple  structure.  An XML specific mechanism is undesirable.    3. For the common use case, where applications embed a literal in an XML  document, it is preferable to distinguish,in the graph, between plain  and XML literals, so that e.g. different escaping conventions can be  applied.    4. Taking the datatype approach creates the opportunity to subclass the  datatype XMLLiteral, so that the value of a property may be restricted  to a specific form of XML Literal, possibly specified using XML Schema.    5. The equality rules are different for plain and XML literals.      "<eg:prop eg:a='a' eg:b='b'/>" and "<eg:prop eg:b='b' eg:a='a'/>"    are different plain literals, but equal XML literals.    6. The notion that the literal in the RDF/XML fragment below     <eg:prop xml:lang="en" rdf:parseType="Literal">     <span xml:lang="fr">chat</span>   </eg:prop>    contains the English string "chat" as a substring seems bizarre.    2, 3, 4, 5  and 6 argue for using the datatyping mechanism to represent  xml literals.    7. The XSD datatyping model does not support the notion that the value  of a literal is affected by a language tag.  RDFCore's attempts to  introduce this notion caused considerable complexity and difficulty in  the model theory and met with strong negative feedback.    Thus, if language is to affect the value of an xml literal it must be  part of the members of the lexical space of the datatype.      This can be accomplished by the parser generating a wrapper element to  hold the lang tag.    8. The generation of a wrapper element is undesirable for the following  reasons:     - it is unhelpful in a primary use case where one wants to simply embed  the literal in another XML document - the application has to get rid of  the wrapper element, and find another enclosing element on which to hang  the lang tag.     - implementation complexity in general, caused by introducing and  removing the wrapper element     - the value of a property cannot be an arbritary XML fragment - it must  always have an outer wrapper     - the user may be surprised that the XML fragment is not identical to  the one represented in the RDF/XML, e.g. XPATH expressions won't work as  expected.    Thus we are left with the current RDFCore proposal.    The practical experience of WG members suggests that thinking of  parseType="Literal" values as isolated fragments of XML that do not  inherit language from their context, i.e. the current RDFCore design, is  appropriate in practice.    It has also been suggested that it is easier to integrate data from  different sources when xml lang is not inherited from context.  I am  finding that one hard to follow, unless the integration is being done  cut and paste by hand, since it is easy to always put an xml:lang=""  next to every rdf:parseType="Literal" to ensure language isolation.   Perhaps someone can provide an example to show the advantage.    Martin:     - leaving aside whether you agree with the value judgements it makes,  would you accept that the above represents close to a coherent rationale  for the current RDFCore proposal?     - do you find it at all persuasive?    Brian        

        Semantics issue       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#qu-03    was summarized by Pat in    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0318.html    as    [[  There is a class of languages called 'ontology languages'.  Considered as an ontology language, RDFS provides too much expressive  power, and the extra power is inappropriate for an ontology language.  Therefore, it would be desirable if a subset of RDFS could be  identified which conforms to the requirements for an ontology  language (by imposing constraints on the ability to define classes of  classes, classes of properties and properties of classes, as outlined  later in your message.)  ]]    This co-chair states that the RDFCore WG was chartered to complete the   work on RDF Schema.  The definition of subsets of RDF Schema for   particular purposes is out of scope for this WG.    Propose the WG resolve:    o This comment is not accepted on the grounds it is out of scope and the   WG does not have the resources to take on this additional task.    Brian

        This topic is beginning to generate long emails which may be redundant if   the cause is a minor confusion.  If so maybe we can save a little effort.    At 10:52 25/02/2003 -0600, pat hayes wrote:    >>I think I agree with Patrick on this one.  >>  >>The last call WDs show a URI denoting a datatype but not part of the  >>datatype denoted.  >  >Lets forget about 'part of'.    I think that's the term that caused the problem, and that Pat just withdrew it.    The cause of the problem is that folks (including me) are worried that Pat   is proposing a change to what a datatype is, and since we are using the XML   Schema datatype model, that could be a problem.    Having read the latest MT doc:       http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/RDF_Semantics_Editors.html#dtype_interp    I don't think that is what is happening, but I'm not sure.  I think the new   semantics doc hasn't changed what a datatypes is, but has introduced the   URIREF of the datatype into the *formal machinery* describing the semantics   of the datatype, which is probably ok.    Lets try a test case.  From       http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#datatype    [[  [Definition:]  In this specification, a datatype is a 3-tuple, consisting   of a) a set of distinct values, called its ?value space?, b) a set of   lexical representations, called its ?lexical space?, and c) a set of   ?facet?s that characterize properties of the ?value space?, individual   values or lexical items.  ]]    So xsd:decimal denotes a 3-tuple, and the URIREF of the datatype is not a   component of the 3-tuple, nor is it 'part-of' any component of the 3-tuple.    Pat, does the semantics document say anything that conflicts with this   statement?    Brian        

        Sorry for this folks, but I'm checking whether our mail systems are   being creative and deciding which of my emails are worth passing on.    Brian

        I messed up the design of the software that does last call comment  tracking.  It requires a separate response for each issue, otherwise we  get responses that are of type "accepted" and "notaccepted"  simultaneously.    When responding to issues please generate a separate response for each  issue.    Jeremy, I'll send refs into comments for each issue pointing to your  bulk xml schema response to keep my software straight.    Brian

        Hi Martin,    Whilst this is a continuation of a previous conversation, as I'm  including the archive, I've dropped the context and am starting afresh.    I understand that I18N have concerns about the current RDFCore design  for literals.  I have recently sent an argument [1] to I18N that I hope  will persuade you to support the current design.    Whilst I am happy to discuss this issue with you personally at any time,  I would appreciate the opportunity to hear feedback from the rest of  I18N directly, and to address any questions they might have.    I understand you may be considering raising a formal objection.  I think  it would be best to meet with I18N before that decision is taken, and  further, I think it would help my understanding to observe the process  of taking that decision.    Brian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jul/0238.html        

      Folks,    I'm sorry, but I'm going to be late getting the agenda out for the telecon  on Friday.  I'll do my best get it done by end of work UK time today.  In  the meantime, if there are any suggestions for agenda items, please send  them in as soon as you can.    Brian

        Guys,    Is there a good reason to cross post here? We've got a disciplined process   (I hope) for handling traffic on rdf-comments.  We have a different process   for rdfcore.  If you post to both, its not clear what rules apply.    These look like last call comments to me and should be on rdf-comments.

      This is the usual call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  I need   them please, by noon, uk time on Thursday.    My current list of possibles includes:       - current status update     - preparing for the f2f     - reification - possible closure     - data typing status     - issue resolutions - see my recent post     - syntax issue resolutions    Looks like a busy agenda.

Yes, I think you are right that it does not state explicitly that they  are disjoint.  In reading the spec I ascribe some information to the  fact that m&s calls out that an object can be either a resource or a  literal and says only that subject is a member of resources.  Whilst this  may not be a mathematically precise statement that resources and  literals are disjoint, it seems pretty clear that it was the intent  that they are and that subjects may not therefore be literals.    I would agree with you that this could be made more clear.  But I'm  not sure this is what you are suggesting.      >   > > Which is maybe not how some folks would like it to be.

        I've updated the issue tracking doc to include objections and responses.    There is a summary of the objections at [1].  Each objection links to   the relevant issue (except completeness of entailment rules which may be     about to go away) and its late.    The relevant issue contains the WG response to the objection.    I've taken into account feedback from DanC, which includes stating the   conflicting requirements on the datatypes objection and some (much   shorter) text on the I18N issue.    Please review.    The intent is that the request to advance will refer to the objections   in the issue doc.    Brian

        Reviewing the mailing list archive, the discussion of the semantics of   rdf:value seems have originated in:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Nov/0648.html    [[General comment, not specifically Primer:  the description of rdf:value is  fine, but how does it relate to a normative specification?  What can we say  formally about rdf:value?   What formal semantics (interpretation) allows  us to make inferences like: ...]    Reviewing the issues list, I find:       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-replace-value    [[  Resolution: This issue was discussed by the RDFCore WG on 11 January 2002   which resolved:    o resolves to not change the name of this property at this time on the grounds:    - insufficient reasons to make this change    - will cause existing uses to be illegal - such as examples in m&s    o resolves to recast this issue as a need to clarify the semantics of   rdf:value.    At the February 2002 face to face meeting, the RDFCore WG resolved:         * that rdf:value is a property defined in the RDF namespace       * that the model theory state that rdf:value is a property       * that no other model theory semantics is defined specifically for it       * the issue be closed.  ]]    In the absence of new information this issue will not be reopened.

Well you say [[Datatyping in RDF is the use of a datatype to associate a   lexical form with a denoted value.]]  That is a means to achieve the end I   suggested [[Datatypes are used in RDF to represent values such as integers,   floating point numbers and dates.]]  Then goal is to express values.      >Section 2.4.5:  I think this section makes an important point.

        The RDFCore WG have asked me to send this comment on their behalf, as an   addition to others already sent.    Brian    -------------------------------    owlref-rdfcore-relationship-to-RDF    RDFCore are concerned about the clarity in the OWL specifications of what  RDF is legal OWL DL and OWL lite.  This seems to be described only in S+AS  which is a highly technical document and is likely to be inaccessible to  many.  On reviewing the reference document some significant restrictions  were not apparent to the RDFCore reviewer.  We cannot be confident,  therefore, that other restrictions we would care about, have not been missed.    RDFCore requests that the specifications be amended to include a  description of necessary conditions for a RDF document to be in OWL DL and  OWL Lite.  This description should be as accurate as possible consistent  with a goal of it being comprehensible to a majority of the community.    Such a description may bring to light further issues.    -------------------------------         

      We need to resolve the question of whether this issue is in scope or not.    Lets review the criteria for what is in and out of scope for the WG.    The charter says:        Implementor feedback concerning the RDF Model and Syntax Recommendation     points to the need for a number of fixes, clarifications and improvements     to the specification of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax.      ...      The role of the RDF Core WG is to prepare the way for such work by     stabilizing the core RDF specifications. The RDF Core WG is neither     chartered to develop a new RDF syntax, nor to reformulate the RDF model.    I presume that we are all still comfortable to be bound by the charter.  Broadly, the charter says we are to fix, clarify and improve the  SPECIFICATION of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax.  We are  specifically forbidden from reformulating the RDF model.    What does m&s say about the relationship between resources and literals.  The problem we have is that m&s is not as clear on some things as it  could be - that's why the WG exists after all.  Whilst its possible to  come up with creative interpretations of the document, we should  in principal not indulge ourselves like that.  Where multiple  interpretations are possible, the simplest and most obvious is to  be preferred.      I suggest that the issue in question here is whether the abstract model  described in m&s has a distinguished representation for Literals.    I have phrased this question carefully.  The question is not whether a   literal is a resource, for to answer that we need to resolve a bunch  of difficult issues around what resources are.  The question is  whether the abstract model described in m&s treats literals specially.  If it does, then so must we if we are to avoid 'reformulating' the model.    Brian

      Dave,    Thanks for this.  A couple of nits:    In test 2, should the rdf:bagID attribute not be an ID rather a full URI.    Did you have a particular reason for not including illegal examples?  Is it  not essential to include some?    Finally, and I hate to burden you further, but would it be possible to  make the text of the test cases visible in the message.  Right now, accessing  the mail archive I have to do a view page source to get to see the test cases.    Brian        

        I've had an offlist email telling me the tone of this message was a bit,   shall we say, crusty.    That comment is right, and my apologies.  I should have taken more time to   explain.   From my point of view its a minor nit, but W3C, rightly, take it a bit   more seriously.    We need to get the directors approval for publication of a first working   draft.  Until we've done that, the document can't be accurately called a   W3C WD.  There has been some discussion of this lately on the chairs list   and Janet Daly recently asked for the Datatypes doc to be amended to be   clear that it is not (yet) a WD.  I didn't want us to commit the same   offence twice in rapid succession, hence the unfortunately terse request   for a rapid fix.    Once again my appologies to Graham.

      Jonathan,    I'd prefer, for the moment that folks do not cross post to both rdfcore and   webont lists.  Jeremy was careful not to do so and I request that you also   refrain from doing so.    My reason for this is to try to bound the volume of email and keep some   structure to the discussion.  RDFCore is considering going to last call in   early May, so I'd like to us to apply some self discipline and good process   and keep focused on what we have to do to accomplish that.  I ask for your   support.    As for the layering issue, I am committed to getting the WG's to work   together to resolve it.  Folks from both WG's have already been working on   this, and I have today, through the coordination group, asked for an update.    Once we have an assessment of the situation, we can decide how best to   proceed.  In the meantime however, RDFCore is having some exploratory   discussions.    I am concious that significant and hurried late changes to a spec are   unlikely to improve its quality.  So I personally will be looking for ways   in which RDFCore and WEBONT, working together, can take the time they need   to work out what changes to RDF(S) are necessary to best integrate RDF and   OWL.    In saying that, I have in mind that it should be possible to push the work   done so far through the standards process and also that RDFCore can work   with WEBONT over a longer period to address the layering and other issues   that our current charter required us to postpone.    Please feel free to post a pointer to the archive version of this message   to webont if you think it would be of interest to that community.  I, of   course, have refrained from cross posting.

Hi Patrick,    My first reaction is Tim has dipped into this conversation not having the   full context and we need to figure whether there is a simple   misunderstanding here or a substantive issue.  We had a definite answer to   your question from DanC at the last telecon.  If Tim disagrees, then we   ought to explore that, but he might have been misunderstood.    So, I suggest, before we get all excited, we figure out if there is an   issue and exactly what it is.    Last week on email and in the telecon you asked DanC a straight question   about N3.  You got a firm and definitive answer.  You now think that Tim's   post suggests he has a different view.  Fair enough.  Why not ask Tim your   question.    Brian        

        -----Forwarded Message-----    From: Dave Reynolds <der@hplb.hpl.hp.com>  Subject: Jena semantic tests  Date: 25 Jul 2003 17:05:37 +0100      Following on from Jeremy's posting concerning ARP and the current set of working  group tests.    On the approved entailment tests 20030725, Jena passes 37, declines to implement  5 and fails 1 due to the recent changes in WG decision. The latter will be  fixed.    Details below.    Dave    Summary:  Of the 43 tests:    37 pass OK    1  fail (xml:lang on Literals) and will fix    2  fail and might fix    3  fail and do not intend to fix    Of the passes there is one test that needed correction to the downloaded files.    ** Invalid test:  rdfs-subClassOf-a-Property/Manifest.rdf#test001 is defined in the manifest but  the data file is not included in the approved_20030725.zip file. However,  downloading the files separately from the respository then this one passes.    ** Failures - will not fix:  PositiveEntailmentTest rdfms-seq-representation/Manifest.rdf#test004 - FAIL  PositiveEntailmentTest rdfms-seq-representation/Manifest.rdf#test002 - FAIL    These two tests assert that the empty document entails various properties     of _1. By my reading of the specs this is not correct, only mentioned     container membership properties should result in such entailments and    there are no such mentions in the empty document.    If I'm wrong and these tests are correct then we will not implement     them anyway, this is too alien to users to be acceptable.    PositiveEntailmentTest xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-3 - FAIL    This tests bNode introduction - that a typed literal entails a graph     with a bNode of type rdf:Literal. We have deliberately omitted the     bNode introduction rules from the reasoner config on the grounds that     this is not the way an RDF API should do it - users can query the     nodes themselves for type information and creating virtual triples     for this would be wrong from an API perspective.    ** Failures - could fix:  NegativeEntailmentTest xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-2 - FAIL  NegativeEntailmentTest xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-1 - FAIL    These test non-mutual entailment of a valid literal with an invalid     literal that differs only by whitespace. Unfortunately our XSD     handling library is happy with the whitespace and doesn't     treat " 3 " as an invalid int.     This could be fixed if that is indeed how XSD is supposed to work,    though the current behaviour seems more useful in practice.    ** Failure - will fix:  PositiveEntailmentTest datatypes/Manifest.rdf#language-and-xml-literal - FAIL    This is the xml:lang on xml:Literals issue. To be fixed.    ** Pass:  rdfms-seq-representation/Manifest.rdf#test003 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#language-ignored-for-numeric-types-3 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#range-clash - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#test010 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#test008 - OK  tex-01/Manifest.rdf#language-tag-case-1 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#language-ignored-for-numeric-types-2 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#semantic-equivalence-within-type-1 - OK  tex-01/Manifest.rdf#language-tag-case-2 - OK  rdfs-subPropertyOf-semantics/Manifest.rdf#test001 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#non-well-formed-literal-1 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#language-ignored-for-numeric-types-1 - OK  rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf/Manifest.rdf#test001 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#semantic-equivalence-within-type-2 - OK  rdfs-no-cycles-in-subPropertyOf/Manifest.rdf#test001 - OK  rdf-charmod-uris/Manifest.rdf#test003 - OK    rdfs-subClassOf-a-Property/Manifest.rdf#test001 - OK  rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.rdf#intensionality-domain - OK  statement-entailment/Manifest.rdf#test003 - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#non-well-formed-literal-2 - OK  rdfms-xmllang/Manifest.rdf#test007a - OK  statement-entailment/Manifest.rdf#test004 - OK  horst-01/Manifest.rdf#subClassOf-intensional - OK  rdfs-container-membership-superProperty/Manifest.rdf#test001 - OK  rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.rdf#intensionality-range - OK  datatypes/Manifest.rdf#test009 - OK  statement-entailment/Manifest.rdf#test001 - OK  rdf-charmod-uris/Manifest.rdf#test004 - OK  rdfms-xmllang/Manifest.rdf#test007b - OK  horst-01/Manifest.rdf#subPropertyOf-intensional - OK  xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-4 - OK  rdfms-xmllang/Manifest.rdf#test007c - OK  statement-entailment/Manifest.rdf#test002 - OK    Dave

      Pat,    - sans chapeau    I'd like to suggest that ALT does need special treatment in the model theory.    At the beginning of M&S 3.1 it says:      Alternative   A list of resources or literals that represent alternatives                  for the (single) value of a property. Alternative might be                  used to provide alternative language translations for the                  title of a work, or to provide a list of Internet mirror                  sites at which a resource might be found. An application                  using a property whose value is an Alternative collection                  is aware that it can choose any one of the items in the list                  as appropriate    If a resource has two titles, one in French and the other in English, then  both are the titles of the work, i.e. conjunctive.  An application however,  may choose to display only one.    If software can be downloaded from several mirror sites, then that software  can be downloaded from all them, not just one of them, i.e. again conjunctive.  The idea that this example meant to express the idea that one of these sites  has the software, you can go try them to figure out which one seems a little  far fetched.    I suggest DanC is right here; the use of ALT is a hint to an application  about how it might process this information.    I suggest where M&S uses the word 'or' in this context we must be careful to  determine whether it is discussing how an application might process the  information in the model, or what the assertions actually mean.    > Could what the application level convention 'does' with this  > construction have any conclusions that would have any logical  > inferences?    I can't think of any within the context of our current thinking.    To account for it we have to introduce the idea of an application.  Lets say that a program P runs on an RDF graph G.  Lets  assume that part of P involves running subprogram P' on the value of some  property of some resource, lets call it C for container.    The semantics then of bag, alt and seq can be described as:      if C is a Seq, execute P' on the members of C in order.    if C is a Bag, execute P' on the members of C in any order    if C is a Alt, execute P' on one of the members of C    Now this doesn't feel very satisfactory at all.  I don't believe  this for all possible P'.  For instance a validity checker would  check that all the members of an Alt were still valid.    Ah, maybe:  A Sequence seq implies the existence of an ordering  relation order(seq) on its members.  A Bag implies no such thing.  An Alt alt implies the existence of a function default(alt).

        At 14:06 22/04/2003 +0300, Jeremy Carroll wrote:    >Summary: reject.    Summary: I'm wondering if the response misses the point of the comment.    The comment says "surely a reason ought to be given" why we don't describe   the type of a literal as we did the type of other resources, i.e. with a   property arc whose subject is the literal to the type.    I suggest:    The WG interprets this comment as two questions and a comment:       1)  Why is the type of a literal not described using a property arc, as   is done for other literals?       2)  Having introduced typed literal nodes, why not introduce typed   resource nodes and typed property arcs as well       3)  The WG should provide a rationale for this design in the specifications    Regarding question 1:    This would require that literals be allowed as subjects of RDF   statements.  This is not possible in current RDF/XML and would require   considerable change, beyond the scope of the WG, to  support it.    Further   it introduces problems of non-monotonicity in the semantics.  A property   whose value is plain literal is currently taken to denote a sequence   characters.  Adding a further statement could change that value to, say an   integer, invalidating previous inferences and breaking a fundamental tenet   of RDF.    Regarding question 2:    No requirement justified a change to the notion of a URIREF node or an RDF arc.    Regarding comment 3:    Providing a rationale document to accompany the specifications would   certainly be nice to have, but given we don't have the resources to do one,   must remain so.  We reject this comment on the grounds that the   specifications are not intended to provide a rationale.      >The comment is  >[[  >    The introduction of pairs consisting of a lexical form and a type (or,  >     strictly speaking, a lexical form and a type label) seems at first  >     glance to complicate the RDF model somewhat.

      Morning chaps,    M&S already contains a glossary:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#274    I suggest that places it firmly in scope.

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items which I need by noon uk time   Thursday, please.    On my list of possibles I currently have:      o approving concepts and abstract model for publication    o reviewing against schedule    o datatypes    I  may well not be properly back up to speed, so please let me know if I   missed anything obvious.

      I got confused when I looked at this in navigator (v 4.72) which predates  HTML 4.  Deletions in 3.1 don't show up as deleted and the result is wrong.    Are there any guidelines as to which versions of HTML tech reports can rely  on?  I'd suggest at least we need some statement in the doc warning folks,  e.g.      <del>This text should be deleted.  If it is not, your browser will         not display this section properly.</del>    Brian    Dave Beckett wrote:  >   > >>>Dan Connolly said:  > > It's fine to use stylesheets to make a nice style,  > > but please check that essential distinctions are  > > visible without the stylesheet.  >   > >  2.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available  > >  without color, for example from context or markup.  >   > I use <ins> and <del> for the changes, taken from HTML 4.

      We have our first face to face meeting coming up in just a few weeks.  Personally, I am looking forward to the chance to meet everyone and  exchange a few beers.  (I have a  penchant for Sierra Nevada and   Anchor Steam.)    Face to face time is rare and extremely valuable.  We should take care to  make the most of this opportunity.  So as well as making sure we have some  fun, I would like to suggest that we set ourselves some goals for things  we'd like to accomplish by the end of the face to face.    To initiate the discussion of what those goals might be, I'd like to  suggesting the following:    That by the end of the face to face we have:      o agreed an abstract syntax with at least the expressive power of      n-triple and defined its semantics      o resolved all outstanding issues with RDF schema      o decided how we will define RDF/XML (BNF, XML Schema?, DTD?, other)      and its transformation (XSLT, other?) to n-triple    and within two weeks of the end of the face to face we have documented the  first two of these decisions in WG drafts.    Brian

Yes, sorry if you didn't find everything from there.  I couldn't find  the link I was really looking for at the time.    A good place to start is the minutes of the meeting where the decision  was taken:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0138.html    You want agenda item 12.    >   > The overall conclusion is that none of them requests to remove  > language information from XML literals, neither directly, or,  > as far as I could infer, indirectly.

Pat?    I still can't find the email I'm looking for.

        This is a use case concerning xml literals which we identified during   our discussions this week, and a little analysis of it.  The use case   may need some refining to fully capture i18n concerns.    Consider an application which is building an RDF store of metadata about     web pages.  It crawls the web extracting title information from web   pages and storing then represents this data as RDF.    Lets say it is searching for <title> elements, which may contain   arbritary markup.  Trying for example:       <title><em>title</em></title>    Hmm, checking Amaya behaves oddly in this situation, and Mozilla gets it   wrong.  And the validator objects - says you ain't allowed <em> in   titles.  This is XHTML 1.1.  Lets try span.  No, that doesn't seem to be   legal either.    <title><span xml:lang="en">title</span></title>    Doesn't validate.  Checking, the content model for the title element is   PCDATA. Ok, lets suppose its:    [[  <head xml:lang="en">     <title>chat</title>  </head>  ]]    That validates.  But I note that XHTML 1.1 does not allow markup in titles!    How does the application represent this in RDF?    Since you can't use markup in a title element, use a plain literal :)    But lets assume we are far sighted and assume that markup will be   allowed in titles in the future.    Well, in that case, you could use an rdf:XMLLiteral and include a span   element to hold the lang tag.    Objection: But then you couldn't use that literal with XHTML 1.1.    Response: Record that information separately in the graph e.g.       <rdf:Description rdf:about="...">       <ex:title>         <rdf:Description>           <rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">chat</rdf:value>           <ex:lang>en</ex:lang>         </rdf:Description>       </...      Objection:  You've changed the title.  You can't recover the exact   markup that was there in the first place because you can't tell whether   the span was added by the crawler or was there in the first place.    Response: Most of the time, you won't care.  If you do care, you can   record the extra information in the graph.    Objection: <span> is html specific.  you might want to use the literal   in another context.    Response: Really need to refine the use case here, but in general if you   are not prepared to commit to a specific markup language, you can use   the graph to represent the underlying structure.

I've removed my "value add" and made a change to respond to Patrick's point.      (e) in order to break a URI into a namespacename and a local  name, split it at after last XML non-name character.

      Hi Jan,    I understand the problem.  If we can get a permanent directory structure for  test cases then the problem will go away.    How about for the moment we assume that all test cases have uri's of the  following form:      http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/[issue-id]/testnnn.rdf    and results are      http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/[issue-id]/testnnn.nt    where [issue-id] is e.g. rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr    Brian          Jan Grant wrote:  >   > OK, one more try.

      Hi Pat,    Literals formed the main technical discussion at the telecon last Friday.  My   understaning, (haven't checked the minutes yet) is that we agreed that there is   an important choice to be made between on the one hand your choice 2, where the   type is 'part of' the literal, and other choices where the type information is   represented in the structure of triples.    I'll probably get this wrong from logical point of view, but I've got another   terminological problem.  I wonder if it would help to talk about representing   instances of concrete data types, such as int, date, float etc, thus   distinguishing between what RDF currently calls literals and these other beasties.

        I am in the middle of reviewing the concepts document.  It seems to have at   least two conventions for indicating a new term that is being   introduced/defined.  Does W3C give any guidelines for this?  It would be   better if all the docs did it the same way.    belatedly  Brian

Have I missed   the point, or is this not the very issue that is being "discussed".    Perhaps being clear what the issue is and discussion of pro's and cons   might be more productive than dogmatic assertion of individual viewpoints.    I think the question might be:       Should the abstract syntax of a datatyped literal have an xml:lang   component?    So far, I have seen:       1) If its not then one can't usefully say:          <rdfs:label rdf:lang="en" rdf:datatype="...string">foo</...        <rdfs:label rdf:lang="fr" rdf:datatype="...string">bar</...       2) the xml:lang component has no effect on the mapping from the lexical   form to the value.    On this last point, do we expect that always to be the case?  What would we   do if a new version of schema datatypes did take xml:lang into account?  Do   we know they are unlikely to do this?    Brian        

      DanC makes concrete a fundamental philosophical point:      An RDF processor can never know enough about the real world to decide    that two anonymous descriptions were intended to describe the same    resource.    Thus, if an RDF processor is ever to generate a URI for an anonymous  resource, it must never use the same URI twice, otherwise it risks  asserting that two different resources are in fact the same.    The only algorithms that it can use therefore are those that generate  (probably) unique identifiers each time they are called such as uuidgen.

      An updated summary of the datatyping issues, as I currently understand them.    Changes:       B4 non-entailment confirmed but significance disputed     'extended n-triples' dropped     B9 - simple self entailment example added    Issue B1:  =========    In S, if one wants to use both idiom A and idiom B, e.g.    <mary> <age> "10" .  <age> <rdfs:range> <xsd:integer.lex> .    and    <mary> <ageD> _:a .  _:a <xsd:integer.map> "10" .    two properties have to be used, <age> and <ageD>, in this example.    I believe there is a agreement that this is a difference between the  two proposals. Indeed, it may be said that the main aim of TDL is  to avoid requiring different properties for these different idioms.    Can't Live With: PatrickS      Issue B2: Multiple Lexical Representations of a data value  ==========================================================  S, idiom A, permits multiple lexical representations of a data value:    _:i <xsd:double> "10.1" .  _:i <xsd:double.de> "10,1" .    I believe there is agreement that S-A allows this.    No-one has said this is a can't live with, so I'm proposing to drop this.   Going, going, ...    Issue B3: the self entailment issue  ===================================  Withdrawn in favour of B4:    From:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0410.html    [[I accept the reasoning above; it doesn't address my objection;  it' just shows that my example wasn't very good. Sergey's  example makes the point better:]]    B9 also added in response to Graham's request.      Issue B4 - TDL breaks existing code  ===================================  This is similar to B3. I've changed the example slightly from Sergey's.    Under TDL, consider the graph:    _:f <rdf:type> <film> .  _:f <dc:Title> (_, "10") .  <mary> <age> (_, "10").    Does this entail:    _:x <dc:Title> _:y .  _:z <age> _:y .    I believe there is agreement that it does not under the current TDL model   theory, or the new one proposed by Jeremy on 31/01/2002.    The significance of this is disputed.    Can't Live With: DanC      Issue B5: Storage Requirements  ===============================  TDL requires significantly more storage to implement.    This is disputed.      Issue B6: S requires 4 URI's be registered for each data type  =============================================================  S requires that for each datatype 4 URI's be registered  datatype  datatype.lex  datatype.val  datatype.map    Sergey: Do you agree this is the case? If not, how many URI's are required   to implement ALL the idioms of S and coexist in the same model.      Issue B7: Complexity  ====================  S has too many ways of expressing the same thing. An RDF processor has to   be aware of them all. Supported by Jeremy's error cases message       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0397.html    and a message from Andy Seaborne to rdf comments:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002JanMar/0058.html      Issue B8: S-B encourages logically (sic) errors in the  application type processing.  =======================================================  Given:    _:f <rdf:type> <film> .  _:f <dc:Title> "10" .  <mary> <age> "10" .    an application 'knows' that the range of <age> is an integer so it 'knows'   that mary has <age> 10. Under S-B, running a query:    ?x <dc:Title> ?y .  ?z <age> ?y .    will return ?x = _:f and ?z = <mary>, and knowing that the age of <mary> is   10, may conclude that the title of the film is also 10.    Can't Live With: Jeremy      Issue B9: In TDL a document does not entail itself  ==================================================    Under TDL, does:       <foo> <dc:Title> "W3C" .    entail       <foo> <dc:Title> "W3C" .    This was recognized as a bug in the TDL model theory.    Can't Live with:  DanC, JJC, GK    Jeremy has proposed a model theory fix:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0464.html    GK, DanC, PatH: do you accept the fix and a document does entail itself   under TDL?

      Hi Pat,    >   > I will put off further work on the MT document until this issue is decided.    That get's the blood flowing first thing in the morning.    We can make this decision independently from deciding whether prince arcs are  allowed.    Whether or not we decide to allow prince arcs, we should adopt a notation  that would allow them to be representated.  That way any future WG, (and ours)  is free to decide that they are allowed, without having to revamp the  core representation.    We decided at the F2F to use a graph notation.  If we can *reasonably* extend  that notation to support prince arc's I suggest we stick with the decision  we made.      To extend the graph notation we'd need:      o non-URI identifying labels on arcs    o a node and an arc can have the same label    o a scoping notation    Is that sufficient?  If it is, is it a reasonable notation on which to base  the formal semantics?    Brian    ps: If I may say so, Pat, that was a very good catch.

We could first try:      - point out the introduction which states that normative statements  are explicitly labelled as such      - point out that section 2 is not labelled as normative and section 4  is.      - ask him if that clears up the confusion.  If it does fine, if it  doesn't at least we are down to the wording of section 4.    I can take this if you prefer.

This call is late, (I've been buried in meetings all week) but   if you've got suggestions for items, please let me know.    If you've got proposals for issues we should discuss, those would be most   welcome, as I didn't do too well last week at picking those we could   usefully progress.    Brian

        Sorry this is late.  I've been buried in other stuff and my network at home   went down last night.  I'm catching up this morning.    Suggestions for agenda items for this weeks telecon welcome.  Please let me   know what, if any, key issues you feel we need to discuss.    Brian

Thats right, though I'd modify the emphasis.  Test cases were used to   express/represent/communicate issues and decisions.  Test cases were   used to explain/communicate clearly what the issue was, and what the   resolution was.  In some cases this worked wonderfully well.  For   example, the semantics example you quote had caused no end of confusion   before it was expressed as a test case.    It was really the issue we were deciding, not the test case per se.  The   representation of the issue and the decision was one or more test cases.     The test cases were a means to an end, not an end in themselves.  We   were not setting out to produce a conformance test suite, though as a   side effect of the process, we got a useful, though incomplete, set of   test cases for software.    >   > The editors then had complete freedom to write text which conformed with the   > test cases. (The text was later reviewed, so the freedom was not as excessive   > as it seems).     Well, as you point out, 'complete freedom' is overstating it.  The WG   relied on the skill of the editors to draft words for the specs that   expressed the WG's decision.  Generally, this draft text was reviewed by   the WG.  Usually the test cases were retained in the test suite to   augment the specifications.    I think this worked well for us.

With no disrespect to Sandro, (we are deeply indebted to him for   automating the analysis of test results) he was not a member of RDFCore.     If input on how RDFCore actually used test cases in spec development   is sought, if may well be useful also to have someone present who   participated more broadly in the process.    Brian

      Folks,    You will see I suggest a new name for Jeremy's entailment [1].  And before   Jeremy gets in, I did consider calling it the Cannot entailment.  Beware   more puns ahead.    Several months after the Cannes f2f we have not agreed on a solution to   this issue that the working group has agreed is a problem.  We have by   default been steering a course which would result in publishing a Datatypes   WD with this problem unresolved, seeking feedback from the community as to   whether they see this as a real obstacle.    In the light of recent discussions on datatyping, I think we need to   consider this explicitly.    I'm aware of the following options (details below) for dealing with this   problem:       o ask the community if its really a problem and they say no.     o the know fix (ho ho)     o the rule fix     o the syntax fix     o the abandon hope fix    Given the difficulties we have in agreeing anything about datatypes, and   the large amount of work we have done and not yet shared with the   community, I suggest we ask the community by publishing a WD, explicitly   seeking feedback on this issue and possibly listing the various options we   have identified.    The know fix  ============    In the know fix, we assume that the knowledge that       <jenny> <age> "10" .    really means       <jenny> <age> _:a .     _:a <xsd:decimal> "10" .    is defined elsewhere.  Perhaps an application just 'knows' that this is the   case.  Perhaps there are some rules defined outside of RDF for expressing   this.  However, its done, we take the view that if you want to do this sort   of thing, you do it extra-rdf.      The Rule Fix  ============    We build a rule mechanism, as in the know fix, into RDF.  I think Jos has   claimed that he has proved something similar, if not the same as this,   works.  No one I have suggested this to has like it, usually for different   reasons.       <jenny> <ageA> "10" .     <ageA> <rdfd:datatype> <integer> .     <ageA> <rdfd:valueProp> <ageB> .    entails:       <jenny> <ageB> _:a .     _:a <integer> "10".      The Syntax Fix  ==============    This fix is based on the idea that viewing the problem as an entailment   problem is incorrect.  The real problem is syntactic.  It arises solely   from the fact that folks are currently used to writing in rdf/xml:       <rdf:Descrption rdf:about="#jenny">       <age>10</age>     </rdf:Description>    and it is suggested that they expect the age property to represent the   number not the numeral.    The suggestion therefore, is to fix this in the syntax.  If instead the   author writes:       <rdf:Description rdf:about="#jenny">       <age xsi:type="xsd:decimal">10</age>     </rdf:Description>    this should be equivalent to the following n-triples:       <jenny> <age> _:a .     _:a <xsd:decimal> "10" .    Could the xsi:type property be inserted by an XML Schema or a DTD?      The Abandon Hope Fix  ====================    To those who say I am showing a lack of neutrality in the choice of name, I   reply that I am, perhaps mistakenly, using a name that I believe will be   considered appropriate by many WG members.    If it is decided that the community cannot live without a solution to this   problem, and none of the other solutions are acceptable, then we reconsider   the tradeoffs that got us to this point.    I strongly suggest we do not abandon hope until after we have sought   community feedback on the current proposal.

Cute.    Side show just for fun: not the main thrust this response:  the domain of   rdf:type is rdf:Resource, right?  Therefore a fragment is also a   resource.  Therefore it can be named by a URI.  What URI?  If there was a   general way to turn a URI with fragid into a URI, we'd be fine?  The other   format would just be syntactic shorthand.      >My goal is to:  >  a) raise awareness about the problem while  >  b) maintaining backwards-compatibility but  >  c) lay the ground work for future WGs to fix this bug    Good goals.      >[...later...]  > > (d) choose namespace names that end in non-xml-name-characters  > > such as / # ?  >  >I think perhaps we should provide some warning about using # in namespace  >names, dependent on the resolution of rdfms-fragments.    The way I've been thinking about this is that (I think) I can see  a model for URI's with frag id's that would work for RDF as is.  We've passed this issue to the TAG for consideration.  If they rule  the right way we need do nothing.  If the rule differently, then  RDF will have to change, but it should have a solid definition of  what a URI plus frag id denotes to work with.    What I'd rather avoid is making a change, then having to change  again when the TAG rules, assuming it accepts the task.    You're approach of warning "here be dragons" is interesting.    I'd like to hear from the folks with knowledge of user communities  (PRISM, DC, CC/PP, ...) their reaction to this suggestion.  >  >you're-not-getting-off-that-easy-'ly yrs,    :)    Hmm, now I've got a list of actions somewhere that need doing ...

What are we to do Martin?  We have an objection which in part complains   that XML Literals don't support all of XML 1.0 since they rule out XML   that isn't nfc.  We are trying to find a way to be compatible with the   *current* xml spec i.e. allow all of it, whilst encouraging folks to   adopt the practice I18N recommend.    How should we respond to this objection?    Brian

Chapeau at a rakish angle (i.e. part on, part off)    Let me frame this discussion a little, and declare an interest.  I have   running, publicly available code with a user base.  The code has evolved a   lot over the past months, but I and the Jena team have worked hard to   maintain its external interfaces so that the running code of our user base   would not suddenly break.    I read M&S and it said that language is part of the literal, so that is how   I wrote the code.  In Jena, a literal is a pair, as defined in M&S.    The Jena team is committed to modifying Jena to track the decisions of the   WG.  Whatever decision the WG makes on this issue, we will   implement.  However, I would ask the WG, whether they feel that they would   owe me, and other developers, an explanation for why, having gone to the   trouble of implementing the spec correctly, we should be asked to change   our code.    To be clear Patrick,  I have not seen anything in what you have written   that  comes close to an explanation of why this change would be a good   thing.  If there is something I have missed, then could I trouble you   please to repeat it, or to provide a reference.  I am entirely open to   being persuaded by good reasons.  However, I do not consider, "because   Patrick says so" to be a good reason.    A good reason might have the form "If we do it as m&s says, problem x occurs".    [...]    >Then we need to modify the representation of literal nodes  >in the RDF graph to in fact be a pairing of string along  >with (possibly unspecified) language.    That would be an implication of not changing from m&s's current position.    Brian        

        It has been suggested that we adopt a common notation across all the specs   for representing triples.    I suggest we use legal n-triples with the addition that a URI can be   represented as a qname without angle brackets, e.g.       _:a rdf:type rdfs:Class .    The notation should be explained in the primer which should include a list   of standard prefixes.  The other documents should reference the description   in the primer.    Brian

      Hi Dan,    Dan Connolly wrote:    > > Changing the namespace is a significant step.  Is there any way to  > > avoid that?  >   > Of course: just make no changes to the language.    I'd like to make our assumptions/arguments explicit here.  I have two  questions:      o what changes can we make without changing the namespace URI?      o what are our goals for backward compatibility?    If we change the namespace URI, then old processors will not be able  process any rdf 1.1 data.  Maybe that will turn out to be unavoidable,  but shouldn't we look for more backward compatible solutions.    Lets take Graham's Qname issue as an example.  You rightly point out  that one can't tell the difference between a Qname and URI by just  examining the syntax.  But that doesn't by itself mean that nothing can  be done.    We could say that given xxx:yyyyyyyyyyyyy as an attribute value, then if  the xxx matches a namespace prefix decalared in the document and the  YYY... conforms to localname syntax, then this attribute value will be  interpreted as a Qname.    The main problem I see with this is backward compatibility.  An old RDF  processor would process say:      <rdf:Description rdf:about="rdf:Class">     ...    incorrectly.  It would be better if old processors barfed when  processing constructs defined in RDF 1.1 rather than processing them  incorrectly.    We could define a new namespace and use new attributes such as aboutQ in  that, but that has the problem that old processors will fail on new  data, even if they could have processed it correctly, e.g:      <rdf:Decription rdf:about="#foo">    ...    will fail if the rdf prefix is associated with a new namespace uri.    Another approach would be to put the new attributes in a new namespace  and leave the old ones alone:      <rdf:Description rdf1:aboutQ="rdf:Class">      ...    The problem with this approach is that an old processor will process it  incorrectly.  It will regard the rdf1:aboutQ as a property of an  anonymous resource.  Which is maybe not so terrible.    Another approach would be to add the aboutQ to the existing RDF  namespace.  This would have the advantage that processors which check  that they recognise names in the RDF namespace would barf.  From M&S:      When an RDF processor encounters an XML element or attribute name    that is declared to be from a namespace whose name begins with the    string "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" and the processor does    not recognize the semantics of that name then the processor is    required to skip (i.e., generate no tuples for) the entire XML    element, including its content, whose name is unrecognized or that    has an attribute whose name is unrecognized.    One would hope that the processor would not do this silently.  RDFFilter  barfs on the whole file.  I'm not sure what other processors do.    This last approach does mean adding a term to the RDF namespace.  The  M&S document makes no promises about not extending the namespace.  RDFS  does recommend that *schemas* should not be changed - new ones should be  created.  The motivation for this is to prevent existing things  breaking.    Could a case be made here that adding aboutQ to the RDF namespace would  give us better backward compatibility properties than creating it in a  new namespace?    This message isn't really about Qname attributes.  Its about what our  goals  are for backward compatibility.  The harm that creating a new namespace  as  a working hypothesis might do, is that we might not try as hard as we  should  not to need it.      Brian

        Sans chapeau:    My bath time this morning was spent thinking about social meaning.  I came   to the conclusion that 'meaning' is a difficult and slippery a concept that   we should try to stay away from, sticking to things that are more   concrete.  We should leave talk about 'meaning' to the   philosophers.  Perhaps we can get all we need by describing intended use.    And then I see this is exactly what Jeremy has done in his draft   alternative text.       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/meetings/tech-200303/social-meaning    This is a significant shift in approach that may have considerable merit,   and I wanted to draw attention to it.    The mininalist approach looks good too, though we might go a bit further:       1 An RDF triple is intended to be used to represent an assertion     2 A set of RDF triples is intended to be used to represent the   conjunction of the assertions represented by each individual triple     3 The assertion represented by an RDF triple is determined by the   specifications of its subject, predicate and object.     4 RDF triples representing false assertions SHOULD NOT be used to mislead.    The above being non-normative.    I'm not happy with 4.  RDF triples representing true assertions SHOULD NOT   be used to mislead either, yet "RDF triples SHOULD NOT be used to mislead"   is vacuous.  So maybe strike 4, though I'm inclined to leave it in.

        It looks like we need to make some minor revisions to the semantics doc.       DanC has asked for a WG decision to approve the change.    Eric, Sandro, will a decision at a telecon on 16 Jan 2004 be timely from   your point of view?    I think what we need is a clear description of the proposed changes for   review.  Pat, I see a proposal from you at:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2004JanMar/thread.html    Have you and Herman agreed to this?  I see Graham has reviewed it and is   happy with it.    If anyone has issues with approving this change, please raise them asap.    Brian

        Here is a strawman formal comment from RDFCore to the TAG concerning the     architecture document last call.    I would like to decide by email that the WG approves sending this.   Accordingly, I will send it on behalf of the WG if I hear sufficient   specific endorsement and have no unresolved objections by Tues 23 Mar 2004.    Brian      ===========    RDFCore would like to congratulate the TAG for making an excellent start   on documenting the principles that govern the design of the architecture   of the web.  We also recognise the great difficulty of the task the TAG   has taken on.    In response to the call for review of [1], several members of the   RDFCore WG have submitted many detailed comments on the document [2][3]   [4] which we hope the TAG will find useful.  We are confident the TAG   will give due consideration to each comment on its merits with or   without specific endorsement by the RDFCore WG.  RDFCore requests,   however, that the tag pay particular attention to comments that relate to:       - having a clear vocabulary and meaning for fundamentatal notions   such as resource, representation, naming, identifying etc.     - interpretation and use of fragment identifiers     - notions of authority and ownership of URIs and resources    We trust that the citation of the RDF Model and Syntax specification be   replaced with a citation of the new RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax   document [5] in due course.

Yup.  That looks like a reasonable policy.    Brian        

        I probably have my facts wrong - I haven't checked the documents:    There are two possible behaviours:    a) leave extra ".."'s in the path  b) delete extra ".."'s.    a is legal in 2396 and not in 2396bis  b is legal in 2396 (but not recommended) and in 2396bis    You are recommending we fix on a?

        I have uploaded the semantics last call candidate to       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/    and modified the overview page       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#documents    to refer to it there.    Seems to work.  Will other editors please upload there docs to the same   place when ready and let me know so I can update the overview page.    Brian        

        I've added these to the agenda as requested.

Converting this to a test case, (which may or may not capture Frank's   intended question), I suggest that an RDF processor is not required to   conclude       _:b rdf:type rdfs:Class .    from:       _:a rdf:type _:b .

Experiemental explanatory text:    [[    A resource of type rdf:Alt is an ordered collection.  A collection may be   given the type rdf:Alt, as opposed to rdf:Bag or rdf:Seq, as a hint to the   reader that typical processing by an application will be to select one   member of the collection for processing.  For example, a schema designer   might use rdf:Alt to represent the collection of mirror sites from which a   file may be downloaded.  In all respects, other than this hint, a resource   of type rdf:Alt is just like an rdf:Seq.    ]]      Brian

        Hi Dave,    Thanks for the speedy analysis.    As a general point,  I hope that the WG will respond warmly to the comments   we have received from the xml schema folks.  To my mind, there has in the   past been a gulf in our respective points of view, and I believe that with   a little care we may be able to build some bridges across that gap.

I suspect there is a spread of opinion   within that group and we can help by giving a clear explanation of why we   didn't use xsi:type.    So we can say that we didn't introduce rdf:datatype capriciously, but because:       - we use URIREF's not qnames as identifiers     - to allow qnames in just one attribute would have caused confusion and   we felt that introducing       the use of qnames throughout the syntax was beyond our charter     - and, as they point out, we allow datatypes not defined by xml schema     - we recognise the potential for confusion, we have explained as best we   can in the primer, but if they have other editorial suggestions, we'd be   happy to hear them.      >There is already discussion near figure 9  >   http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20030123/#figure9  >  >Summary: closed. explanation, no action  >  >  >  >ISSUE http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-09  >  > > "We were unable, on a first reading, to determine whether the default  > >    namespace declaration, and thus unprefixed names, were or were not  > >    allowed in order to encode 'RDF URI References'."

I think what they are getting at is whether or not QNAMES are required, for   example    <RDF xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">     <Description>       <value>10</value>     </Description>  </RDF>    is legal RDF but there are no qnames in it.  The text they quote:       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-intro    [[In order to encode the graph in XML, the nodes and arcs have to be   represented by XML element names, attribute names, element content and   attribute content. RDF/XML uses XML QNames to represent RDF URI References.   The namespace prefix part of all QNames is associated with a URI Reference   as defined in XML Namespaces [XML-NS]. The RDF URI Reference represented by   a QName is determined by appending the local name part of the QName to the   URI Reference associated with the namespace prefix part of the QName. This   is used to shorten the RDF URI References of all property arcs labels and   some nodes. RDF URI References identifying subject and object nodes can   also be stored as XML attribute values or XML element names via QNames. RDF   Literals (which are only object nodes) become either XML element text   content or XML attribute values.]]    left them unsure at first reading whether the above example was legal.  At   least that is my guess at what is being said, but it might be good to   confirm that.    If that is the concern, then a minor editorial change to the quoted   paragraph would clear it up.      >Summary: closed. explanation, no action  >  >  >ISSUE http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-10  >"cannonical syntax"  >  >Discussion of out of what I believe is out of RDF Core's charter,  >creating a new XML syntax or modifying RDF/XML (created 1998)  >to work with XML technology designed later.  >  >   "The RDF Core WG is neither chartered to develop a new RDF syntax,"  >   -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCoreWGCharter  >  >Summary: closed.  we don't have to do this, out of charter ??    I suggest we can agree that it is hard to process RDF with general XML   tools such as XSLT for the reasons they point out but that RDFCore decided   that this issue was outside our charter.  None the less we recognise that   there is some disquiet about the current RDF/XML syntax, we have tabled an   issue for consideration by a future WG and would hope that WG would welcome   involvement of the xml schema wg.  We could also note that the XHTML WG are   already considering a DTD friendly syntax for inclusion in XHTML documents   with the support and encouragement of the RDFCore WG.          >ISSUE http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-11  >"layering on xml"  >  >There is some explanation to do since they seem to have missed  >reading the Syntax Data model section in defining RDF/XML on top of  >the pile of XML technologies.  >  > >    Not only does this confuse levels and thus readers, it also runs the  > >    risk of inadvertently defining an XML subset.

The suggestion that the   syntax is defined at the character level seems just wrong.  It is also   noteworthy that the approach they suggest of considering a transform into a   canonical form is not dissimilar to the snail approach we considered, and   rejected.    This comment belongs in the category of "we would have done it   differently", which may be true, but there you go.  I think the response   might also include:       - agreement that layering of specs is important     - emphasis that unlike M&S the grammar is not character level, but is   built on top of an infoset     - acceptance that are other ways to do it, some of which we considered   (snail) and why we decided on this approach (the grammar is clearer)  >  >  >ISSUE http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#xmlsch-12  >"capricious syntax"  >  >Discussion and proposal for a better XML syntax (RDF/XML 1998) to  >better match the RDF concepts and abstract syntax (2002).

        Thanks Graham.

      Pat,    One of my tasks for today is to place pointers to editors drafts on the WG home   page.  Are you comfortable with having a pointer to your editor draft placed   there?  If so, is it possible to have a stable URL for it so I don't have to   keep changing it when we change versions (I notice what looks like a version   number in the one below).

Yes, that why its scheduled early.  We need a clear working model for how we  understand resources.  But I'm hoping to avoid a philosophical death spiral  on this one.  We need a model of resources that is sufficient to enable us  to progress.    > It's  > clear also that there's a question whether a `resource' as understood in  > RDF represents the bit-sequence (or the actual atoms) of a referenced  > entity or some sort of pledged token of good intent towards an  > significantly-invariant object.    Its exactly this sort of confusion that we need to clear up.  I don't  believe there is a question here, though there does tend to be some  confusion about this.  For example, RFC 2396 is quite clear that a resource  is NOT the bit sequence (or actual atoms).    >   > I wonder, given the need to emphasise the legal aspects of RDF  > assertion, whether we don't need to define resources reflexively to  > support this.    Lets try and stay away from the legal stuff if we can.

It means that `resources' get an RDF-specific  > definition.    Resource is a term widely used in the internet and on the web.  Lets be  careful about confusing everyone by having an incompatible definition.    What I'm hoping for here is something pretty simple that can serve as a  foundation on which we can build.    I recently tried to articulate the working model that I use and it came  out something like this:      There is a set of resources R.      Each member of R is identified by a URI by which I mean:        r1.uri == r2.uri <=> r1 == r2      i.e. two resources are identical if they have the same URI.    two resources with different URI's are different resources.      There is a set E of entities.  Entities are things like web pages,    numbers and trees in the park.      There is a mapping D : R -> E.  i.e. there is mapping which maps resources    to entities.      There is a notion of equivalence.      Two resources r1 and r2 can be mapped by D to the same entity.  In that case    we say they are equivalent.        equiv(r1,r2) <=> D(r1) = D(r2)      and finally:        D((p,s,o)) <=> D(p)(D(s),D(o))    I present this, not because I claim it is correct, it doesn't deal with frag  id's  for example, but to suggest a language in which we can be clearer about  what we mean.

On my list I currently have:    - xmlsch-02  - i18n update  - adequacy of rdf test cases (e.g. basic things in schema)  - bad test cases - Peter's message  - <br/> test case  - is rdf:datatype="&rdf;XMLLiteral" legal  - value space of rdf:XMLLIteral  - 5! NotAccepted on semantics doc  - unresolved comments on primer  - doc status    Brian

Or you could just infer that the value must be of that type as well.    Validation is kinda tricky in RDFS.  If I understand it correctly, RDFS has no   means of expressing negation, so can't express a contradiction.    You can define validation to mean that there is specific confirmation that all   domain and range constraints are met.  I guess that is what you had in mind.   RDFS does not currently define any concept of validation.      >   > This is of course, presuming that the type is defined locally  > and a range is defined, otherwise the test can't even be made.  >   > But this is a good thing.

In the case of the P proposal that is true, because RDF/XML does not allow   literals as subjects.  It is not true in the case of the S or X proposals which   permit the information needed to represent a lexical form to represented without   a schema.    It really helps understand these points if we are specific about which proposal   we are talking about.    Brian        

                               For the RDF Community to answer...    Question 1:    Given the RDF graph:    <rdf:RDF      xmlns:rdf  ="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"      xmlns      ="uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#">        <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Jenny">         <ex:age>10</ex:age>      </rdf:Description>        <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Film">         <ex:title>10</ex:title>      </rdf:Description>  </rdf:RDF>    Which of the following most accurately captures the meaning  expressed in the above graph?        1. Jenny's age and the Film's title are the same thing         which is represented lexically by the string "10".        2. Jenny's age and the Film's title are both the         string "10".        3. Jenny's age and the Film's title are (potentially)         different things which are represented lexically         by the same string.        4. All RDF Core WG members are bogshitters.    ---    Question 2:    Given the RDF graph:    <rdf:RDF      xmlns:rdf  ="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"      xmlns:rdfs ="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"      xmlns      ="uuid:f89496c0-82c3-11d6-9832-0003931df47c#">        <rdf:Description rdf:about="#age">         <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#integer"/>      </rdf:Description>        <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Jenny">         <age>10</age>      </rdf:Description>        <rdf:Description rdf:about="#Bob">         <age>            <rdf:Description>               <integer>10</integer>            </rdf:Description>         </age>      </rdf:Description>  </rdf:RDF>    Which of the following most accurately captures the meaning  expressed in the above graph?        1. Jenny's age and Bob's age are the same thing, which         is represented lexically by the string "10".        2. Jenny's age and Bob's age are both the string "10".        3. Jenny's age is the string "10" and Bob's age is         something which is represented lexically by the         string "10".        4. All RDF Core WG members are bogshitters.

Would there be an opportunity to introduce a URI form, similar to a same   document reference, but which is in fact a URI reference and whose   interpretation is modified by xml:base.

I don't believe use case was issue, that can be resolved   with b-node constructions.  The issue is that Nokia already have code/data   in this triple form and       a) they dissented to having datatyped literals without lang identifiers       b) WG members are sympathetic to Nokia's needs and are unwilling to rule   their data illegal    Brian        

      As the WG has outgrown the MIT teleconference bridge we were planning to  use, we have switched to a larger bridge:      +1 630 536 3003 room #3003    Brian        

      The usual weekly call for agenda items.  If there is anything you'd  like scheduled on the agenda, please get it to me by noon uk time  Thursday.    Brian

        When we got to processing last call issues, we increased the duration of  telecons to 120 minutes.  We've been doing that for quite a while,  perhaps too long.    I suggest that we see if we can move back towards 60 minutes by  scheduling telecons for 60 + an optional 30 minutes.  With a bit of  effort to say only what really needs said, and to say that briefly, we  can perhaps get through the business in 60 minutes.    Brian

No.  We decided to remove aboutEachPrefix from the language, but postponed   the issue so that a future WG may consider providing the functionality in   some other form.    >- rdf-containers-otherapproaches:  we've just decided to include a   >daml:collection like syntax    We have, but that is not the same thing.  This issue is about designing a   new container mechanism from scratch which might well have bag like things   done better.    Brian        

      If you have any items you'd like added to the agenda, please let me have  them by noon uk time Thursday.    I currently have a scribbled list of possibles which includes:       o primer subgroup report     o cycles in subpropertyof     o comment text in amp test case - resolved?     o literals proposal     o entailment tests     o tidying up broken test cases     o schedule     o document structure    Brian        

      Steve has just asked me if we have a template for meeting minutes.  We haven't  really up till now, but it seems like a good idea.    From a purely selfish point of view, I found the minutes produced by Jan      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0109.html    were clear and made it easier for me to produce the next agenda.  I  particularly like the way he identified new actions.  So I'm going  to suggest that as a guide for the future.    Graham - I wouldn't bother making any formatting changes to last weeks  minutes just to conform - though identifying the actions would be useful.    Brian

      Ok Jeremy,    As I understand what you are suggesting here, is that under TDL, the rule   could be rewritten to get the desired effect, i.e. reflecting the "literal   is a pair" directly in an extended n-triples represention:       <mary> <haircolor> (_, "red") .    and       ?x <haircolor> (_, "red") => ?x <rdf:type> <redhead> .    one can conclude:       ?x <rdf:type> <redhead> .

      Roland,    I'm writing to you to tell you about a decision made by the RDFCore WG,   because it has decided to delete a feature from the specification that I   believe that you use.    Para graph 196 of M&S       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#196    states:  [[  When an RDF processor encounters an XML element or attribute name that is   declared to be from a namespace whose name begins with the string   "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" and the processor does not recognize   the semantics of that name then the processor is required to skip (i.e.,   generate no tuples for) the entire XML element, including its content,   whose name is unrecognized or that has an attribute whose name is unrecognized.  ]]    The WG has decided to delete the effect of this text.  There is no special   processing of elements from the namespace whose URI is   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax.    The WG learned that the use of this namespace was not a typo as most, if   not all, implementors seemed to think.  Some change was necessary to   address the fact that most if not all implementations fail to implement it   correctly.  The WG decided there was no need for this mechanism.  The   namespace is reserved for W3C use and the WG decided that no names would be   placed in this namespace.    I hope that this decision is acceptable to you and that if you do use this   feature of M&S, you can find some other way to achieve the effect you   desire.  On the other hand, if this decision causes you difficulties, then   I encourage you to give that feedback to the WG on www-rdf-comments@w3.org.    Brian McBride  RDFCore co-chair         

        Somehow, I accidentally dropped rdf core off the distribution list for  this.    Brian  -----Forwarded Message-----    From: Brian McBride <bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com>  Subject: Re: Summary of strings, markup, and language tagging in RDF    (resend)  Date: 03 Jul 2003 11:50:35 +0100    [I've dropped Misha and timbl from the dist list - feel free to forward  this/reintroduce them if you feel it is appropriate]    Martin,    Thank you.  I found this message very helpful.  I realise you have made  these points before, and whilst repeating yourself is burden on you, I  found that collecting these points together helped clarify things in my  mind at least, considerably.    So, if I can try to summarize (at least my understanding) of the details  you gave (I've included some detailed comments amongst your text below,  but they are not greatly relevant, I think).      - users familar with XML will be surprised that the lang tag does not  affect an xml literal    - users will be confused that plain literals are treated differently  from XML literals    - the common case is that the user wishes an enclosing lang tag to  apply to an xml literal, so why burden the user with duplicating the  information    - not all XML languages have neutral elements such as <span> that can  be added to hold extra type information    - conversion from other XML languages to RDF/XML will require more  complex code    Now, here is an attempt to reconstruct a rationale for why RDFCore chose  the option it did.  I'm not writing this in any sense in a defensive  posture.  My view is that RDFCore simplified the handling of XML  Literals post last call and sought feedback from i18n whether it had  simplified too far.  I just want to get the arguments laid out so we can  all take an informed decision about that question.       - RDFCore had last call feedback, particularly from members of WEBONT  that the treatment of XML literals in the last call WD's was  unsatisfactory, particularly in the formal treatment, leading to a  desire for simplification and greater uniformity.  This is what led to  the post last call proposal.      - RDFCore considered retaining the wrapper element, but decided not to  because it is more complicated for *implementors* (I note i18n's  arguments are more user centred)      - It has been argued that there are cases where importation of the  lang tag is not desired, so why burden users with having to turn it off    Likely I need some help here to correct, clarify and complete.  RDFCore,  please chip in and I'll summarize again if necessary, afterwards.    I note that i18n arguments centre around a user writing RDF/XML by  hand.  I wonder whether some of the differences of view arise because  RDFCore expects RDF/XML to be largely written by machine.    Martin has rightly pointed out that there are several possible solutions  to the issue b), but I would like to be clear whether reintroducing the  wrapper element would be satisfactory.    Martin, in your opinion, would re-introducing the wrapper element and  having it carry any in scope lang tag address issue b) to i18n's  satisfaction?    A few minor comments interspersed below.

The explanation might be that parseType="Literal" indicates a standalone  fragment of XML embedded or quoted within the current document.  This  isn't strictly true in that a default namespace is carried in, but that  could be described as an exception.    XML isn't very good at embedding in itself - I think one of the reasons  we have this problem.

I personally don't see that argument.  I assume that data integration  would be done on the RDF graph, not in the XML syntax, so that issue  just doesn't arise.    Brian

I'm finding it increasingly hard to distinguish between   the different proposals, a fact I find encouraging in that I hope it means   we are moving to a synthesis of ideas.    sans chapeau:    Let me see if I've got this straight.    In the P proposal, two nodes in a graph might be labeled "10".  An   interpretation of one node could be the integer (10) (borrowing Jeremy's   notation) and the other might be the string "10".    In the PL proposal, two nodes in a graph might be labeled "10" and the   interpretation of both nodes must be the same string "10".  However, an   application may use other information, possibly represented in the graph,   possibly not, to 'interpret' that string as an integer, or not.    In the B idiom of the S proposal, two nodes in the graph might be labeled   "10" and an interpretion of one node might be the string "10" which is a   member of the lexical space of xsd:integer and of the other might be the   string "10" which is a member of the lexical space of xsd:string.  Given       foo bar "10" .    we need more information to figure out which "10" is meant, e.g. a range   constraint.    ok so far?      Dan has raised an issue, rephrased by Pat as how many triples result from   merging:       foo bar "10" .    and       foo bar "10" .    Peter Patel-Schneider, echo'd by Jeremy has raised the issue of   compatibility with xml:schema.  I personally feel there is an elegance to   Jeremy's proposal which has xml schema dealing with syntax and lexical   issues, and rdf schema dealing with data model issues.    A while back, Jan suggested putting the integer in the graph rather than   the numeral.  Hmm, I can't remember why that did not fly at the time.    Patrick has raised the issue of things getting rather messy if the lexical   representation of a value becomes separated from the mapping which defines   its interpretation.    And this led me to wondering about Patrick's suggestion that a literal is   in fact a pair.    So what if  ...                    we extended n-triples so that literals MAY have an   associated datatype.          <foo> <prop> xsd:integer:"10" .    If we don't know the datatype, we leave it blank:         <foo> <prop> _:"10" .    We can do inference:       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .     <prop> <rdfs:rangeLex> <xsd:integer.lex> .    entails       <foo> <prop> xsd:integer:"10" .    and also:       <prop> <rdfs:rangeLex> <xsd:integer.lex> .    entails       <prop> <rdfs:range> <xsd:integer.val> .    We can do simplification:       <foo> <prop> xsd:integer:"10" .    entails       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .    Some WG, to leave aside charter issues, could decided that the triple to   output for:       <rdf:Description>       <prop xsd:type="xsd:integer">10</prop>     </rdf:Description>    is       _:bnode <prop> xsd:integer:"10" .    What happens if we merge       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .    and       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .    Icky bit here: by rule we get:       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .    If we merge       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .     <prop> <rdfs:rangeLex> <xsd:string>    and       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .     <prop> <rdfs:rangeLex> <xsd:int>    the merging rule is, first run datatype inference to populate blank data   types then merge, which gives a merge of       <foo> <prop> xsd:string:"10" .    and       <foo> <prop> xsd:int:"10" .    which will give the right result.  Why do I have the feeling I didn't get   away with that bit.    No matter, completing the job:    Merging       <foo> <prop> _:"10" .     <prop> <rdfs:rangeLex> <xsd:integer>    and       <foo> <prop> _:"12" .     <prop> <rdfs:rangeLex> <eg:oct>    gives       <foo> <prop> xsd:integer:"10" .    or       <foo> <prop> eg:oct:"10" .    to a processor that 'understands' the xsd:integer and eg:oct datatypes.    Finally,       <foo> <prop> xsd:integer:"10" .    if and only if       <foo> <prop> _:v .     _:v   <xsd:integer.map> "10" .      Brian

Negative entailment tests       [[These tests are specified in exactly the same fashion as positive   entailment tests...]]    They aren't *exactly* the same, or we couldn't tell which is which.  Suggest:    [[  Negative Entailment Tests are specified with the same structure as positive   entailment tests except that a <test:negativeEntailmentTest> element is   used instead of a <test:postiveEntailmentTest> element.  ]]    Editorial:    I'd prefer that the examples were labelled as such, but this is not critical.

I believe that is correct, but we should kick either the minute taker (you)   or the chair (me) for not making sure this was clear :)    The proposed new text is a bit heavy.  I don't want to get to much into   wordsmithing, but there was some suggestion of adding a note that Qnames   don't have to have prefixes.  I wonder if it works:    [[  In order to encode the graph in XML, the nodes and arcs have to be   represented by XML element names, attribute names, element content and   attribute content.

      The message that raises this issue suggests that xml:lang attributes are  not represented in the model.    An interpretation of m&s is that a literal is not a simple string but is  in fact a pair of two strings (s, l), s representing the string value of the  literal and the l being the language encoding, e.g. the value of  an xml:lang attribute.    With this interpretation, we would need to modify n-triple so that it  could represent the pair, not just the literal string.  Personally,  I've been writing:  "string"-"lang", but I'm not precious about the  precise syntax and would be happy for one of the N3 designers to  propose something in keep with the langauge design.    This issue is related to:      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literals-as-resources    I'll something more about that in a separate message.    Brian

Yup - we are headed into "what exactly is a resource" territory here.  Lets do   datatypes first.    Brian        

      Roland has provided an interesting example of the use of   rdf:aboutEach.  They key point is the use of an anonymous resource in the   body of the aboutEach.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2001OctDec/0379.html    Brian        

      I wasn't clear enough before.  Roland is relying on:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#196    [[[When an RDF processor encounters an XML element or attribute name that   is declared to be from a namespace whose name begins with the string   "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" and the processor does not recognize   the semantics of that name then the processor is required to skip (i.e.,   generate no tuples for) the entire XML element, including its content,   whose name is unrecognized or that has an attribute whose name is   unrecognized.]]]    What he is doing is:       o writing an html document     o embedding some RDF in it which does not get rendered by a         browser     o including in the middle of the RDF inside the html          <rdf:html> some html here </rdf:html>         which causes the browser to render the "some html here" and       is ignored by the RDF parser.    I bring this to the WG's attention because para 196 is relevant to this   issue, and also Roland's use of this is unusual.

It was never my intentiont tht _:q and _:qq denote the same resource.  One denotes a buyer service.  The other denotes a seller service.  However, a broker might usefully note some things in common between  these two descriptions.    A broker might 'know' that there is profit to be made introducing  two services, one a buyer and the other a seller of the same product  where the quantity constraints are compatible.    > Agreed, though that isnt the key issue here.

Quite right I wrote with my usual fuzzy lack of precision.  However,  the point I was trying to make remains valid.  RDF is not about a  truth preserving logic system which preserves truth in any interpretation.  Its about expressing facts with one interpretation.    > The key issue is who is doing the binding.

You have incoming RDF/XML off the wire - is it Owl FULL, DL or Lite?    I was imagining that the abstract syntax might be a good abstraction on   which to build an implementation.  So if your implementation is based on   the abstract syntax, you'll need to translate incoming rdf/xml into that   syntax for processing.    But I'm out of my depth here.

      Hi Jos,    With regard to the recent discussion with Jan, I think there might be  some miscommunication.  What I think than Jan is saying is that, given  the model:      <http://descr1> <http:/prop> _:anon .    <http://descr2> <http:/prop> _:anon .    it is not possible to express this exactly in the RDF/XML syntax.    The reason is that the only way this can be done is to assign an ID  or a URI to the anonymous resource.  That 'resource' then ceases to   be anonymous.  In effect, it is no longer a variable.  Try   translating the above n-triple example to RDF/XML and you will see   what I mean.    Reading your message again, maybe I get an inkling of what you are  saying.  We are talking here about what is an anonymous resource.  We have been saying that it is an existentially qualified variable.  I have been understanding that to mean that it denotes some specific  resource with certain properties, i.e.      _:anon <rdf:type> <rdf:Class> .    says there is some specific resource, _:anon, which has type class.  Is that what you would call a 'constant'?  Ah.  This is beginning  to make sense to me.  If it were a constant, then you wouldn't  mind at all that a URI had been assigned to it.   That would not  change its nature.    I think you may be saying that what I thought of as a variable  is not really a variable.  It does not bind to multiple values.  Instead it represents a single value (constant) though I don't  know what the value is.   Hmmm.  Now consider:       5+x=1    Is x a variable?  No.  Its an unknown, until I solve the equation.  Have we been calling anon resources variables, when we should have  called them unknowns?    If what I previously thought of as a variable, is not really a  variable, how would you explain what a variable is, without  having to refer to concepts defined in a logic layer above  rdfcore?

It does look like an editorial change to me and worthwhile if it assists   pfps in accepting the disposition of pfps-15.    I have a problem with the sentence:    [[  It is not a goal that RDF cannot prevent anyone from making assertions that   are nonsensical or inconsistent with other statements, or the world as   people see it, and applications that build upon RDF are expected to find   ways to deal with incomplete and conflicting sources of information.  ]]    The complexity of the sentence, the double negative at the start bother   me.

[[ i.e. assertions of named properties about identified things.]]    Do we still talk about assertions?    I suggest dropping the last two paragraphs.  These get us into murky   waters.

RDFCore are aware that the current OWL specs rely on the presence of these   triples, but it has been suggested that this dependence could easily be   removed.    RDFCore would prefer to accept the comment and remove the triples and   therefore urge WEBONT remove their dependence on the presence of these triples.

If so, are there any literal character sequences which *cannot* be   > sent through RDF/XML? Or does XML provide an escape for every Unicode   > code point?    We discovered last week that there are some UNICODE characters (ascii  control codes e.g. bel) which are not legal in an XML document.  We have  to decide whether they are legal in the graph, and thus not expressible  in RDF/XML, or just not legal in the graph.    I guess you would like us to make this decision quickly.    My instincts are to not allow XML special cases to pollute (sorry value  laden term) the graph syntax, so I'm for saying that any UNICODE  character sequence is legal and noting there might be problems  serializing in RDF/XML.    That said, you (Pat) commented this would make expressing the semantics  more difficult, in that not all plain literals without lang tags would  denote xsd:string's, requiring you to have a more complex rule in the  semantics doc.    I wonder whether we really need that rule.  Would it suffice to *note*  that most plain literals without lang tags denote xsd:string's, but that  due to the fact that some UNICODE sequences are not legal xsd:string's,  not all plain literals without lang tags are xsd:string's.  This is  something that should be straightforward to implement in an xsd  reasoner.  We could do a couple of simple test cases.    So I'm suggesting no rule and a warning note.  As always, the WG  decides.    Brian    ps: test case:    _:a <rdf:label> "\0007" .    entails?    _:a <rdf:label> _:v .  _:v <rdf:type> <xsd:string> .

Rewriting to check I've understood:    Untidy semantics requires the content producer to be explicit about the   datatype of a property value.  This will have the benefit of detecting   errors that would otherwise not be noticed, e.g. when one system processes   something as a string and the other as an integer.    I think I'm missing something here and explaining it right.  Comparing the   tidy and untidy semantics in this case.    Tidy semantics:  Type of object of a property is Literal.  System A asserts   range of property is xsd:string.  Thats a type class.  System B asserts   range of property is xsd:integer.  Thats a type clash too.    Untidy semantics:  Type of object of a property is a Literal.  System A   asserts range of property is xsd:string.  Systems continues just   fine.  System B asserts range of property is xsd:integer.  System B   continues just fine.    I guess I've got the scenario wrong.  Can you explain the one you had in mind.      >You appear to have missed one very important issue, namely,  >  >Probable Schism of the RDF Community  >--------------------------------------  >  >If tidy semantics is adopted *and* those applications which are  >already deployed which employ inline literals with value-based  >semantics (Adobe XMP, CC/PP, DC, RSS, etc.) refuse to change their  >serializations for reasons of practicality (and that is likely to  >be the case), then these applications will have conflicting and  >non-monotonic interpretations of the RDF compared to the RDF MT.    I did try to capture what I think is the technical issue here, that in   cases like bitPerPixel, with tidy semantics a generic RDF processor will   not be aware of the integer "nearby" to borrow DanC's phase.  Checking the   summary:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Sep/0251.html    Yes, section 2, principle of least change is intended to capture that.  Not   satisfactorily I guess.    I think the point here is that with untidy semantics it is easier to   retrofit datatype information to existing content.  If we don't do that,   then there is information we are not capturing in the RDF, i.e. that a   generic RDF processor, rather than one with specific application knowledge,   will be aware of.    If that capture the idea, I will try to rephrase to make it more clear.    Again, I'm not sure that I've got your full point though.  You use the term   "schism" which to me is about the community dividing into warring   camps.  Is that what you intended to suggest?  If so could you amplify a   little.      >The RDF MT will say that a given inline literal denotes itself,  >the string, yet the application may say that it denotes something  >else -- thus, entailments that hold for the RDF MT may not hold  >for the application MT and visa versa.    What application model theory.  I can point to the model theory for   RDF(S).  But I'm not aware of any application model theories.    >Furthermore, higher level  >or client applications which wish to interact with RDF knowledge  >expressed according to these value-based models will not be able  >to utilize generic RDF tools and inference engines because they  >will not behave correctly according to the value-based semantics.    Right.  To strengthen this point, are you aware of any concrete, pragmatic   examples where this really matters.    Brian        

        Where are we on this?  I find this thread incredibly hard to follow.

Its editorial.    Personally, I'd rather not change anything now - this isn't critical.   But I won't stand in the way of the editor/DanC making this change in   the publication process.

        Good advice.  I just had a helpful chat with Eric from which I came away   thinking that the key thing we need to do is prioritize.  This sounds   like a good way to prioritize.

Eric, please did I understood you correctly at the last telecon?

This text does not make it clear, at least to me, that a literal can have  a language component as described in:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#221      The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to associate    a language with the property value. There is no specific data model    representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to the data     model); the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part     of the literal.    >   > >     which should make it clear that a literal is not just a simple string,  > >     but a compound structure including an optional representation of a  > >     language encoding.  >   > it already says that a literal isn't just a string.  >   > >     It should be noted that other parts of the text of the specification  > >     may need similar clarification.  > >  > >   o that n-triple be modified to represent the language encoding of a  > >     literal  >   > Why? n-triples can repesent pairs already, using triples.  > I find that option much more appealing.

True, but in the f2f proposal it was suggested that they would because the   denotation is a function of the literal and the property, i.e.    >>   <s1> <p> "lit" .  >>   <s2> <p> "lit" .    |=     <s1> <p> _:l .     <s2> <p> _:l .        >  Put another way: if all literals are tidy, then all literals in   > containers must be tidy.

I'm really suggesting that the model theory is all we are going to say about the   meaning of RDF.  What the law chooses to do about folks who put RDF statements   on web pages is a matter for lawyers and politicians, not for us.    Brian        

        Hi Folks,    I just chatted with Pat about moving to closure on the semantics doc.  He   is going to be travelling and is somewhat connectivity challenged, so I'd   like to see if we can agree what changes need to be made by close of   business Monday.    Looking at the reviews we have had:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0306.html     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Dec/0324.html     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0000.html     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0003.html    Jos and Jan report no show stoppers, and Graham raises:       1. some instances of rdfs:XMLLiteral       2.  Section 4.3, rule rdfD4 has a conclusion:      aaa rdfs:subClassOf eee .  that I think should read:      ddd rdfs:subClassOf eee .    I believe I also spotted another typo:       rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Property .    where the rdfs:Property should be rdf:Property.    I believe all of these fall into the category of trivial fixes:       typos, links and formatting errors.    and propose that Pat feel empowered to fix such errors at his discretion.    Then just remains the issue that Peter has raised about rdfs:Literal       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0014.html    about which we await a response from Pat.    Graham, if there are any of the discussion issues you raised that you think   are potential showstoppers, please could you identify them asap.    Subject to a satisfactory resolution of the issue raised by Peter, I hope   that this will enable us to make a last call decision on the 17th.    Brian        

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.    We don't seem to have much incoming comment to deal with.  I don't have   other agenda items to table myself, so I'm considering cancelling but do   send in suggestions if there are things you wish to discuss.    Brian        

      There has been some confusion over the production of the minutes for last  weeks telecon.  Graham has sent me notes below, which are incomplete.

DanBri: "this is a production where the rdf:ID names the resource pointed to,  not the reified statement"  Reason:  production in which rdf:id names object resource, not statement      4. Discussion of repeated ordinal container-membership properties (rdf:_n, etc):    Brian to rephrase the proposal so that it doesn't put higher-level validation  requirements on a parser  ACTION: Brian          (action w.r.t test case 2) [?]    Jos:  raises problem with anonymous nodes  [Scribe: not quite sure what the  problem is]  Test case includes single element -- empty <rdf:li/>.

Jan on xml:base    Would like to have some way to attach base URI to RDF documents ... xml:base may  not be the right way to do this (yet).  We may need to leave this for now, and  revisit later    Proposal from Ron, response from Danbri.  Danbri was probably too enthuisastic  for using xml:base, but is less so in light of Ron's comments    Need a clearer line on interaction with xml:base when RDF is mixed in non-RDF  XML documents    Ron:  maybe this is defined w.r.t. RDF processing, rather than document URI    Maybe the RDF spec should be revised to not say relative URIs are w.r.t.  document URI, but some compatibly-derived base URI?

That is my interpretation of current usage.  So in an api, I have:       stmt.getSubject()     stmt.getPredicate()     stmt.getObject()    to deconstruct a statement.       stmt.getResource    does not make sense.    Brian

OK, so because its a neg entailment of the empty graph, then by this rule,   there can be no valid interpretations.  I thought the model theory had bad   datatype lex forms denoting something though, in which case there is an   interpretation.  Right, from 3.4 of the MT:    [[For any typed literal "sss"^^ddd in G, if I(ddd) is in D and 'sss' is not   a valid lexical form for I(ddd) then IL("sss"^^ddd) is not in LV]]    and    [[(this) condition requires than an 'ill-formed' typed literal, i.e. one   where the literal string is not in the lexical space of the datatype, not   denote any literal value.

I see what you mean here, and I agree with it, though I think you express   it a bit too forcefully.  There was no model theory in M&S at all, but   folks seem to have managed to do useful things with it.  Thus, even without   model theoretic semantics, the reification vocabulary can be used, and   provided you understand the semantics attached to it by a particular   application, then you can do useful things with it.    But I agree with you, that it defines no semantics that apply across the   board to all applications.      >If we go for "statement" (answer "Yes" to Q1 in [1]), we get a (rather  >painful, admittedly, but endorsed) way of referring to statements found  >on Web pages and in RDF databases, recording provenance etc. This is IMO  >much more concrete and useful that just providing no definition at all,  >although the usability of 4-triple reification still remains seriosly  >hampered by its verbosity.  >  >In summary, if we go for "stating" we have *no* official mechanism for  >reification.

However, there has been talk on this list of some   folks getting together and proposing new vocabulary, possibly publishing as   a note.  That could be a way forward.    There has been strong support in the WG for the position we have now   reached.  I have not officially closed the issue, though I plan to put it   up for closure this week, if Frank agrees that is appropriate.    Brian

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon,   which I need by noon, uk time Thursday.

      I'd like to seek advice from the WG on how to handle feedback on  RDF Comments on WD's that we publish.    The entrance criteria for a WD to go to last call includes:       formally address all issues raised by Working Group participants,     other Working Groups, the Membership, and the public about the     Working Draft.    I'd suggest that feedback can be divided into two broad groups:       o minor nits, typo's etc that the editor can simply deal with     o more substantive issues that require discussion/resolution by       the WG    If we look at any issue raised on RDF Comments, I suggest we need  to be able to identify one of:       o the raiser of the issue withdraws the issue (this doesn't have       to be a formal withdrawl e.g. "ok - I see" sort of response       would do       o a commitment by the editor (or delegate) to fix in the next       version (for minor nits)       o a commitment by the editor to add the issue to the issues list       for the document (more major issues)    Would it be a good idea for document editors, one month after publication  of a WD a summary of the substantive feedback recieved.    Brian

        Steve,    On Friday's telecon, you stated as a requirement:       [["Inline" literals are required, don't care about model theory]]    What exactly did you mean here.  I thought at the time you meant that we   get rid of non typed literals, but maybe you meant something else.    Brian

      In principal, I think that would be an excellent idea.    Jeremy, please could you suggest a statement of purpose for the meeting and   objectives, and possibly an agenda.    Do we do this a small subgroup from RDFCore meeting with the i18n folks or   as the whole WG.  Who from RDFCore would like to participate in such a   discussion on RDF conformance to charmod?

      I have been considering, whether in the light of events this week, I should  cancel the telecon this Friday.    The advice I have is that folks would prefer it to go ahead, so that's what  I'm planning to do.  The agenda will be out soon.    Brian

Eric,    My interpretation of the discussion and decision from the face to face was   that the WG felt there were a number of things without a proper home, e.g.   the graph syntax definition.  I confess I've felt for some time that the   asymetry of having a schema spec, but nothing similar for the rdf model   indicated a problem.    The decision we made, as I recall it, was to sketch out the contents of a   document to describe the, oh I want to use the term "model", but Pat will   jump on me if I do and I don't have a better word for it yet, but I hope   you know what I mean.  The idea in my mind is that we look at that plan and   see if it makes sense.    Another option we rejected was to combine this document with the schema   spec, an option we might reconsider when we see the contents.    We were aware of the impact this might have on the schedule when we   discussed this.    Brian

Right.  We have two possible meanings of rdf:subject and we have to choose   which one rdf:subject means and leave the other one for a different vocabulary.    Dan's statement implies that the reification support in RDF/XML is of   little/no value to him, since he'd lose that switching to another   vocabulary.  Is that true of others supporting the 'object of rdf:subject   is a URI' position?    We have two different things to say and we could use two different   vocabularies to say it.  The things that distinguish the rdf:subject   vocabulary is:       o there is syntactic support for it in rdf/xml     o there are existing implementations.    Brian        

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon   where I'll be in the chair.    I expect the main focus to be on preparing for a second last call.  To   that end I expect to discuss:       - what needs to be done before second last call     - what external dependencies we have (e.g. responses from xmlsch)     - how long we should wait after announcement for comments on recently   published WD's     - schedule for producing LC docs    Brian

I think I  meant to write:    IEXT : P -> powerset(R x R)    i.e. IEXT is a mapping from from P to relations on R - the  idea being to ensure that R x R is not a subset of R.    Is that the same as you are suggesting?    Brian

I'm not sure why one would want this, however.    Some folks have expressed a preference for being able to use a single URI   as both the class and the interpretation property.    Brian

Sounds like a go ahead to do this Jan.  Its borderline whether its editors   discretion or not, but I think its ok.  You should respond on comments, on   the same thread, accepting the change, adding [closed] to the subject   line.  I'm not planning to allocate an ID for this one.    Brian

        We have had quite a few regrets and no suggestions for the agenda so I   am cancelling this Friday's telecon.    The following Friday, 24 Nov is the day after ISWC.  I will be   travelling that day, and in the conference the three days before, so   regrets from me.    I suggest we consider that telecon at risk for now.  We can see if next   week if a possible agenda is shaping up.  Early indications of any   regrets would be helpful.    Brian

      Hi Art,    I am very sorry that we are to lose you.  You have been stalwart in supporting   the development of RDF, both before the WG was formed and within it.  I am sure   I speak for us all when I express our thanks for your efforts and support in our   endeavor and best wishes in the future.    Whilst we have said that we would allow a week for a review of a new WD before   publication, it would be fitting if we could approve publication of your latest   version at this weeks telecon.  I therefore propose to put that on the agenda.    Can I have at least three WG members to help out by giving the updated document   a detailed review in time for any *essential* changes to be made before the   Friday telecon.

I have advice about how to communicate   the datatyping decision to webont that required waiting for the publication   of the WD's.  We are now ready to do that, but I'd like to do that first.    Brian        

        Pat, Peter,    You will have seen that RDFCore has just published a new set of WD's -   note these are not last call WD's.  I'd like to discuss with you how   best we might move on to producing new last call documents.    The sort of thing that I have in mind is to see whether Peter could do a   detailed review, particularly of the semantics doc before a second last   call, so that we can go into a second last call knowing that any issues   remaining are those on which we just don't agree.  I've also suggested   that rather than discussing comments by email, organising a telecon to   focus on review comments could speed things up.    If this approach is agreeable to you in principle, then the next step   might be to agree a plan/schedule.    Brian

Then comes schema concepts like Class, domain  > etc. Then come layers for container, reification, etc.    That sounds like a good approach.  There has also been past discussion  on rdf-interest about separating model and XML syntax.  Would it make  sense to define a core in terms of graphs, with a simple triple syntax  suitable for formalization.  Then the RDF XML syntax can be defined in  terms of a translation to the simple triple syntax, and so can any  other syntax.    >   > This will help us put RDF on a firmer logical basis, help explain it,  > help implementations, ...

I'm hopeful that we can restructure the specifications and the  conceptual  model of RDF along the lines you suggest, without breaking so far from  the current specifications that we would want to rename it, or even  changing the namespace for that matter.    Brian

      Jeremy,    You wrote:    -------------    Brian:   > I guess this sort of test case does not fit the "here's the RDF/XML, this   > is what it means in n-triples" pattern very well    In testing ARP I work through a zip file finding all pairs of RDF and NT  and check they are the same.  I noticed that this test case still supports that.    I think it is important that someone wishing to run automated tests off  the test cases should be able to, without having to code in lots of  specific filenames.    I note that the zip file version is more useful than the web version for  automated testing, since it is fairly hard to automatically work through  all the files in a web directory.  ----------------    Your noting is noted.  Did you have a specific suggestion in mind?    Brian

It isn't built into RDF, for sure.    Absolutely.  Some systems will have built in knowledge of what  the properties, types, etc actually mean and how to process them.    >   > Pat  >   > PS.

      I received the message below from a member of the new Technical   Architecture Group.    I'm thinking of sending a response along the lines of:    I would like the TAG to define the foundations of the architecture of the   web.  The concept of a resource is fundamental to web architecture, yet it   is very hard to pin down exactly what it means and how it relates to the   concepts of URI, URI reference and namespace.  I suggest the TAG publish a   W3C recommendation containing a description and a formal model explaining:       o what is a resource     o How URI's relate to resources (e.g. can the same resource       be named by more than one URI)     o what is named by a URI reference and how does this relate to resources     o what is a namespace and how do the names within it relate to URI's and URI       references     o the operation of the http protocol within the context of this model.    I would welcome comments on the above and other suggestions in response to   the TAG's request.  I can respond with either a suggestion from the WG as a   whole, or with a collection of suggestions from individual members of the WG.

The last subcase is:      <rdf:Bag rdf:bagID="e3"/>    The presence of the bagID triggers the reification of statements in the  description and placing them in the bag.  In paragraph       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2001Jun/att-0017/01-rdfms.html#p228    it states:      A Description expressed in typedNode form by production [6.13] is     equivalent to the same Description expressed by production [6.3] ...    Therefore this statement is equivalent to:      <rdf:Description rdf:bagID="e3">      <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Bag"/>    </rdf:Description>    and thus a reified statement of the rdf:type statement should be placed in  the bag.  Unless  I have missed something, that is what the statement you are  asking about does.    Brian        

      Dave Beckett has asked me what the process is for handling feedback on WD's.    Does anyone know what the usual practice is?    I'd expect something along the lines of:     o Editors should subscribe to www-rdf-comments@w3.org   o Responses to comments on a particular WD should come from the editor(s)     of that WD or someone they delegate to.    We need to decide what to do about the issues list.  Editors can either  maintain their own issues lists or pass issues to me and I will continue  to maintain the central one.  FWIW I'm planning to extend Jema to  include some support for issues management.  If its gets robust enough,  maybe we can put it up on a server somewhere.    Brian

The logic survives, as best I can understand it, but is this the   behaviour we want to specify?  Would someone ever want to build a language   on top of RDFS which had some notion of a TOP property.  If they did, what   would the implications for datatypes be?    Are we willing to accept the constraint that all subProperties of a   property must have the same datatype constraint?  Or is there some magic in   the model theory that can allow them not to?    I need to find time to sit and think about this.    Brian

        Pat,    Now we are in last call, we have to be a bit more disciplined about   handling comments.  We discussed the process for handling last call   comments on Friday's telecon.  To some extent we are figuring it out as we   go along, but here is the gist of what I have in mind:       o comment arrives in www-rdf-comments@w3.org     o if its an "immediate response" e.g. "we say that in section xx.yy"   then the editor responds pointing this out and hopefully the commentor   agrees and that's all very lightweight.     o if its not an easy response, the editor requests a comment id from me,   and the comment gets added to the lc comments list:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/     http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/issues.rdf      o such comments are discussed by the WG and a disposition agreed, actions   recorded and feedback sent to the commentor, who may accept the resolution   or raise an objection.    I've got a couple of concerns about this at the moment.  It puts me as a   bottleneck in allocating id's.    There have been occasions in the past where corrections have got   lost.  We've got make sure that stops happening.    Brian

Right, though DanC has been suggesting we consider that we two types of   literals, each a pair of the literal and the string, one is a bare literal   and the other is an xml literal.

I've generally assumed the reason for using rdf:_n properties for bags was  that a graph was considered to be a set of statements, and if one wanted the  same object in a bag more than once a simple membership property wouldn't  do.  Was this part of the original WG's thinking or no?  I'm just curious.    Brian

        We have a request to review the new charmod drafts.  Any volunteers?    Brian      -------- Original Message --------  Subject: Upcomming Last Call for Character Model: Fundamentals  Resent-Date: Mon, 16 Feb 2004 16:17:02 -0500 (EST)  Resent-From: chairs@w3.org  Date: Mon, 16 Feb 2004 16:16:45 -0500  From: Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org>      Dear Chairs,    This is a heads up. The Internationalization Working Group has been  working on addressing last call issues on the Character Model. As a  result, we have decided to split the Character Model in two, resulting in:    Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Fundamentals   and  Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Normalization.    We plan to publish both of them soon, 'Fundamentals' as a last call  working draft, and 'Normalization' as a simple working draft. The  last call for 'Fundamentals' is planned to be short, because the  intention is mainly to allow previous commenters to make a  cross-check of the changes we have made, which we think were all  tweaks rather than big changes. Of course, new comments can also  be made, but we do not plan to cover any new topics.    The current plan is to start the last call on February 25 or 26,  and to have it run for three weeks, ending on about the 17th of March.    Please tell us if this is too short for you and in that case how  much time you/your group would need. The groups that have commented  on the last last call are (this new last call is not limited to  these groups):         * DOM WG (no comments)       * HTML WG       * QA WG       * RDF WG       * TAG       * WAI PF WG (no comments)       * WSArch WG       * XForms WG (no comments)       * XML Core WG (no comments)       * XMLP WG       * XML Query WG       * XML Schema WG       * XML Sig WG       * XSL WG    (from the end of http://www.w3.org/International/Group/2002/charmod-lc/).      Regards,    Martin.

        Tim,     From your response, it is clear that there is still more work to do to   help you understand the WG's position, but perhaps it is time to cut to the   chase.

This is the question that is at the heart of the judgement call the WG had   to make.  Leaving aside the question of charter, should the WG pull   reification entirely?    People are using it.  If reification is withdrawn, that use is rendered   non-conformant.  There is nothing currently to replace the   functionality.  We are weighing that against the difficulties that   reification causes.    We could take on the issue and propose a 'proper' solution.  But this is   not a simple problem space.  You talk as if 'quoting' were a simple thing,   but there are different forms of quoting and we ought to understand how   they relate to contexts and the like before picking a solution.  We have   already established that the current vocabulary is inadequate for the form   of quoting you desire (handling b-nodes and the difference between a URI   and a literal).  We would have to consider not only the use cases you have   in cwm, but also the original motivation - provenance - which takes us into   the triples or quads discussion.    This is not easy.  RDFCore has been running for two years - I suggest it   needs to finish what its got before it embarks on exploring those murky   waters.  So proposing an alternative reification solution is not an option.    Which leaves us with a choice between:       - withdraw the reification vocabulary, leave nothing in its place for a   while and render those       who use the current vocabulary non-conformant       - reduce the prominence of the current vocabulary, but leave it in place   for those who are       using it, and clarify its specification    Might you be persuaded that in these circumstances, the best course of   action is to leave it to a new, fresher WG to consider these issues and   that that WG would be best placed to decide how to move current use to   whatever solution they propose.    In the meantime, the best strategy for the current WG is to reduce the   prominence of the existing vocabulary, whilst at the same time clarifying   its specification for those who have chosen to use it.    Brian

In recognition of the low turnout, we decided that we   would hold off sending out announcements of decisions reached to allow time   for those not present to comment should they choose to do so.

      Ok - lets close it. Oh bother - Jema can't do 'closed' yet.    This action is closed on the grounds:     o it can't happen     o we will be revisiting reification in the model theory sometime soon     anyway - several folks have expressed a desire to discuss it.

Thus an RDF model is not contrained to have the containermembership  properties contiguous starting from rdf:_1. Changes to the Model and Syntax  specification have been proposed.    with a reference to:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0039.html    >Chairs? help?

So why are we mentioning them?    There are two questions we can ask here.    A)    Is " 3 " in the lexical space of xsd:decimal?    If asked, I'd be very surprised if anyone in xml schema answered   anything other than no.    B)    What is the value of the property in       <rdf:Description>       <eg:prop rdf:datatype="&xsd;decimal"> 3 </eg:prop>     </rdf:Description>    We had informal indications at last weeks telecon that the xml schema   WG, looking at question B, were going to be seriously unhappy with the   answer the current specs give.    Accordingly, jjc was actioned to draft an alternative that would allow   he answer to B to be 3.  This was so that we could take a look at it and   have it ready should we get a formal comment from the xml schema folks.    [...]    >   > I'm sorry, but was this decided during the last telecon?

      Thank you Jos!    Observing, and to some extent fearing, the nature of the recent datatypes   discussion, I was wondering if we could bring some more structure to it by   asking for a test case.  Then I saw this message from Jos and thought this   might be the basis of a test case we could decide on.  Is it?  Is there an   entailment test here?

I think we are agreed then, that the WG is aware of no reason why the   syntaxes could not be enhanced to support tidy literals as subjects.    The original resolution text was:    o the WG notes that it is aware of no reason why literals should not be   resources and a future WG with a less restrictive charter may extend the   syntaxes to allow literals as the subjects of statements.    Since literals are tidy, I think, strictly this covers it.  Are you happy   with this text now, given that we are clear.  If not, then I think it might   best just to delete it.    Brian

Interesting - similar idea - treat all literals as XML but you've got it   a different way round somehow.  How do we distinguish between text and   markup e.g. how to I represent the book title       The <b> Element Considered Harmful    where "<b>" is in bold?       _:a eg:prop "The <b><b></b> Element Considered Harmful" .    which could be written in rdf/xml as       <rdf:Description>       <eg:prop>The <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> Element...     </rdf:Description>    or       <rdf:Description>       <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal">         The <b><b></b> Element Considered Harmful       </eg:prop>     </rdf:Description>    Hmmm, but you would allow "<" as a legal rdf literal lexical form and   the other design didn't.  That means we can't treat all rdf literals as   xml.  So how do we know when they are and when they are not?    >   > I think there remains a question:  can parseType=Literal be used in   > conjunction with rdf:datatype=...?

        Tim,    Reviewing the content of this thread, I believe you make the following points:       A it is not clear to you why the WG chose the current reification proposal     B cwm uses reification in a manner that is not consistent with the   current definition     C the current reification proposal is a barrier to adoption of RDF and   it might be better dropped.    Concerning A, the WG were considerably influenced by Ron Daniel's assertion   that the intent of the original WG was to provide a mechanism to support   provenance.  The use case that was highly influential is as follows:    Consider the following 2 graphs:    Graph G1:    _:s rdf:type rdf:Statement .  _:s rdf:subject subj .  _:s rdf:predicate pred .  _:s rdf:object object .  _:s foo:saidBy fred .  _:s foo:saidIn doc1 .    Graph G2:    _:s rdf:type rdf:Statement .  _:s rdf:subject subj .  _:s rdf:predicate pred .  _:s rdf:object object .  _:s foo:saidBy john .  _:s foo:saidIn doc2 .    Merge the two graphs and then determine who said what, where.  If the _:s   nodes in each graph denote a statement (as opposed to a stating), it is   identified by its subject predicate and object properties which would allow   the two _:s nodes in each graph to be merged.    The WG concluded that if reified statements denoted triples, rather than   occurrences of triples, the scenario above would lead to many modelling   errors and further confusion.    I hope this example goes some way to persuading you that the WG is not   entirely off its trolley in making the proposal that it has.    Concerning B, you note the current proposal is unsuitable for the ways it   has been used in cwm.  That may be so, and therein may lie a clue that the   representation of rules was not what it was designed for.    The WG was aware of issues such as the "{ }" mechanism in cwm, the desire   to represent graphs within  graphs and the notion of contexts.  It decided   that this area was beyond the scope of its current charter and has recorded   an issue for consideration by a future WG:       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-contexts    I fear this is not a trivial area into which to venture.    You note that if the current vocabulary were defined as you would prefer,   then new vocabulary can be defined to represent the other meaning.  That   argument is two edged.  Can you not define new vocabulary to represent the   concepts you use in cwm just as well?  I was wondering whether you also had   a solution for b-nodes as the objects of the reification triples.    As for C, dropping reification all together.  Reification does cause   confusion and the WG did consider this option, but we do know that people   use the current reification machinery.  The note on the RDF schema for P3P   for example uses it (though I doubt anyone uses the note) and in the jena   project we know that people use it because not only do we get support   calls, but folks asked for us to ensure we kept the Jena 1 optimisations   supported in Jena 2.    The WG compromised and decided try to marginalise reification to "just   another bit of vocabulary" as far as it can.  It is not part of the   concepts document and is mentioned in a low key way in schema.  It has to   be acknowledged that its special treatment in the syntax means that it is   singled out to some extent.  But then, various interesting alternative   approaches to RDF syntax are gaining traction.    Hopefully, careful explanation in the primer will minimise further confusion.    Brian

We have agreed that contexts are out of scope.    True, but if contexts would fix it, maybe we must revisit that   decision.  Why bodge things now and then provide a better mechanism   later.  (And yes, I'm still concerned about getting done soon.)    Brian        

            -------- Original Message --------  Subject: Re: Another RDF Comment on the OWL Reference Doc  Date: Thu, 19 Jun 2003 10:40:10 +0100 (GMT Daylight Time)  From: Sean Bechhofer <seanb@cs.man.ac.uk>      Brian    Thanks for your comments [1].    [[  owlref-rdfcore-relationship-to-RDF    RDFCore are concerned about the clarity in the OWL specifications of what  RDF is legal OWL DL and OWL lite.  This seems to be described only in S+AS  which is a highly technical document and is likely to be inaccessible to  many.  On reviewing the reference document some significant restrictions  were not apparent to the RDFCore reviewer.  We cannot be confident,  therefore, that other restrictions we would care about, have not been  missed.    RDFCore requests that the specifications be amended to include a  description of necessary conditions for a RDF document to be in OWL DL and  OWL Lite.  This description should be as accurate as possible consistent  with a goal of it being comprehensible to a majority of the community.    Such a description may bring to light further issues.  ]]    An appendix has been added to the OWL Reference Doc (Appendix E: Rules  of Thumb for OWL Ontologies [2]). This appendix is intended to address  precisely this issue: which RDF graphs are legal OWL DL and OWL  Lite. Of course this is not intended as an normative description --  the finer details are still contained within the S+AS. However, the  appendix presents some general rules which, if followed, should ensure  that graphs are legal DL/Lite. Rather than providing a formal  characterisation of DL/Lite, one can view the philosophy of the rules  as "if you follow these, you'll be ok.".

The output language it produces is as       follows.  Each statement is output as a statement element.         The subject is represented by an attribute, either subjURI if the       subject has a known URI, or subjANON if the subject is anonymous.       The value of a subjRes attribute is the URI of the resource.  The       value of the subjAnon attribute is a generated id.         [@@TODO It doesn't currently handle aboutEach and aboutEachPrefix        distributed referents properly.  For now, it just outputs a        single statement for each with either a subjaboutEach or        subjaboutEachPrefix subject.]         The predicate of the statement is represented by two attributes,        ns and localname.  The value of the ns attribute is the URI of       the namespace of the predicate.  The value of the localname       attribute is the localname part of the Qname representing the       predicate.         If the object of the statement is a literal, the value of the       literal is represented as the content of the element.  If the  object       has an associated language, the statement element has an xml:lang       attribute whose value is the encoding of that langauge.         [@@TODO xml:lang processing not done]         If the object of the statement is a resource, then the statement       element will have either an objURI attribute or an objAnon        attribute.  If the object of the statement is an anonymous       resource, then the statement has an objURI attribute whose value       is the URI of the resource.  If the object of the statement is       anonymous, then the statement element will have an objANONn       attribute whose value is an internal identifier of the resource.         Examples:         <Statement subjURI="http://aldabaran.hpl.hp.com/bwm"                  ns="http://aldabaran.hpl.hp.com/ns/"                  localname="root"                  objURI="http://aldabaran.hpl.hp.com/" />         <Statement subjANON="1"                  ns="http://aldabaran.hpl.hp.com/ns/"                  localname="title"                  xml:lang="en">The value of a literal object, possibly                  including markup</Statement>      <Statement subjANON="2"                 ns="http://aldabaran.hpl.hp.com/ns/"                 localname="identity"                 objANON="2"/>    The tranform which follows is not a parser.

That looks like a possible compromise - language of the form "SHOULD be   in NFC" rather than "MUST be in NFC, as I suggested later in my email:    [...]    >>  >> I also wonder whether this issue might be addressed by toning down the   >> language from MUST to SHOULD e.g.  >>  >> [...]  >>  >>> which includes the additional following para:  >>> [[  >>> The string in both plain and typed literals is required to  >>> be in Unicode Normal Form C [NFC].

I think we've had that in a comment from them.  They pointed out, as I  understand it, that whitespace processing occurs before the lexical form  is determined, thus "3" is a member of the lexical space of decimal, but  " 3 " is not.        <foo xsi:type="xsd:decimal"> 3 </foo>    is legal because the spaces are discarded as part of determining the  lexical form.    The RDFCore WG agreed that it required the exact lexical form when it  approved the xmlsch-02 test case.    I suggest this fits the be precise what you produce and forgiving in  what you consume model.  When generating RDF/XMl, make sure you don't  include the white space, to produce a correct document.  But when  processing incoming RDF/XML, you can be a bit more forgiving.    Brian

I haven't followed this thread in detail, so may be off base, but in  this last message I see something that may be relevant.    Martin's use of the terms "interpretation" and denotation may be  different to ours, as suggested elsewhere by Pat.  Perhaps we have not  made clear, what I'll loosely call the substition rule.    Martin, the issue is one of round tripping.  Given the following input:    <rdf:Description>    <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><em></eg:prop>  </rdf:Description>    If the xml literal *denotes* the character string "<em>", and in,    <rdf:Description>    <eg:prop><em></eg:prop>  </rdf:Description>    the plain literal also denotes the character string "<em>", then it is  legal for an RDF processor to substitute one for another, e.g. an RDF  copy program could read the first of these and write the second because  their semantics, according to RDF, are exactly the same.    I don't think anyone wants that.    Martin: does the "substitution rule" explain why the denotations must be  different?    Now, Martin may have spotted something we have missed.  I suggest a way  to describe this clearly.  We have three concepts, concrete syntax  (rdf/xml), abstract syntax (closest rep is n-triples) and denotation.   This can be described in a three column table, concrete syntax, abstract  syntax and denotation.    I think what we have at the moment is:    Concrete Syntax                 | Abstract Syntax       | Denotation  -----------------------------------------------------------------  <eg:prop>a</eg:prop>            | "a"                   | "a"  <eg:prop><em></eg:prop>   | "<em>"                | "<em>"  <eg:prop pt="L"><em></eg:prop>  | "<em>^^rdf:XMLLiteral | C("<em>")  <eg:prop pt="L">&</eg:prop> | "&"^^rdf:XMLLiteral   | C("&")    I've abbreviated rdf:parseType="Literal" to pt="L" to fit on one line.   C(x) is cannonicalization of x, encoded as a UTF8 octet sequence, e.g.  C("&") is the octet sequence corresponding to "&".  The relationship between the abstract syntax and the denotation must be  functional - i.e. there is only one denotation (per interpretation) for  any given fragment of abstract syntax.    The point I made above, is that for any two rows with the same value in  the denotation column, it doesn't matter what form of concrete syntax  one uses - they have equivalent meaning and one can be freely  substituted for the other.    Brian

In the MT I was very explicit that that class contained   >literal *values*, not literals.    Yup.  Oh bu**er I see what you mean.  Or do I?  There is a value space for   rdfs:XMLLiteral, say XMLVAL..  There is the set of things that literals   (not the XML variety) denote, say LITVAL.  The  class extension of Literal   is XMLVAL union LITVAL.  Does that work?    >  I was expecting a backlash, but nobody noticed :-).

I don't follow that one.  We have been careful not to say whether literals   are resources or not, but we all know they are really.    Brian

      In respect of the action from the last telecon:      A9: Brian McBride edit the errata per the resolutions above; i.e. those      regarding                      #rdf-ns-prefix-confusion       CONTINUED. [ArtB to work with Brian to get Brian write access to      to the errata and to determine a strategy for maintaining the      appropriate documents.]    Art and I have discussed how to document the WG decisions, taking a number  of factors into account:      o Updates to the M&S errata document are normative.  It would be      sensible to get some feedback from the community before taking      that step.  Further, as we resolve issues, we will discover       dependencies between them, e.g. the decision to remove      aboutEachPrefix affects rdfms-namespace-prefix-confusion.  It is      undesirable to keep changing a normative document.      o We felt that maintaining the status of issues in a single document      would help to ensure a consistent representation of the status of      issues was maintained at all times.    As I reported at last week's teleconference the M&S errata document:      http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/errata    has been updated to refer to the issues list:      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/    The issues list document structure has been changed, with a section  'Attention Developers' which summarizes the decisions that affect  developers and has links to further more detailed information.    I'm trying to find a good balance of ease of maintenance for the WG and  effective communications with the RDF community.    Please review the issues list format and share your comments.  I have  scheduled a short discussion for the telecon on 8/Jun 2001, if there is  time at the end of the agenda.    Brian        

      Art,    This is terrible news.    I haven't had a chance to work out a coordinated response with Dan; I'm  sure he'll reply independently.  But here's my take.    You are not an HP representative on the WG, you represent the W3C team  and as far as I'm concerned you are still a member of the W3C team (anyone  who thinks otherwise, please go on vacation) and are one of their  representatives on the WG.    I do not intend to accept your resignation until we have had a chance to  first ensure that you did not offer it based on a misunderstanding and  secondly figure out if we can work out a way that will enable you to stay   with us.    You are an important member of the WG.  You have long experience of RDF, both  practical and theoretical.  You have a key role to play in developing the  new specifications, not least your work on n-triples, the test cases and  more just this week on the strawman test cases draft.    Can I ask you please to put this on hold till we see how things work out  over next days.

        Hi folks, this is the usual call for agenda items.    We have comments on the architecture doc outstanding but only have one   of the reviews in so far.    I am inclined to cancel and arrange another in two weeks time.  But   please feel free to suggest items for dicussion this week.    Brian

      Hi Folks,    I think we've decided to hold the RDFCore f2f meeting in June at HP's   offices.  Julie has gathered some hotel information for folks, which I've   copied below.    HP is located to the north of the city.  Folks have a basic choice to   make.  Do you want to stay in the centre of the city where there are pubs,   restaurants etc nearby, or do you want to stay within walking distance of   HP, in a rather bleaker environment.  If you stay in the centre, then HP is   about a 20 minute cab ride away.    HP folks visiting often stay at the Marriot.  The Holiday Inn near HP is a   new Holiday Inn Express.    I imagine we will organise a dinner though it will likely be self   funding.  If folks choose to stay in the centre, then we'll probably have   dinner in a restaurant there.  If you choose to stay close to HP, then I'd   suggest dinner at one of several country pubs nearby, provided there are   enough cars/drivers to get us there/back.

That question doesn't seem to me to accurately capture the concern.  The   answer is obviously no, since several bnodes in a graph may denote the same   value, but that does not get at the essence of Jeremy's issue.    Doesn't Jeremy's entailment capture the issue well enough?    Brian        

      Looks like I'm chairing the telecon this Friday, so this is the weekly call  items you like to see on the agenda.    Brian        

        Great stuff Pat.  I will upload the latest version so the WG page points  to it as the ed's working draft.    Re issue closures:    We closed horst-01 last week so thats done and you can send the  response, but you need to add a link to the decision.    Regarding the others, since we don't have a telecon this week, is there  anything to be gained by asking the commentors whether they would accept  the proposed resolution in the meantime.  If there are some minor tweaks  or discussion to be had, this could be done in the meantime.

Wow.  That's effort above and beyond in that we'd previously agreed that  n-triples, as a format for representing test cases, need not concern  i18n.    DanC has explained why it is the way it is.  Unless I hear a howl of  protest, I consider this comment closed.    >   > We do not think it is a good idea to have more escaping than  > necessary.

It was pointed out that  > a quite probable way to read "N3" is as 'n-triple'    Really?    I've just asked half a dozen people to pronounce 'N3'; people unfamiliar  with SW.  They called it "n-three".  I asked several of them if they  might have said "n-triples" (out of earshot of the others) and the  general response was "don't be silly".    The participants were all brits except one american.  could be a  cultural thing I suppose.    This wasn't exactly a well designed human factors experiment - but I  found no evidence of confusion.    >  (rather than  > as 'n-three'). It was suggested that choosing a different name  > than N-Triple would avoid (or would have avoided) such kinds  > of confusion.    Changing a name can also cause confusion.  I've seen no evidence to date  of the present name causing confusion, nor is there anything in your  comment beyond speculation that it might.  N-triples has been so named  for quite a while now with no complaint.  Weighing the non-zero cost of  changing it together with the possibility of the change creating the  very problem that it seeks to avoid against the evidence that a real  problem exists, I think its unlikely that the WG will want to take this  comment any further.    Say now if this is not acceptable.    >   >   > Personal comment: Both of the above comments seem to at least  >                    point to the need for a strong warning  >                    "Warning: N-Triples in not N3".    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples begins:    [[  N-Triples is a line-based, plain text format for encoding an RDF graph.  It was designed to be a fixed subset of N3  ]]    Is that sufficient?    Brian        

      Hi folks, this is the weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.   Please let me have them by 10 am uk time, Thursday (a bit earlier than usual due   to other commitments).    My informal list of possibles includes:    Responding to Pat's request to decide whether graphs 'are' sets or bags.  Plan   to base proposal on Jeremy's text.    Closing off syntax issues as per Dave's message.  I'm inclined to start with   section 2, those we consider out of scope and then do section 1.  The idea is to   avoid getting into detailed discussion; but to do those we can all quickly agree on.    Datatypes:  Please can we keep pushing this forward.    Primer update    schema update    syntax update        Brian        

      Frank,    At its teleconference on Friday 13th July 2001, the RDFCore working  group formally acknowledged receipt of this document.  The preliminary  minutes of this meeting can be found at:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jul/0148.html    We have taken an action to assess the contents of this document and  to give a first response by the end of this month (July 2001).

          -------- Original Message --------  Subject: Actions/Decisions from RDFCore WG Telecon 2001-10-12  Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2001 16:03:23 +0100 (BST)  From: bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com    Jema noted the following actions during RDFCore WG Telecon 2001-10-12    2001-10-12#1:  pat review d&r test cases  2001-10-12#2:  art review d&r test cases  2001-10-12#3:  jos change test cases to use example.org  2001-10-12#4:  gk to bring this back to table  2001-10-12#5:  frankm respond to gk text  2001-10-12#6:  jos send interpretaion properties URL to list  2001-10-12#7:  sergey sumamrise this issue fo rnext weeks telecon    Jema noted the following decisions during RDFCore WG Telecon 2001-10-12    1:  accept art's proposal  2:  agreed test cases subClassOf  3:  approve test cases        

      The model theory defines an interpretation for a single statement.  We also  need to formally deal with sets of statements i.e.    {s1, s2, ..., sn} is true under an interpetation I if and only if each si  is true under I.    Depending on our decision about anonymous resources we may also need  an interpretation statments containing them.  Only the subject case  is shown here - the others are similar:    _:a <p> <o> . is true under an interpretation I if and only if      p and o are members of U and    there exists ?a such that ?a is a member of R and                              (?a, IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(I(p))    And finally (I don't know how to say this formally) the scope of  the names of the form _:name is a set of statements.    Brian

Please could you hold that thought for now.    My preferred approach to this discussion is first of all to determine  whether the simpler, and I suspect less controversial, solution of  reintroducing the wrapper would satisfy i18n so far as issue b) is  concerned, which I'm hopeful it would.    RDFCore can then decide whether to accept I18N's arguments that the  present design should be changed.  *If* they do, then they can decide  how best to address those requirements.

        Jim, Guus,    RDFCore has an issue       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#timbl-03    raised by TimBL       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0586.html    Basically this issue is that when we have a parseType="Collection" each the   b-nodes that forms the backbone of the list has an (?bnode, rdf:type,   rdf:List) triple.  Tim's complaint is that these triples are unnecessary   and would like them removed.    I believe that RDFCore are sympathetic to removing them, but are aware that   Owl currently relies on them.  The semantics editor has stated that he is   opposed to our removing them.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Apr/0273.html    We also believe it would be technically possible for Owl not to depend on   them, but this would require a change in the webont specs.    Dan Connolly currently has an action to determine what it would cost to   remove Owl's dependence on the presence of these triples.  I am under some   pressure from our syntax editor, for whom this is the last remaining issue,   to get it resolved.    I believe that a decision from WEBONT either that they are willing to make   the necessary change that  would allow us to remove these triples, or that   they are not would swing the RDFCore decision and enable us to proceed.    Would it be possible for WEBONT to consider whether they might remove their   dependency on these triples?  RDFCore would very much like to make a   decision at this Friday's telecon.  Would it be possible to provide   guidance to RDFCore in that timeframe?

      FYI, the following can be found in section 6 of M&S:      The xml:lang attribute may be used as defined by [XML] to associate a    language with the property value. There is no specific data model    representation for xml:lang (i.e., it adds no triples to the data model);    the language of a literal is considered by RDF to be a part of the literal.     An application may ignore language tagging of a string. All RDF applications    must specify whether or not language tagging in literals is significant;     that is, whether or not language is considered when performing string     matching or other processing.    at    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#221    Brian    Brian McBride wrote:  >   > The message that raises this issue suggests that xml:lang attributes are  > not represented in the model.  >   > An interpretation of m&s is that a literal is not a simple string but is  > in fact a pair of two strings (s, l), s representing the string value of the  > literal and the l being the language encoding, e.g. the value of  > an xml:lang attribute.  >   > With this interpretation, we would need to modify n-triple so that it  > could represent the pair, not just the literal string.

The question of layering has been made many times by many people.  The RDF   schema approach is unusual and it is not uncommon for folks, e.g. those   familiar with UML, to ask "why did you do it differently".  I was kinda   hoping there was a relatively simple answer to that question.  And if there   is, I see no reason for not offering it in response to this comment.

      Dan Connolly wrote:  >   > [-cc www-rdf-comments; I wonder how much crossposting is wise;  > chairs? any opinions?]    When an issue is added to the issues list, a reference to the message  triggering it is also added.  Sometimes there is some immediate  discussion on rdf-comments clarifying the issue, maybe stating initial  reactions.  I think this is helpful and a reasonable place to have that  conversation.    A possible guideline is:    Discussion with raiser of issue on clarification/ initial disposition of  the issue should be on RDF Comments.  Once issue ID generated, take it  to WG or interest lists.    It was good the way you included the issue reference in your message.    It would be good to adopt some convention of including references to  issues in messages so that we can dig them out more easily later from  archive.  Does anyone know enough about how search engines work to  suggest a good way to do that.  Google didn't do what I wanted when I  searched for      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-qnames-as-attrib-values    is gave me all the references to the whole issue document.

If this needs clarifying, I suggest we do so in last call, and as Patrick   says, as part of clarifying the class hierarchy of xsd datatypes.    Brian

Let me make the following points:       1) We have more important things to worry about than this, so lets not   spend too much energy on it.       2) RDF is effectively defined by its abstract syntax and a model theory   therefore it is a language, or close enough for an introductory sentence.       3) If we are into "my text is better than yours" and arguments over   style, I don't think I've got the energy.  I've suggested it would be good   to have a common one sentence "RDF is ...".  I've made a   suggestion.  Hopefully we can at least all agree its not a data model.  If   any editor feels that his text is sufficiently better that it justifies   being different then just go ahead.    Brian

One of my comments on the schema draft that I have sent to Dan is that's   not what I recall the WG agreeing, but I confess I haven't checked the   record yet.    Brian        

        For longer than I can to admit, I've been manually copying actions from the   minutes of telecons to *RDF* based actions list manager.  For various   reasons that I won't go into, I've decided to automate that process, but   doing so would benefit from some help from the scribes.    At       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/scripts/minutes2n3.py    is a short script that will extract RDF based data from the minutes   provided they conform to some simple rules described below.    I have a servlet, swebscrape, currently behind our firewall, but I'll see   if I can do something about that, given some input (a post or a URL), looks   for a line of the form:    swebscrape:N3:python: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/scripts/minutes2n3.py    I'd appreciate folks including this line at the bottom of the minutes.    If it finds one it retrieves the script given by the URL, runs it on the   input data to extract some RDF.  The 'N3' indicates the output format and   the 'python' indicates the script language.  There are some mechanisms to   constrain this apparently dangerous running of arbitrary code (hint: that's   why the script is in python)    I'm interested if anyone knows of anything similar to this - e.g. tags in   html head elements to point to, say xslt scripts to extract the data.    Do let me know if I'm off my trolley again.    Brian    Format for actions in the minutes    o ACTIONS are introduced by lines of the form:    ACTION 20030411#1 bwm a description that fits on this line only    o 'ACTION ' must be at the beginning of a line.  'ACTION: ' also   works.  This introduces a new action.    o there must be a line of the form    date: 20030411    or whatever the right date is before any new ACTIONs    o ACTION's with an ID that doesn't match the date string are ignored, at   present    o Action ID's are optional - the script will generate one if its missing    o Scribes, please be careful if you do an action summary not to create a   duplicate of each action.    o Only one line is processed for each action - so please keep the action   description to one line

      Fixed.    However, I've noticed an error.  The original issue was raised, not about  subProperties of subPropertyOf, but of subProperties of subClassOf.    I think we need to bring this one back and specifically deal with the actual  issue raised.    Sorry folks.  My fault.

Resolve that rdf:li elements will be translated to rdf:_nnn elements  when they are found matching either a propertyElt (production 6.12) or a  a typedNode (production 6.13).    This change is made because:     o the container specific productions in the grammar are redundant and     add nothing to the language.       o The container specific productions fail to recognise subclasses of     container.      o The current specification is unclear about how to process rdf:li     elements which are not propertyElt's recognised within a container     specific  production.    An advantage of the decision is that rdf:li elements can be used to  number members of sub-classes of containers.    There are test cases in:      http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/    This closes these issues.

        The last call comments period has closed.    However, some of you may have noticed that we have not yet received   comments from XML Core, the URI folks, I18N, XML Schema or SVG.    I suggest:       - we proceed according to a previously agreed schedule     - we make best efforts to deal with late arriving comments       but set an expectation that comments arriving after this       week are less likely to get attention     - Eric has agreed to chase the other WG's and encourage them       to get their comments in this week    This means that editors may begin discuss editors drafts in public, but   please keep this lo key for now (RDFCore and Webont lists only) as we   clearly don't have all the comments in yet.    This week we need to be dealing with the incoming comments on the mailing list.    Please can we get these either closed or on the main comments list.    Brian

RDFCore agrees that there are good reasons for not using rdf:datatype   rather than xsi:type.    We agree with XML Schema that one reason is that RDF is not restricted to   using datatypes defined by XML schema, but allows other datatypes   conforming to the xml schema model for datatypes.    Another reason is that no other RDF/XML attribute takes qnames as   arguments.  Allowing this in one specific case is also likely to cause   confusion.    Whilst RDFCore would have preferred to not to introduce a different   attribute, it's judgement was that the solution proposed in the last call   drafts is the best of the options available.    To minimise any confusion, RDFCore has carefully described the correct   syntax in both the primer and the RDF/XML syntax documents.  We further   note that incorrect use of xsi:type where rdf:datatype should be used will   be recognised as a syntax error by RDF parsers.    Please reply, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org whether this response is an   acceptable disposition of your comment.    Further, more detailed explanation is given below.    ]]    In what follows, you give a lot of detail, which may be over-egging the   pudding rather.

        Graham,    Thanks for the review.  Detailed comments below.

        One of the questions that came up when I talked to webont about datatypes   was why we were using rdf:datatype and not xsi:type.  I couldn't remember   the reason at the time, but I do think we need to have one.  Can someone   remind me please.    One that now comes to mind is that xsi:type can take qname values and we   need a URI for the datatype, and the standard namespace ref for xsd: does   not produce the right uri.  Also there is the potential for confusion if we   have one attribute that can take qname values and none of the others do.    Brian        

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.    I have in mind to address outstanding technical issues that have arisen in   the rush to get the WD's out and also to address any issues of document   structure and overlap, the goal being that each team of editors is clear   about what needs to be done to their document to get to last call.  Off the   top of my head, the issue I am aware of what namespace XMLLiteral goes in,   I'll search the lists for others tomorrow, but it would be very helpful if   folks would let me know any they are aware of.    I'd also like to discuss issue tracking on the docs from here on in.    Brian

Maybe we could just try to say it more gently.    This specification allows an implementation some freedom to choose exactly   what string it will use as the lexical form of an XML Literal.  Whatever   string an implementation uses , its canonicalization (without comments, as   defined in ...) must be the same as the same canonicalization of the   literal text l.  A minimal implementation is to use l without change.    Brian

        Richard, Martin,    After some discussion today, whilst no formal decision was taken, the   RDFCore chairs indicated they "were minded" that there should be a   second last call on the RDFCore specs.    We are aware that the I18N are unhappy with the current RDFCore design   for handling lang tags in xml literals.    Are there any other aspects of the current design as expressed in the   current editors drafts, for example the relationship between plain and   xml literals, that you would you like RDFCore to address.    It would clearly be helpful to us to be able to address any such   concerns before publishing new documents.    Brian

Ah, thanks for this.  I was wrong earlier.  The intersection semantics   still apply.  In my earlier example, I was thinking that given       IEXT(A) = {a}     IEXT(B) = {a, b}    then b became a legitimate value of prop.  That is wrong, yes?    Is there a reason why we would care?    Is the course allowing max flexibility not to have it.  If webont want it   they can add it.  If we do it and they don't want it, they can't take it away.    Brian

        This is very much a strawman - intended to provoke suggestions for   improvement.      In       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0025.html    I18N made two post call comments.    The comment makes two points.    Regarding the first:    JJC has proposed that the value space of XML literal is not a character   string, and thus (if that proposal is accepted) the point is moot.    Regarding the second:    If the user wishes to have a language tagged string without markup, they     should use a plain literal.    We accept that the recent change to require that language tags be   represented explicitly within an XML fragment is less convenient.   However, we believe that this is outweighed by the confusion that is   likely if xml literal is made a special case.  We note that we received   feedback prior to last call requesting that xml literal be treated as a   datatype.  We note that the value space of the datatype is a fragment of   canonical XML and the canonicalization spec supports the RDFCore   position that a surrounding lang tag is not part of a canonicalized XML   fragment.   http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#XMLCanonicalization    Brian

      I took an action to draft a partioning of our problem space.    RDFCore: A base abstract syntax and a semantics for it.  The abstract syntax  is equivalent to n-triple (can n-triple be that abstract syntax).  Nothing  more - does not include type, containers, reification.    RDFSchema: Schema as currently conceived.    Vocabularies (aka standard library): Reification and containers    RDF/XML: Syntax considerations only.  Defines the language using some  suitable mechanism (not necessarily BNF) and defines (formally?)  a transform from RDF/XML to n-triple.    With RDFCore, Eric's suggestion to set a goal of having draft document  to discuss at the face to face is an excellent one.    With an eye on the calendar, would it be possible to move forward on  any of the other areas in parallel?    DanBri - do you think that progress can be made on schema, or is it  too dependent on the core?    On the syntax front, would it be possible to investigate how best to  specify the language and its transformation to n-triple?    On the vocabularies front, can we make progress with reification based  on Frank's questions or should we wait till the core is further along.    Brian

What you say of m&s is true.  However, this is an argument by ommission.  One can't expect M&S to have provided examples of every possible use  of RDF.  Is the interpretation suggested in the use case inconsistent  with M&S?    You are suggesting an interpretation of RDF  where the binding of an anonymous node to a specific resources occurs say   "at the time of writing" of the RDF/XML.  Is that right?   An anonymous  resource denotes a specific object - yes.  Is that consistent with  the interpreting them as existentially qualified.    >   > Looking at this the other way, it seems to me that the specific offer in  > Brian's example could just as easily have been expressed using an  > anonymous resource, e.g.:  >   > #offer890 :inResponseTo #advert123;  >           :instanceOf   #advert456;  >           :description  [:product :roses;  >                          :quantity [:units :kg; :value "200"]];  >                          :deliveryTime [:units :days; :value "2"];  >                          :deliveryMethod "TNT";  >                           etc ]  >   > which translated is:  >   > <#offer890>  <foo:inResponseTo>  <#advert123>  > <#offer890>  <foo:instanceOf>    <#advert456>  > <#offer890>  <foo:service>       _:service  > _:service    <foo:product>       <foo:roses>  > _:service    <foo:quantity>      _:q .  > _:q          <foo:units>         <foo:kg>  > _:q          <foo:value>         "200"  > _:service    <foo:deliveryTime   _:t .  > _:t          <foo:units>         <foo:days>  > _:t          <foo:value>         "2"  > _:service    <foo:deliveryMethod "TNT"  > etc.  >   > This conveys exactly the same information, with the exception of an  > explicit URI for the service.

This is an interesting distinction.  If the seller provides an independently  verifiable URI for the service, then the seller is not free to switch  the actual service which delivers.  If the seller provides a anon node  or a skolemized name, then they can 'cheat'.    Is that another use case?

"it is expected" is  anticipating discussions the working group hasn't had yet.  Perhaps something  like:      Note that there are other issues relating to aboutEach and aboutEachPrefix.

I agree.  Remember, we specifically drew your attention to this change  because we felt it was important that i18n review it.    > Also, I do not exactly agree with your summary of the situation on a).    Noted.  However, turning to the higher priority issue b), I suggest we  lay out the issue (I've taken a stab) and that we analyse the pro's and  con's of the WG's decision.  Largely, I suggest we do that with test  cases and use cases.    To RDFCore I say, Martin and his colleagues on I18N are experts in these  matters.  I strongly encourage listening their *arguments* with an open  mind.    Given as an example:    <rdf:Description xml:lang="en">    <foo:prop parseType="Literal">      <em>chat</em>    </foo:prop>  </rdf:Description>    <rdf:Description xml:lang="fr">    <foo:prop parseType="Literal">      <em>chat</em>    </foo:prop>  </rdf:Description>    Your contention, I think, is that users familiar with XML will be  surprised that these two statements have the same object; that the outer  xml:lang does not affect the object of the statements.    Martin: is that the sum of your objection?  Can you provide better  examples that clearly indicate the force of your argument?    RDFCore considered a number of options, but the relevant ones were that  the object of the statement should either be one of the following xml  fragments:    <wrapper xml:lang="en">    <em>chat</em>  </wrapper>    or     <em>chat</em>    The former carries the enclosing lang tag, the latter does not.  The WG  preferred the latter, though, as I recall, this was largely an aesthetic  judgement.    I'm going to make a trawl of the email archives this morning and see if  I can lay out the various pro's and con's, but I'd sure be happy if  someone beat me to it.    Brian        

        Pat,    How is the response to this coming along?    Brian        

        4.5 parseType="Literal"    The RDF/XML syntax is designed to make it easy for the values of  properties to be fragments of XML.  Whilst this feature is may be used  with arbritary fragments of XML, it was designed specifically to enable  the values of properties to be rich text represented as XML markup.    For example, A publisher might maintain RDF meta data that includes the  titles of books and articles.  Whilst such titles are often just simple  strings of characters, this is not always the case.  The titles of books  on mathematics may contain mathematical formulae, that could be  represented using MathML [@@REF].  Titles may include HTML markup.    For example  [@@complete namespaces etc]:      <rdf:Description>      <dc:title rdf:parseType="Literal">  <!-- @@spelling? -->        <span xml:lang="en">          The <em><br /></em> Element Considered Harmful.        </span>      </dc:title>    </rdf:Description>    describes a graph containing one triple:      _:a <dc:title> " \        <span xml:lang="en" xmlns:dc="@@"> \           The <em><br /></em> Element Considered Harmful. \        </span>"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .  # @@ needs checking    The rdf:parseType="Literal" attribute in the RDF/XML indicates that all  the XML within the <dc:title> element is an XML fragment that is the  value of the dc:title property.    The value of the property is a typed literal, whose datatype,  rdf:XMLLiteral is defined by RDF, specifically to represent fragments of  XML.  The XML fragment is canonicalized according to the XML Exclusive  Canonicalization recommendation [@@ref].  This causes declarations of  used namespaces to be added to the fragment, the escaping of reserved  characters such as '<', '>' and '&', and possibly, the re-ordering of  attributes.  Contextual attributes, such as xml:lang and xml:base are  not inherited from the RDF/XML document, and, if required, must, as  shown in the example, be explicitly specified in the XML fragment.    This example illustrates that designers should take care when designing  RDF data.  In cases where the value of a property may sometimes contain  rich text and sometimes not, the designer should either use  rdf:parseType="Literal" throughout, or design the application to handle  both plain literals and rdf:XMLLiteral's.

        One of the things that has come out of our discussions with I18N has, I  think, been that we better understand the relationship between sequences  of characters and markup.  Whilst I18N did not specifically point out  this flaw in the current syntax spec, I think it should be attributed to  their input.    Consider the test case:    <rdf:Description>    <eg:prop rdf:parseType="Literal"><em><br /></em></eg:prop>  </rdf:Description>    If my reading of the syntax document [1] is correct, it states that this  is equivalent to (with a little license in the syntax):    _:a <eg:prop> "<em><br /></em>"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .    I believe that should read    _:a <eg:prop> "<em><br /></em>^^ rdf:XMLLiteral .    or some variation on that theme, to preserve the distinction between  markup and content.  We need to decide exactly what characters get  escaped.    DaveB: is my reading of syntax correct?    Martin/I18N - would you endorse this comment?

Good point.  My take is that they are equivalent now and we are committed to   keeping them equivalent, so it would be ok to close it given that.  It would be   hard to argue its urgent to close this, I'm just trying to get some issues   closed off in parallel with working on the biggies.  How about:        o The WG believes that:           - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory         - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph         - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model           and Syntax document          are currently all equivalent and the WG is resolves to maintain that        equivalence.

The current situation where type, and  some vocabularies (reification and containers) are introduced in m&s  before schema defines the typing mechanism seems awkward.  This  paritioning groups the definition of type along with the rest of  schema.     > This starts to get into the basis of my comment at the telecon, that we  > might want to include some stuff currently in Schema in these  > descriptions.

Are you suggesting that the Abstract Syntax and Semantics [need to be  careful about that acronym] as suggested in the draft partition CANNOT  stand alone without notions of type, Class etc?      If you are suggesting that the step all the way from ASS as in the   draft partition proposal to schema is too big and to break that up  into two layers - built in typing and then user defined typing, I  wouldn't disagree with you.    I suggest there is value in identifying a base layer which is  minimal on which everything else could be built.  Right now I don't  expect that MUST include concepts of type, Class etc, but I could  be proved wrong.    Brian

Response to I18N Objection on XMLLiteral  ========================================    JJC drafted text:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0244.html    Reviewed closely by PatrickS.  EM considered it helpful.  DaveB suggests   adding that we got negative feedback on the use of a wrapper.  bwm   concerned that claims about limitations imposed by ex-c18n were   overstated.  EM stated that the chairs must be comfortable with the   rebuttal.    ACTION: bwm email comment about ex-c18N claim    ACTION: danbri to review the proposed rebuttal    Docment Status  ==============    primer - ready to go  concepts - chair beleives it is ready to go  syntax - ready to go  semantics - ready to go  schema - uptodate on technical content          - process for handling last call comments to be completed  testcases - done except for test concerning equivalence               between datatypes    The test case issue was discussed in       http://rdfweb.org/pipermail/rdfcore-in-exile/2003-August/000007.html    After discussion it was decided that no change was needed for the test   in question.    ACTION PatH check whether pfps is now satisfied on pfps-06.    (scribe note - in light of later decisions, this might be premature).    French Translation Review  =========================    Danbri asked for competent French speakers to check the French   translation of RDF Schema comments.  None forthcoming, will ask on RDF   interest.    Publication: Next Steps  =======================    EM has written a draft request to advance to CR.  However, he raised a   number of concerns about whether this was the appropriate next step:       - the WG agrees it has made substantive changes to the documents     - the Director may choose to ask that they be given a second last call     - the Director is now on holiday and progress is likely to require his       participation     - the documents could advance directly from a second last call to PR    In particular, EM referred to    http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr#last-call  http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/tr#return-to-wg    It was noted that a second last call could generate new issues, e.g.   from I18N.    bwm noted that there seemed to be some wiggle room in the process   document.  The WG could request advancement to CR despite the   substantive changes.  The director then decides whether to advance the   documents or send them back to the WG.  EM was unsure what criteria the   Director applied in making such a decision.    Arguments that could be made to support advancement include:       - the WG has done due dilligence in getting review from the developer   community    It was noted that since it has not gone through a TR process, it may not   have reached all the community, especially those who might be most   concerned about I18N issues.    BWM noted that pfps has requested a complete review the modified documents.    EM suggested the question is where to put our effort.  Is it better to   put effort into creating a case for moving forward without another last   call, or to just do another last call.    BWM noted that jjc was not present and was known to have strong views   that the next step should be CR.    EM noted that if there are unresolved issues, they can still appear at   CR or even PR, and it is better to get them in a LC.    Danbri asked if the editors had the energy for another last call:    DaveB:  yes  Frank:  yes  JanG:   yes  Danbri: yes    bwm's employer wishes him to spend less time on RDFCore.    The chairs indicated they "are minded" that the next step should be a   second last call.  The late agenda and the absence of jjc prevented a   formal decision.    ACTION: bwm contact I18N to ask whether they have other issues we \  should deal with before a second last call    ACTION: bwm send email about xmlsch-03    ACTION: em circulate a target publication date    ADJOURNED    --   swebscrape:N3:python:   http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/scripts/minutes2n3.py

I'd like to see a general policy that   proposals that change what M&S says, or the common interpretation of what it   says, are specifically highlighted.    It would be easier to just say, we are not changing the current spec, but we   already have precedent, aboutEachPrefix, that we will change something if we   feel there are very strong reasons to do so.    I haven't seen any such case made for this change.    The barrier for making changes is set very much higher than for   'clarifications'.  A strong case must be made that the change is necessary.   There must be a strong call from the community to make the change.  And we must   be sure we have evidence of how existing code and data and will be affected.   And there must be good reason why it cannot wait till we have a more relaxed   charter.    We should resist the temptation to fix things that we don't like but are not   really broken.  Lets save those for rdf 2.    Brian

Yes I agree that it can't always be done.  With an anonymous resource it  can never be done.  With a URI it can sometimes be done.  That is a   difference and it may be significant to an application.      > Second, while of course the other  > application can recognise the URI in the sense that they know where  > it comes from, there is no general presumption that they can  > 'identify' what it denotes, ie discover exactly what resource that  > was supposed to be.

If I can tell that the scope of such a URI is so limited, then I think  I might be happy with that - so long as I can tell such URI's from those  those are not so limited.    Brian        

        I have sent, at last, the datatypes message to rdf interest and rdf logic   and await the explosion.    I have modified it from the draft approved by the WG in the light of recent   discussion.  I trust the WG will approve of the modification.    At the f2f and elsewhere, concern has been raised the we might simply   repeat the discussion, in all its confusion and volume, that we have had in   RDFCore, in a wider forum.  It would be a disaster if that were to happen.    I am not sure what other WG's have done in the past, and would welcome   guidance from those who have been here before.    However, I strongly suggest that members of the WG refrain from any form of   advocacy for their preferred position on the other lists.  We are seeking   input from the community on this issue, not a debate.    I recognise that what is advocacy and what is helpful explanation is a   difficult line to draw.  I am loathe to suggest gagging people, but I also   suggest that folks leave it to me to answer for the WG on any questions or   issues that arise on the other lists.  If anyone is dissatisfied with   anything I say, then raise that with me first and we will correct it.    Brian

So manual tracking might be easier.     I'd like to reuse what I did before.  The WG are used to it.  Commentors   are used to it.  I'm used to it.

Which of   > these is called a statement?      You have put your finger on a key question, that I think we need to get clear if     we are to reconcile the language of the old M&S with the new model theory.    We are dealing here with two formal models.  M&S has a formal model, and we have   the new model theory.  I think that M&S has the concept of statement and the new   model theory does not.    My *personal* reading of M&S is that statement and triple meant two different   things.       o a statement is an abstraction; its a tuple with three components, subject,   ...       o a triple is a concrete representation of a statement, e.g. state in a   computer memory, markings on paper etc.    [I'm not defending this model; I'm just trying to express it.  It may well be   full of contradictions]    How do these concepts relate to the new model theory.  Well, a triple in   n-triples is pretty clearly still a triple.  What is an arc in a graph?  Not a   statement, I think.  If I write:       <:sky> <:is> <:blue> .     <:sky> <:is> <:blue> .    I clearly have two triples.  I would also have two arcs in one of your graphs   (until it got tidied).  But to M&S, (as I interpret it, others would disagree)   there is only one statement, because both triples denote the same statement.    I find no concept similar to statement in the new model theory.    Brian

      Art,    Thanks for this.  Its good to provide a rationale.  I suggest it would  be good practice for us to try to provide a written rationale for all  the decisions that we make.    The main difference I see between this proposal and the earlier one is  the handling of legacy.    The m&s grammar is clear; attributes such as ID, about etc are  unqualified.  Both proposals suggest that this is changed to require  qualified attributes.    If the grammar were changed as in this proposal, all strictly conforming  RDF 1.0 would not be legal RDF 1.1 (well maybe you could argue that its  legal, but it wouldn't mean the right thing).    The earlier proposal mandates that an RDF 1.1 processor will process   'correct' RDF 1.0 correctly.  This proposal leaves that decision up to  the implementor.    Do we have any good reasons for preferring one approach to the other?    Will this change impact existing data and specifications based on RDF?

The first range statement being:        ex:age rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .    which is inconsistent with:        Jenny ex:age _:1 .      _:1 xsd:integer.map "22" .    as the latter entails:        _:1 rdfs:type xsd:integer.val    and the intersection of xsd:integer.lex and xsd:integer.val is empty.

        I was discussing the vote last Friday with Eric yesterday evening and he   reminded me that W3C process is about *consensus*.    I re-read the  W3C process document       http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/groups.html#WGVotes    this morning, where I found the following:    [[  The W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all   legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them. Decisions   may be made during meetings (face-to-face or distributed) as well as   through email. The following terms are used in this document to describe   the level of support for a group decision:        1. Unanimity: All participants agree.      2. Consensus: No participants object (but some may abstain).      3. Dissent: At least one participant objects.    Where unanimity is not possible, the group should strive to make decisions   where there is at least consensus with substantial support (i.e., few   abstentions) from all participants. To avoid decisions that are made   despite nearly universal apathy (i.e., with little support and substantial   abstention), groups are encouraged to set minimum thresholds of active   support before a decision can actually be recorded. The appropriate   percentage may vary depending on the size of the group and the nature of   the decision. A group charter may include a quorum requirement for   consensus decisions.    In some cases, even after careful consideration of all points of view, a   group may find itself unable to reach consensus. When this happens, if   there is a need to advance (for example, to produce a deliverable in a   timely manner), the Chair may announce a decision to which there is   dissent. When deciding to announce such a decision, the Chair must be aware   of which participants work for the same (or related) Member organizations   and weigh their input accordingly. When a decision must be reached despite   dissent, groups should favor proposals that create the least strong   objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large   majority of the group but that cause strong objections from a few participants.  ]]    Since the vote on Friday, we have seen both Jos and Jan raise further   dissent than was apparent at the telecon.    A 6-5 vote with Jos missing and later dissenting hardly represents consensus.    I believe we have to try again to find a consensus.  I am therefore   suggesting that we put our thinking caps back on, better understand the   real concerns related to this issue and see if we can find a solution that   can attract broader support than we have seen so far.    It has been suggested that a way to approach difficult issues like this, is   to work on agreeing, not on the decision itself, but on the issues related   to the decision; on the rationale if you like, for why the decision should   be made one way rather than another.  To that end, I suggest as a start   towards doing that, I collect and summarize the input we had last week.    Brian

I'd like some input from those with previous experience about what works best.    I'm struggling from lack of experience, to figure out what principles   should apply.  The advice I heard last week was that any comment that   requires a change to the document gets reviewed by the WG.    Brian        

      I don't know if this is going to be helpful, but I thought it worth the   attempt to pull together the datatyping discussion.    I've been through todays mail traffic and pulled the issues as I've   recognised them.  In general I've ignored retoric, exposition of beliefs as   to how it *should* be done and tried to focus on issues that I can, in some   sense make concrete.  I've also tried to be even handed.  The result is no   doubt imperfect; so help me get it right, next time round.    Issue B1:  =========    In S, if one wants to use both idiom A and idiom B, e.g.       <mary> <age> "10" .     <age>  <rdfs:range> <xsd:integer.lex> .    and       <mary> <ageD> _:a .     _:a    <xsd:integer.map> "10" .    two properties have to be used, <age> and <ageD>, in this example.    I believe there is a agreement that this is a difference between the two   proposals.  Indeed, it may be said that the main aim of TDL is to avoid requiring   different properties for these different idioms.    Does anyone in the WG consider this feature of S, on its own, to be a   "can't live with" issue with S?      Issue B2: Multiple Lexical Representations of a data value  ==========================================================    S, idiom A, permits multiple lexical representations of a data value:       _:i <xsd:double>    "10.1" .     _:i <xsd:double.de> "10,1" .    I believe there is agreement that S-A allows this.    Does anyone in the WG consider this, on its own, to be a "can't live with"   issue with S?      Issue B3:  the "duh" issue  ==========================    DanC is concerened that with TDL:       <mary> <haircolor> "red" .    and a rule:       ?x <haircolor> "red" => ?x <rdf:type> <redhead> .    one cannot conclude       <mary> <rdf:type> <rdfhead> .    since one conclude that both "red"'s denote the same thing.    Jeremy has responded:    From:       <mary> <haircolor> "red" .     <haircolor> <rdfs:range> <xsd:string> .    and the same rule one can draw the required inference.    DanC:  Does that solve the problem?  Do you withdraw that objection?    Jeremy/Patrick:  Do you accept that without the range constraint, DanC is   correct?      Issue B4 - TDL breaks existing code  ===================================    This is similar to B2.  I've changed the example slightly from Sergey's.  Consider the graph:       _:f <rdf:type> <film> .     _:f <dc:Title> "10" .     <mary> <age> "10" .    Given a query:       (?x <dc:Title> ?y) & (?z <age> ?y)    existing applications will return:       ?x = _:f, ?y = "10", ?z = <mary>    Under TDL, they would return null.    Sergey:  Does this version of the issue illustrate your point?    Jeremy/Patrick:  Do you accept this analysis; would the query return null   under TDL?      Issue B5:  Storage Requirements  ===============================    TDL requires significantly more storage to implement.    Jeremy/Patrick:  do you accept this statement?      Issue B6: S requires 4 URI's be registered for each data type  =============================================================    S requires that for each datatype 4 URI's be registered       datatype     datatype.lex     datatype.val     datatype.map    Sergey:  Do you agree this is the case?  If not, how many URI's are   required to implement ALL the idioms of S and coexist in the same model.        

        I've prepared the attached as some briefing notes to help Danbri do the   update to schema.  Please feel free to correct bits that you think are   wrong or add bits that are missing.    Datatypes  =========    o Define rdfs:Datatype the class of all datatypes.  o rdfs:Datatype is a subclass of rdfs:Class, i.e. datatypes are classes  o The class extension of a datatype class is the value space of the class.  o a range constraint on a property can take a datatype as its value  o rdfs:XMLLiteral is a member of rdfs:Datatype  o rdfs:XMLLiteral is a subClass of rdf:Literal  o some discussion of notion of a datatype inconsistency - lex form does not   come from lex space or range constraints with disjoint value spaces    Collections  ===========    o Define terms rdf:List a class                  rdf:first a property                  rdf:rest a property                  rdf:nil  a resource  o rdf:rest has a range of rdf:List

I've been pointing to test cases from  the issues list document.  Are you saying that test cases under       http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/    Are not publicly readable?  I can read them, so they are presumably at  least member readable.      >   > and that any test or directory not in [1] or is different than  > the same file in [1] has NOT been approved.      So to tell whether a test is approved or not, I have to download the  zip file?  That doesn't seem very satisfactory.

I presume from the above we are considering the P option.  What the query would   actually return would be better represented as:       <#foo> <#intProperty>  _:lit:"0x12" .    You are right that there is not sufficient information here to deduce what   "0x12" means, but one could then query for the rdf:type property of _:lit:"0x12"   which would return:       _:lit:"0x12" <rdf:type> <#hexProperty> .    And that is sufficient.  Eh? :)    [...]      >   > Now, if instead we had our data defined as follows:  >   > <rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo">  >    <hexProperty rdf:resource="xxx:hexint:0x12"/>  > </rdf:Description>  >   > then the logical binding of   >   > <rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo">  >    <intProperty rdf:resource="xxx:hexint:0x12"/>  > </rdf:Description>      Yes, I see that.  Its neat, and has some nice attractions from an implementors   point of view.    So far we have this use case for the P proposal, and your proposal, lets call   that the X proposal (since P & S are already in use).  Lets go for a full house   an examine this use case with the S proposal.    We would have:      <rdfs:Class rdf:ID="integer/>      <rdfs:Property rdf:ID="hexInteger">      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:ID="repProperty"/>    </rdf:Class>      <rdf:Property rdf:ID="intProperty">       <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#integer"/>    </rdf:Property>      <rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo">       <intProperty  hexInteger="0x12"/>    </rdf:Description>    Now if we query that for the value of the intPropoperty we get:       <#foo>  <intProperty>  _:anon .    Now querying for representation properties of _:anon we get       _:anon  <#hexInteger> "0x12" .    which would seem to be sufficient.    Finally, thanks again for taking the trouble to provide a concrete example.  It   communicated so much better to me, and possibly others in the WG, what you meant.    Brian

        Fiddling about with the MT, I noticed:    The closure rule se1 is defined such that given a bnode as the object of  a triple, it will generate a similar triple with a different bnode.   When applied recursively, this will generate an infinite number of  triples.  Similarly for se2.    The current official Ed's draft of the MT      http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#ClosRules    states:    [[  2. Apply the rules se1 and se2 and the following RDF closure rules  recursively to generate all legal RDF triples (i.e. until none of the  rules apply or the graph is unchanged.) Here xxx and yyy stand for any  URIref, blank node or literal, aaa for any URIref.  ]]    Given the definitions of se1 and se2, the terminating condition can  never be met, unless the definition of 'aaa' is intended to overrides  that given in the definition of se1 and se2.  I'm confused.    I suggest that the MT adopt a uniform terminology throughout, e.g. 'aaa'  always means just a URIref throughtout, or whatever convention the  editor finds most appropriate.    What is the current position on the size of the closures generated by  these rules?  Is it the intent to make them as small as we reasonably  can?  Does it matter?  Was it the editors intention that the rules  generate this infinite set of triples?    Brian

I can't confirm that.  I've been tracking responses to commentors on the   misguided assumption that responses would go out soon after the   resolution.  A mistake to be corrected next time around.    I suppose I could refactor my records to track the actual resolutions but   I'm not sure its worth it at this stage.    Brian

What is the source   of uriref?  Maybe: just delete?    A statement with this property as predicate, states that further   information about the subject is to be found in the object resource.  Such   statements are typically used to identify an RDF schema that contains the   defining description of the subject resource.  The object resource is not   constrained to be in any specific form.

      This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon.  I   need them by noon uk time Thursday please.    My current list of possibles includes:    datatyping:  completing the round table and deciding which features (S-B,   datatyping triples and doublets) should be included in the solution.    reification: Frank?    model theory for bags: go with the "its a sequence really" approach    Any other quick kills I can identify.    semantics of fragment id's:  I'd like to make sure we have Aaron's input on   this one as he won't be at the face to face.

It seems to say that one prefer to use   xsd:string over plain literals.  Should it turn out that xsd:string and   plain literal without a lang tag denote the same thing is there a good   reason to press users to use the datatyped form with its attendant   syntactic burden?    Perhaps substitute 'may' for 'should'?    [[  >A plain literal is a string combined with an optional language   >identifier.  These may be used for representing plain text in a natural   >language.

Some examples that I can relate to would be good.  For example is the x in 5x+1=6 a free variable?  Thats what  I was calling an unknown.  Wheras the x in x+y=0 is a  variable.  At least that's the distinction I thought you  were making.     >   > and I think the misunderstanding is that  > anonymous resources are (sometimes)  > 'treated' as [1] whereas I think they  > should always be treated as [2].

I would have said _:a is an unknown.  The difference  between a free variable and an unknown is that a free variable  may be bound to many things, an unknown can bind to just one.    > I think this is wrong because there is no  > quantification: the floating thing should  > be existentially quantified    Doesn't existential quantification turn a free variable into  an unkown?  That's why skolemization works - we can give an  existentially qualified variable a name (assuming for the  moment we are not in the scope of a universal quanitifer,  because we don't have any of those in rdf).    Now if that were true, then you and I have the same model  for what what is going on here.  _:a is both an existentially  qualified variable and an 'unknown' because they are the  same thing (in this context - because we have no universal  quantification)    So if that is the case, then what's the problem here?    Maybe the problem is that you are of the view that it does no  hard to assign a name to an anonymous resource.  That's just  skolemization.  You might then argue, with Sergey, that there  is no need to represent anonymous resources in the model.  And  Jan's problem that RDF/XML cannot represent an arbritary model  is not a problem.    By the way I've changed the title from log:forSome.  This may  be another misunderstanding on my part, but I'm talking about  anon resources as they would be defined in the lowest layers  of the rdf model.  At that layer log:forSome is not defined  so we can't use it here.    If you are taling about a logic language layered on top of the  core, that could explain a lot.    > and I think  > the best way to do that is to *point*  > to it.

        Hi Patrick,    First of all, I'd like to thank for raising and exploring options that  might better meet I18N's needs.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure these have  worked out as well as we hoped.    As I understand the essence of the revised proposal, which you refer to  in your post, is to draw a clear distinction between contextual and  non-contextual literals - i.e. those that inherit XML characteristics  such lang, base etc from their environment and those which do not.    In that proposal:     - contextual literals in RDF/XML inherit their context, including not  just xml:lang but also xml:base and "etc".     - non contextual literals inherit none of their context, including  namespaces    Do we fully understand the consequences of this and how to do it?  I'm  concerned that this might not be as minor a change as you suggest.  For  example, what canonicalization spec do we refer to for canonicalization  that does not include namespaces?

I've seen it many times   before on rdf interest and elsewhere and never get anywhere.    It was for this, if for nothing else, that I wanted us to have a model theory.

I confess I did  not read the text of that paragraph, I just looked at the math and it  was not obvious to me that IP must be a subset of IR.    I then checked the now complete (?) closure rules in 7.2 and couldn't  see how to get the required entailment.

My literal objects at the  moment look a bit like:      struct {      String  string;      String  lang;      boolean wellFormed;    }    I was thinking of extending this to:      struct {      String  string;      String  lang;      boolean wellFormed;      Set     namespaces;    }    so the object that represents a literal would know what namespaces and their  prefixes are.

This,  > along with xml:lang, is missing from the M&S 1.0 model.    We need to do an analysis of what M&S actually says about this.  You were around when this was done Ron, what did the original wg  have in mind when they added parseType="literal" to the spec.  I suspect that they just wanted a convenient way of representing  markup as a string without having to to escape all those < chars.  Did the working group realise that parseType="Literal" introduced  a new kind of literal into the model.  Was that the intent?    I kinda take issue with the repeated claims that xml:lang is   'missing' from the model described in m&s.  m&s is quite clear  that the language is 'part of' the literal.  The locale is  not explicitly represented as a triple, true, but its part of  a literal which is part of the model.    >   > There are multiple APIs possible, the spec should not require  > or preclude any particular one.

      I had an action from last weeks telecon to draft an RDFS document to   replace the one at the end of the RDF namespace       http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#    I have attached such a draft.  It is a cut down version of rdfs.rdf with:       - a new comment inserted to describe the document     - the owl:ontology modified to the RDF URI     - terms in the RDFS vocabulary are removed in the sense that they are   not defined in this document    It uses only syntax defined in M&S, specifically, xml:base is not used.     Ralph considered this important, at least until we get to rec.    Differences from the document at currently at the rdf namespace URI are:       - labels are included for all terms     - the comments are consistent with those used in RDFS.rdf and the   current specs     - an Owl ontology element has been added     - the list vocabulary rdf:List, rdf:nil, rdf:first and rdf:rest has   been added     - the rdf:XMLLiteral class has been added.     - domain and ranges for rdf:value are specified for all properties     - there is an rdfs:subClassOf property for all classes     - there is an rdfs:isDefinedBy property for all terms    Brian          text/rdf attachment: rdf.rdf

        The RDFCore WG are putting the finishing touches to a proposal for using   XML Schema Datatypes in RDF graphs.  We hope to have a WD to share with   folks soon.    In doing this, the following question has arisen concerning the value   spaces of the primitive datatypes.    Are the value spaces of the primitive datatypes disjoint, i.e. are there   any cases where a value may be in more than value space.  A specific case   to consider is:       is http://example.org/ in both xsd:string and xsd:anyURI    noting that RFC 2396 states:       [[An identifier is an object that can act as a reference to            something that has identity.  In the case of URI, the object is            a sequence of characters with a restricted syntax.]]    Put another way, can we assume that if we have two values, one from the   value space of one primitive datatype, and the other from the value space   of a different primitive datatype, then they must be different values.    To the best of my knowledge, the RDFCore WG has no preferred answer to this   question.  We wish to know the answer to ensure that our specification   accurately reflects XML Schema datatypes.

      Ladies and Gentlemen,    We have just had our first face to face meeting.  Whilst I think it went  reasonably well, I'd like to start a thread for comments on what we might  try to improve next time, whilst this one is still fresh in our minds.    Brian

I'm not sure that data uri's are in fact isomorphic with literals as  defined in m&s.  Consider:    <rdf:Description>    <foo:bar xml:lang="en">weekend</foo:bar>    <foo:bar xml:lang="fr">weekend</foo:bar>  </rdf:Description>    With literals this would be:      _:a <foo:bar> "weekend"-"en" .   (I've invented this syntax for lang attrs)    _:a <foo:bar> "weekend"-"fr" .    with data uri's it would be:      _:a <foo:bar> <data:text/plain;weekend> .    <data:text/plain;weekend> <xml:lang> <data:text/plain;en> .    <data:text/plain;weekend> <xml:lang> <data:text/plain;fr> .

      I've been drafting a schedule to see if our target of last call at the   beginning of May is attainable.  This is the worst sort of schedule; I   started at the end and worked back - so this is not an estimate; its a "do   we think we can do this"?

        The RDFCore WG has reviewed the Owl Reference last call WD at       http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-ref-20030331/    RDFCore congratulates the WEBONT WG and particularly the authors and   editors of the reference document for its quality and clarity.    For the convenience of WEBONT we have given an ID to each   comment.  Comments not specific to RDFCore's interests will be sent   separately by the reviewer.    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-owl-rdf-semantics    We particularly admire the clarity of this note in 8.1 and request that a   similarly worded sentence be added to 1.2 para 2 and that the note in 1.4   be phrased in the same or similar manner.    [[  NOTE: RDF documents will generally be in OWL Full, unless they are   specifically constructed to be in OWL DL or Lite.  ]]    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-owl-class-denotation    It has been suggested to RDFCore that owl:Class is not needed.  RDFCore   requests the creation of test cases to clearly illustrate the differences   between owl:Class and rdfs:Class.    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-what-is-a-class-description      [[  3.1 Class descriptions    A class description is the term used in this document (and in the OWL   Semantics and Abstract Syntax) for the basic building blocks of class   axioms (informally called class definitions in the Overview and Guide   documents). OWL distinguishes six types of class descriptions:        1. a class identifier (a URI reference)      2. an exhaustive enumeration of individuals that together form the   instances of a class      3. a property restriction      4. the intersection of two or more class descriptions      5. the union of two or more class descriptions      6. the complement of a class description  ]]    Its not clear from the text what a class description is.  We take it to be   an RDF Graph (a set of triples) describing a class.  The above seems to say:       a class identifier (a URI reference) is a type of RDF graph    which doesn't make sense.  Similarly, the meaning of       the compliment of an RDF graph    isn't clear.    Whilst this is just wordsmithing, the concept of a class description is of   prime importance to the rest of the spec and should be clear.    Further:    [[  NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of the type   2-6, this has the extra effect of providing a way of referring to the class   description by its name, i.e., as a class description of type 1. See   Section 3.2.3 for details.  ]]    Does this name identify the class description, or the class described by   the description?  We suspect the latter, in which case:    [[  NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of the type   2-6, this has the extra effect of providing a way of referring to the class   so described by its name. See Section 3.2.3 for details.  ]]    There are other instances of this confusion: e.g. in 3.1.2    [[  A value constraint puts constraints on the value range of the property when   applied to this particular class description.  ]]    The constraint is on the property when applied to an instance of the class   described by this particular class description.    In 3.2    [[  * rdfs:subClassOf allows one to say that the class extension of a class   description is a subset of the class extension of another class description.  ]]    and 3.2.1    [[  A class description is by definition a subclass of itself.  ]]    which seems to confuse the notion of class and class description.    ------------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-use-ntriples    [[  "Human rdf:type owl:Class .".  ]]    In the interests of inter-spec consistency we request that WEBONT docs use   the same abbreviated form of n-triples as the RDF docs, which would make   the above    [[  "base:Human rdf:type owl:class ."  ]]  with some appropriate explanation of what base is.    -------------------------      #owlref-rdfcore-domain-range-value terminology    Throught the documents various terms, such as "value range", "range value",   "range", "domain", "domain value" are use to talk about the values of   properties.  Several of these terms are undefined, they often are used   inconsistently and there seems to be unnecessary duplication in the use of   the terms.    The term "value range" is used in the document and is not defined.  We   suggest the meaning of this term be clearly defined if it is to be   used.  However, it seems to mean the same thing as the term 'range' defined   in RDFS, so the definition of a new term may be redundant.    Confusingly, the term "range value" is also used in the document and is not   defined.  We suggest the meaning of this term be clearly defined if it is   to be used.  However, it seems to mean the same thing as the term 'value'   as used in RDFS, so the definition of a new term may be redundant.    We also note that it is used inconsistently.    In 3.1.2    [[  Property restrictions can be applied both to datatype properties   (properties for which the range value is a data literal) and object   properties (properties for which the range value is an individual).  ]]    it appears to be used to refer to thing denoted by the object of a triple.    In 3.1.2.1 it is used to state a syntactic constraint on OWL Lite documents.    [[  NOTE: In OWL Lite the range value of owl:allValuesFrom must be a class   identifier.  ]]    Here it refers to the object of the triple, not the thing the object denotes.    And further that the term 'value' seems to suffice elsewhere, e.g. 3.1.2.1:    [[  To see why this is so, observe that the owl:allValuesFrom constraint   demands that all values of P belong to class P, and if no such values   exist, the constraint is trivially true.  ]]      4.2    [[  Syntactically, owl:equivalentProperty is a property with as both domain and   range an instance of rdf:Property.  ]]    The domain of a property is a class, as is the range.  And domain and range   aren't about syntax (occurs elsewhere also).  Suggest:    [[  owl:equivalentProperty is a property.  Its rdfs:domain is rdf:Property, as   is its rdfs:range.  ]]    or less formally    [[  owl:equivalentProperty is a property is a property that relates two properties.  ]]    In owl:backwardCompatibleWith    [[  The owl:backwardCompatibleWith construct is a property with an instance of   the class owl:Ontology as its domain and range.  ]]    This is further confusion over the use of the terms domain and   range.  Domains and Ranges of properties are classes, not instances.  Nor   is the construct a property!    [[  owl:backwardCompatibleWith is a property.  Its domain is owl:Ontology as is   its range.  ]]    We request:       o A global check throughout the document of all uses of all terms   involving the words 'domain' and  'range'       o that wherever possible the terminology used in the RDFCore specs be   adopted       o where RDFCore does not provide appropriate terminology, that any new   terms be defined and used consistently       o RDFCore would be willing to help discuss appropriate terminology    -----------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-value-space    In 3.1.2.2    [[  The cardinality constraint owl:maxCardinality is a built-in OWL property   that links a restriction class to a data value belonging to the range of   the XML Schema datatype nonNegativeInteger.  ]]    We believe the correct term is "the value space of the XML Schema datatype   nonNegativeInteger".    Similarly in minCardinality.    -------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-individual-identity    5.2 Individual Identity    This section should include some words about URIREF comparison, probably   with a reference to rdf concepts where we say how URIREFS are compared.       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Graph-URIref    ---------------------------------  #owlref-rdfcore-datatypes-attributes-have-not    6.1 Datatypes    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype ...  ]]    Its not the literal that has an XML attribute - that is the way it is   written in rdf/xml.    Suggest:    [[  In RDF/XML, the type of a literal is specified by an "rdf:datatype" attribute.  ]]    Similarly:    [[  When using datatypes, please note that even if the range of a property is   declared to be of a certain datatype, RDF still requires a rdf:datatype   attribute in a statement about this property, otherwise it is treated as a   plain literal.  ]]    Suggest:    [[  When using datatypes, please note that even if a property is defined to   have a range of a certain datatype, RDF/XML still requires that the   datatype be specified each time the property is used.  ]]    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-rdfs:literal-not-a-datatype    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype of which the   value is recommended to be one of the following:  ...    # The RDF datatype rdfs:Literal  which is the class of literals, typed and   plain.  ]]    rdfs:Literal is not a datatype.    ----------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-qnames-in-rdfxml    In 6.2 we see:    [[              <rdf:first rdf:datatype="xsd:integer">0</rdf:first>  ]]    A qname is not allowed as the value of an rdf:datatype property.  This   should be:    [[              <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">0</rdf:first>  ]]    ---------------------------------      #owlref-rdfcore-enumerated-datatype-in-xml    6.2 Enumerated datatype    We suggest the following form for writing the syntax of lists with literal   values, which we believe is more slightly more readable and better suited   to longer lists.    [[  <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID="tennisGameScore">     <rdfs:range>       <owl:DataRange>         <owl:oneOf>             <rdf:List>             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">0</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:nodeID="l2"/>           </rdf:List>             <rdf:List rdf:nodeID="l2">             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">15</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:nodeID="l3"/>           </rdf:List>             <rdf:List rdf:nodeID="l3">             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">30</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:nodeID="l4"/>           </rdf:List>             <rdf:List rdf:nodeID="l4">             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">30</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:resource="&rdf;nil"/>           </rdf:List>           </owl:oneOf>       </owl:DataRange>     </rdfs:range>  </owl:DatatypeProperty>  ]]    ---------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-annotation-restriction    7.1 Annotations    [[       * Annotation properties must not be used in property axioms (e.g., no   subproperties are allowed).  ]]    We believe there may be an editorial error here, and that this restriction   is not intended to apply to OWL Full.    As stated, since rdfs:domain and rdfs:range are property axioms, this means   that we can't define a domain and range for an annotation property in   Owl.  Further rdfs defines rdfs:isDefinedBy to be a subproperty of   rdfs:seeAlso.  That would mean that not all RDF graphs are legal OWL Full,   and that in fact the graph for RDF Schema is not legal OWL Full.    ------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-class-ontology    RDFCore makes this point with some trepidation, not wishing to cause WEBONT   to waste time and energy on a discussion with little practical impact.    In 7.2    [[  An ontology header component is represented with an instance of the class   owl:Ontology, which typically identifies the containing document with a   same-document reference [section 4.2 of RFC2396], and which may optionally   contain, in any order, any number of import and/or versioning statements.  ]]    This seems to say that instances of the class owl:Ontology are   documents.  RDFCore suggests that the text be modified to be less   specific.  There are also potential difficulties with the reference to RFC   2396; it would be better to refer to the RDF specs and let them take the   heat on any 'interpretation' of RFC 2396.    We suggest:    [[  A document describing an ontology typically contains information about the   ontology itself.  An ontology is a resource, so may be described using   properties from the OWL and other namespaces, e.g.    <owl:Ontology rdf:about="">     <owl:versionInfo> ... </owl:versionInfo>     <rdfs:comment>...</rdfs:comment>     <owl:imports rdf:resource='...'/>  </owl:Ontology>    This is commonly called the ontology header and is typically found near the   beginning of the RDF/XML document.  The line       <owl:Ontology rdf:about="">    states that this block describes the current ontology.  More precisely, it   states the current base URI identifies an instance of the class   owl:Ontology.  As noted earlier, it is recommended that the base URI be   defined using an xml:base attribute in the <rdf:RDF> element at the   beginning of the document.  ]]  ----------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-transitive-datatype-properties    In 8.1    [[  Although from the semantics point of view it is not forbidden in OWL Full   to declare datatype properties to be inverse, transitive, or symmetric, in   practice this does not make much sense. (RDF does not allow data values as   the subject of a statement).  ]]    Consider:    eg:lessThan rdf:type   owl:TransitiveProperty .  eg:lessThan rdf:type   owl:DatatypeProperty .  eg:size     rdf:type   owl:DatatypeProperty .  eg:size     rdfs:range xsd:decimal .      _:a eg:size _:sa .  _:b eg:size _:sb .  _:c eg:size _:sc .    _:sa eg:lessThan _:sb .  _:sb eg:lessThan _:sc .    entails    _:sa eg:lessThan _:sc .    This is potentially useful and does make sense.    -----------------------------

      Hi Dave,    Excellent work.  I've only a few comments:    Status section, near end             Comments on this document are invited and should be sent to the           public mailing list www-rdf-comments@w3.org or to the RDF Core           Working Group.    suggest delete 'or to the RDF Core Working Group'  - rdf-comments is   the right channel.    Section 1 para 2             The RDF Core Working Group was chartered to revise RDF in light           of this implementor feedback, addressing these issues, making           decisions on ambiguous cases, changes where necessary, and to           record these as potential errata for the original document. These           changes have to be checked with the developer community as to           their affect on existing implementations and documents.    Lets stick closer to the actual wording in the charter, e.g.       The RDFCore WG is chartered to respond to the need for a number of    fixes, clarifications and improvements to the specification of RDF's    abstract model and XML syntax.  The WG wishes feedback from the    developer community of the effects of its proposals on existing    implementations and documents.    4.1, table rows 2&3    element([prop1]=value1, [prop1]=value2, ...)                           ^^^^^    prop2?    4.8    Sorry, don't know my infoset well enough.  Does defining an attibute  to take a value of type ID have a similar effect as DTD ID's?  e.g.  only one per element.  Does it have implications for what the ID  denotes e.g. something in this document.    4.12    Grammar is ambiguous since both productions match a typeAttr.  Statement  somewhere (4.1?) that if a production matches an 'any' or something more  specific, the more specific production applies.  Also affects 4.4 and 4.5.    Appendix A    Does this document reference n-triples, schema primer, schema datatypes?       Nits:  Ignorable.    Section 1 para 1             RDF Model & Syntax used an EBNF form plus explanatory text to           define and explain the XML syntax.     change to 'explain the RDF/XML syntax'.    Section 1 para 4    spelling 'resulting'    Section 1 para 4    'in terms of XML characters'.  delete XML.    Section 3 para 1    delete 'that endorse the changes from the issues list.'

And if so, what does the requirement in the  > first paragraph even mean?    As I understand things, in XML the order of elements in a document is  significant, i.e.      <foo:bar>1</foo:bar>    <foo:bar>2</foo:bar>    is not the same document as:      <foo:bar>2</foo:bar>    <foo:bar>1</foo:bar>    So really the proposal is saying that the rdf:li's are processed in  document order.    Note that this is not true for attributes on elements.  Thus      <foo:bar rdf:_1="1" rdf:_2="2"/>    is the 'same' document as:      <foo:bar rdf:_2="2" rdf:_1="1"/>    and that is the reason for the second problem I acknowedged in       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0122.html    The first paragraph is basically acknowledging that the proposal as  given is written in procedural terms, and that it should be re-written  in a declarative style.    >   > If 'encountered' has some more technical meaning in this context  > which makes it clear from the syntax what order the encountering has  > to happen, then it might be better to state the ordering in those  > terms (?)    Yes.  I agree.  Now if I could just get an hour or two ...    Brian

OK.  Can we also take a look at:       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdf-containers-syntax-ambiguity    http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-reification-required    http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-empty-property-elements    http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/Overview.html#rdfms-resource-semantics    the last of which is a step towards a more formal core model.

I didn't read the para you quote.   I just checked the maths of the semantic conditions and they didn't seem  to require that properties are resources.  I then checked the (now  complete?) closure rules in 7.2 and couldn't see how the desired  entailment could be attained from them either.

I'd much prefer to be  assured that I'm wrong.  In RDF, properties are resources, and if the  semantics ain't saying that, I do think that's a problem.    Brian        

        Jeremy,    For clarity, I think the "current approach" refers to the one in the  current ed's working drafts per previous WG decisions.  Is that what is  overcoming you with pain?

        Pat,    I'm wondering whether we should hold off your following up pfps on   pfps-06 as:       1) the xml schema lex 2 val mapping may be about to change     2) if we are doing a second last call, it may be moot    Brian

Once you have agreed what is required, you can suggest to the   chair that the changes are editorial.  I'd suggest you encourage Herman   to respond as soon as he is able.    Brian

      Issue       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-assertion    Summary: RDF is not just a data model. The RDF specs should define a semantics   so that an RDF statement on the web is interpreted as an assertion of that   statement such that its author would be responsible in law as if it had been   published in, say, a newspaper.    Propose that the RDF model theory defines a semantics for RDF and that this   issue be closed.    Brian

      I've placed a preliminary agenda for the F2F at:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020225-f2f/    I suggest for objectives we focus on:       1)  Clearing all the outstanding M&S issues       2)  Planning for last call through to Rec    Last time, we had volunteers to do short (15min) presentations on stuff of   interest.  These were I think interesting and helped to provide a pleasant   break from discussing issues all the time.  So I'd like to do the same   thing again.  I'm looking for volunteers; the deal is:       o we'll fit them in depending on how the schedule is going and how       folks are feeling       o there's no guarantee you will be called, so don't do any preparation    Let me know if you'd be up for it, and a hint about the topic.    As always, suggestions and comments on the agenda are welcome.    Brian

Good example.  You can't say that (2) was signed by A because that is  not the statement A sent.    And the question for me is do we prefer an abstract syntax  that allows us to express what A sent to us, or are we happy to loose  information in the process of transforming RDF/XML to the abstract syntax.    >   > When I sign a cheque, it is a piece of paper that I sign.

The  intent was to try to draw attention to the issue of whether the received  model is the same information as the sent one.  I think we've agreed  that if the receiver skolemizes, then the information is not the same.    Consider running the scenario twice and the second time the anon resource  gets skolemized to skolem:54321.  Given       (3) skolem:54321 hasProperty Y .    do (2) and (3) represent the same information.  If the answer is yes,  then you must be treating skolem URI's differently from say URL's.  If  the answer is no, they can't both represent the same information as in (1).    Brian

        I've begun my review of the owl reference document.  An aspect about which   I have an uncertain feeling of unease concerns the denotation of   owl:Class.  I would appreciate some guidance from the WG.    Owl introduces a notion of owl:Class, distinct from rdfs:Class with the   following rationale:    [[  NOTE: owl:Class is defined as a subclass of rdfs:Class. The rationale for   having a separate OWL class construct lies in the restrictions on OWL DL   (and thus also on OWL Lite), which imply that not all RDFS classes are   legal OWL DL classes. In OWL Full these restrictions do not exist and   therefore owl:Class and rdfs:Class are the same there.  ]]       http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/    What is bothering me is that the denotation of owl:Class seems to depend on   what is processing it, and I guess I'm making the naive user assumption,   that owl:Class denotes the same thing (horribly deep philosophical rathole   opens in front of me) wherever its used i.e. either       rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf owl:Class .    is true in the 'real world' or its not.  If its true, then why is owl:Class   needed?  If its false, why is OWL FULL asserting its true.    So I guess the naive user assumption is wrong, or maybe I'm interpreting it   naively.  Perhaps owl:Class denotes the "principle class type of the   processor that is processing this document".  That seems pretty scary too.    I guess I should assume that I'm out of my depth here.  Can someone please   explain in short simple words what owl:Class denotes and why its needed.    Brian

        Dave,    Thank you for responding.    [...]    Two points should be made:       o    The descriptions of the relations on the value spaces of Schema          datatypes are normative for schema processing but are advisory          for other applications.    I'm not really asking about *processing*.  Schema defines the value  spaces of its primitive datatypes to be sets.  We need to know what are  in those sets.    I guess there is another way to ask the question.  Given:      S = the value space of xsd:string    U = the value space of xsd:anyURI    L = the set of RDF plain literals that have no lang tag, i.e.the set  of sequences of UNICODE characters    Is S intersection U empty?  Is S intersection L empty?    Brian    [1]  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-Graph-Literal

In the post-LC editor's drafts this discussion   on recommended datatypes has been moved from OWL S&AS to the RDF   Semantics document.    We suggest the OWL Reference document simply lists the recommended   datatypes and points for further details to the relevant section of the   RDF Semantics document.    The link to RDF Semantics currently is:    http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_append.html#dtype_interp    but this will be updated at some appropriate later point in time.

        xmlsch-02 is about whitespace processing of datatypes.  We previously   decided that since " 1 "  is not in the lexical space of xsd:decimal,   " 1 "^^xsd:decimal does not denote a literal and created some test cases   to illustrate this.    It turns out the many implementations are failing these test cases.   Some use the Xerces xsd implementation which happily translates " 1 " to     1.  Before he went on vacation jjc indicated to me that maybe we   should think again about this one.    Does anyone know enough about whitespace processing in xml schema   datatypes to suggest an alternative way to handle this.  I don't know   enough, so am not qualified.    Brian

On the subject of pruning, I would encourage you to do so, in general.  I   was thinking the semantics doc was getting a bit discursive in   places.  Where there is discursive text in the semantics doc, and the topic   is covered in the primer and the semantics doc can do its job without it,   then I'd encourage elimination of the duplication.    Brian         

        My reading of schema datatypes is that with a union type:       o a lexical form can be ambiguous - i.e. might map to different values   depending on which component type is used to do the mapping       o the component types of a union are ordered by the order they are   declared when defining the union       o by default the ambiguity is resolved by applying the first type whose   lex space includes the literal       o the default can be overridden by using an xsi:type attribute    In RDF we always use the default disambiguation rule.  If you want to   override, use a more specific datatype in the rdf:datatype attribute.    I guess I'm missing something.

        Thinking in the bath about this issue and what might be bothering DanC with   the proposal we thought we agreed on Friday.  I came up with the following   test case, which may or may not reflect what he had in mind:    Does:      <a> <b> "chat"<xsd:string>-"en" .    datatype entail:      <a> <b> "chat"<xsd:string>-"fr" .    In the case where the literal denotes just the string "chat", then they   do.  In the case where it denotes a pair, then they do not.    I personally find it hard to reconcile the datatype entailment:       <a> <b> "foo"<dt1>  entails     <a> <b> "bar"<dt2>    whenever dt1.value("foo") = dt2.value("bar")    with the notion that datatype literals have lang codes.  The datatype   entailment follows from the intuition that datatype literals denote a value   from from the value space of a literal.  For values to have lang codes,   that the French integer "10" is different to the English integer "10" seems   to me likely to cause considerable user confusion.    Thus if the datatype entailment holds, then it seems that the entailment I   started with:      <a> <b> "chat"<xsd:string>-"en" .  datatype entail:    <a> <b> "chat"<xsd:string>-"fr" .    must also hold and I wonder if this rather undermines Patrick's intent.  At   the very least I suggest it will lead to both user confusion and   interoperability problems.    Jeremy has the task of resolving this issue.  I am drawing his attention to   these "bath thoughts" and copying the list so that folks can comment on the   analysis.    Brian

Do they have to be.  It seems to me as though classic literals are behaving   like 3 or 4 distrinct types:      1 basic literal    2 xml literal    3 basic literal with lang    4 xml literal with lang    I'm wondering whether 4 folds into 2 because of canonicalization; i.e. the   lang really does become part of the literal string?    Could we rationalize by giving explicit types to the old style literals:      1. a basic literal is of type xsd:string.    2. an xml literal is of type rdf:xmlstring.    3. a basic literal with a lang is of type rdf:langString    4. ... if the answer to question above is no add rdf:xmlLangString      <a> <b> "foo" .    is syntactic shorthand for      <a> <b> xsd:string"foo" .

        I would like to ask the WG to join me in expressing our thanks for the   monumental efforts that Pat Hayes, Sergey Melnick and Patrick Stickler have   put into the work on datatypes for RDF. The work on datatypes began nearly   a year ago.  I don't have the tools to determine how many email messages or   how many document drafts there have been on the subject, but the answer is   "a lot".  Hmmm, that looks like a lexical form of ... oh never mind that   for now.    Many others have also contributed to the solution of this problem, but I   felt that we should specifically acknowledge the contributions of the   editors of the WD that is now, not to be.    What matters, is that they have led us to, what I believe, is an excellent   solution and have accepted with exceptional grace that that solution is not   best described in a separate document.    I have an action from the last telecon to ensure that these gentlemen   receive appropriate acknowledgement for their efforts.  After consulting   with Eric, I understand that the mechanism for acknowledging specific   contributions to a specification, is to include an appropriate paragraph in   the acknowledgements section of affected documents.    I suggest a paragraph similar to the following (better words welcome) be   included in the primer, syntax, concepts, schema and model theory documents.    [[    The method described in the RDF family of specifications for representing   datatype values such integers and  dates, was developed under the   leadership of Pat Hayes, Sergey Melnik and Patrick Stickler.    ]]    Brian        

      There seems to be some divergence of view on this.  Lets make it an issue.    Does the model theory take a position on prince arcs?

      Jan, I've added the actual resolutions on a couple of the issues into the   minutes, for precision and completenes.

(no objections / no abstentions)    As I recall the resolution approved was the one in the  agenda viz:    The WG resolves to not change the algorithm for mapping qnames to uris and   close this issue on the grounds:       1. Such a change would be a major change to the mapping of  RDF/XML syntax to the model and would be beyond our charter.       2. It would cause the same RDF/XML to generate a different  graph from existing versus revised implementations       3. Existing code may generate wrong (illegal) graphs for some RDF/XML.        >Item 13: Issue: #rdfms-reification-required  >    Resolved: a parser is not required to create bags of reified  >         statements for all rdf:Description elements, only those which are  >         explicitly reified using an rdf:ID on a propertyElt or by an  >         RDF:bagID on the rdf:Description.  >    RESOLVED.

(no objections / no abstentions)    The resolution that was approved is:    The WG:    o resolves to not change the name of this property at this time on  the grounds:  - insufficient reasons to make this change  - will cause existing uses to be illegal - such as examples in m&s    o resolves to recast this issue as a need to clarify the semantics  of rdf:value.

        I'm getting the impression that publishing process is a bit fraught and   error prone e.g. getting the right links to the right docs in TR space.  Am   I right?  Any suggestions for how to make it easier on ourselves?    Brian

There was a long thread a while ago on rdf interest arguing that M&S could be   interpreted so that reification really represented "statings" not statements.   Suggestive that the community might by it.    Pat keeps saying that the M&S version of reification is broken.  It would be   great if he could spell out in bozon terms (i.e. so I can understand) why.    It seems to me that I want to say:       I believe the sky is blue    in which case I'm asserting my attitude towards the abstract sentence -the sky   is blue-.    I also want to be able to say       the sky is green is stated in http://example on 1st April 2013.     the sky is green is stated in http://anotherExample on 2nd April 2013.    Don't we need both concepts?    Brian

        Hi Patrick,    Thank you for this proposal.    Whatever decision we take, tidy, untidy or "we ain't sayin", we will need   to write up a rationale for why that is the best decision in the   circumstances.  I think we agreed Friday that we would write up the   rationale and then make a decision.  I would like to continue with that   plan.  In saying that, I don't consider this to be an open ended   process.  We do need to get done, and soon.    I will be proposing a detailed process in the next couple of days.  What I   currently have in mind is to discuss this issue at the next two   teleconferences and then have a vote.    I think that gives us one more chance to review the arguments and come to   greater consensus.  It also gives us one more chance to find a new way of   looking at the problem which leads to a new proposal(I know there is one   out there) that might attract stronger consensus.    So I urge the WG not to think just in terms of tidy versus untidy, but in   terms of what it is we really need and whether there might be a third   way.  I note Pat has trying.    With regard to your proposal, my immediate concern is the effect on   interoperability.  To help us make a decision, can you do an analysis for   us on the effect this proposal would have on interoperability.

This is how the use case came to me and I just passed it  straight on.  I should have included a translation.  Here is one now:    #advert123 :role "buyer";              :description [:product :roses;                            :quantity [:units :kg; :minValue "100"]].    translates to:    <#advert123> <foo:role>        "buyer" .  <#advert123> <foo:description> _:service .  _:service    <foo:product>     <foo:roses> .  _:service    <foo:quantity>    _:q .  _:q          <foo:units>       <foo:kg> .  _:q          <foo:minValue>    "100" .    i.e this is advert placed by a purchaser who wishes to buy roses in  minimum quantities of 100.    and    #advert456 :role "seller";              :description [:product :roses;                            :quantity [:units :kg; :maxValue "500"]].    translates to:    <#advert456> <foo:role>        "seller" .  <#advert123> <foo:description> _:service .  _:service    <foo:produce>     <foo:roses> .  _:service    <foo:quantity>    _:q .  _:q          <foo:units>       <foo:kg> .  _:q          <foo:maxValue>    "500" .    i.e. this is an advert placed by a seller who can sell roses in  quantities upto 500.

Err, I'm not sure why this is being raised in the context of this use  case.  I see no queries in this use case.

I'm not following the point you are trying to make here, but the  thought in my head is that we need to take care to distinguish  between the name of a 'variable' and the name of the thing  the variable is bound to.

        Hi Folks,    I printed out the new WD's today and sat down to take a look at them.  I   was encouraged by what I found.    Over the last few days there has been a lot of discussion and quite a   worrying amount of cross document issues.  I think our goal now, has to be   to stabilize these as far as we can and as quickly as we can, so that the   editors can concentrate on their on docs, free from outside disturbance.    I'd like to propose a small number of transfers between docs and invite   folks to suggest others they feel would be appropriate.    Concepts:       o 1.2 => primer     o 2.1 => primer     o 2.2 => primer    Syntax:       o section 2 => primer    Brian                 

        The two other docs that have such an introductory sentence both use the   term language, not framework.

      Hi folks,    Usual weekly call for agenda items, by noon uk time Thursday please.    I'm currently expecting to have:       - approve publication of the new mt draft     - primer update     - data types     - reification    on the agenda    Brian

      Thanks for the pointer bill, I hadn't forgotten.    Since we aren't reviewing the whole actions list each week, I thought I'd ask   Jema to send out a list of outstanding actions as they stand in terms of   approval at the end of the teleconference.    It would be easy to ask her to note those that she thinks are done at the time.

Thats not what it says - it says analysing the *structure* of the   specification.  You can know something of the structure without having   the specification itself.    However, I am sympathetic to jj'c point that the wording of this   checkpoint suggests (strictly it uses 'and' rather than 'by') it is   defining a method and that may be inappropriate.    Perhaps Karl could clarify whether this checkpoint is intended to:       - contrain the process by which a testing approach is defined    or       - require that a testing approach is defined, but not constrain the   means by which it is defined    I think jjc's understanding to be that it does the former and he objects   to that.    I'm not clear what Karl's viewpoint is.  It might be his view that the   requirement on method is vacuous and can be met trivially, in which case   it could simply be dropped.    I wonder if the positions could be reconciled with wording like:      [[  Checkpoint 1.3. The testing approach to be used is documented.    NOTE:  A single uniform testing approach may not be appropriate for all   aspects of a specification.  The testing approach may define different   approaches for different aspects, for example, different approaches may   be used for testing document syntax and for testing document processing.     The structure of a specification may give useful clues to the   different kinds of tests that would be useful.  [Priority 1]  ]]    This phrases the checkpoint as a condition that is either met or not,   which seems appropriate given my notion of the meaning of 'checkpoint'.     The note is intended to convey helpful guidance to the reader.    > That might not be what the QAWG intends but that is what the current WD   > and editors draft both say.  >   > Neither RDF Core nor WebOnt did this.    Is there an argument that this is in fact exactly what RDFCore did?  We   observed that our specs were structured into syntax and semantics and we   defined a testing approach for syntactic tests and for entailment tests.    Brian

Just when you think you've got an independent issue in RDF,   something else will slide a tentacle through a gap somewhere and link to   it.

I have had another attempt at stating a rationale for the current design  based in what Patrick, Pat, Jeremy et al have written recently, and some  thoughts of my own.  I'm just trying to capture RDFCore thinking in one  place, so as usual, please correct, amend, clarify etc.    1. For RDF, its abstract syntax, i.e. the graph, is it primary  representation.  RDF/XML is a concrete syntax for representing graphs,  i.e. from an RDF perspective, the goal is to figure out how best to  represent graphs in RDF/XML, not how to represent RDF/XML in graphs.    The typical use case for XML Literals is where an XML literal will be  written into the middle of an XML document by an application.  This is  simplest if the xml literal is a standalone fragment that can be simply  written into the XML document.    2. RDFCore agrees with feedback that it received, that  building an XML specific mechanism into its core model is architecturaly  inappropriate - it mixes things that should be independent.  Accepting  this implies that parseType="Literal" values must use one of the  existing mechanisms - i.e. either plain literals or typed literals, or a  new more general mechanism must be invented, e.g. a new triple  structure.  An XML specific mechanism is undesirable.    3. For the common use case, where applications embed a literal in an XML  document, it is preferable to distinguish,in the graph, between plain  and XML literals, so that e.g. different escaping conventions can be  applied.    4. Taking the datatype approach creates the opportunity for future applications  to subclass the datatype XMLLiteral, so that the value of a property may be   restricted to a specific form of XML Literal, possibly specified using XML   Schema.      5. The equality rules are different for plain and XML literals.      "<eg:prop eg:a='a' eg:b='b'/>" and "<eg:prop eg:b='b' eg:a='a'/>"    are different plain literals, but equal XML literals.    6. The notion that the literal in the RDF/XML fragment below     <eg:prop xml:lang="en" rdf:parseType="Literal">     <span xml:lang="fr">chat</span>   </eg:prop>    contains the English string "chat" as a substring seems bizarre.    2, 3, 4, 5  and 6 argue for using the datatyping mechanism to represent  xml literals.    7. The XSD datatyping model does not support the notion that the value  of a literal is affected by a language tag.  RDFCore's attempts to  introduce this notion caused considerable complexity and difficulty in  the model theory and met with strong negative feedback.    Thus, if language is to affect the value of an xml literal it must be  part of the members of the lexical space of the datatype.      This can be accomplished by the parser generating a wrapper element to  hold the lang tag.    8. The generation of a wrapper element is undesirable for the following  reasons:     - it is unhelpful in a primary use case where one wants to simply embed  the literal in another XML document - the application has to get rid of  the wrapper element, and find another enclosing element on which to hang  the lang tag.     - implementation complexity in general, caused by introducing and  removing the wrapper element     - the value of a property cannot be an arbritary XML fragment - it must  always have an outer wrapper     - the user may be surprised that the XML fragment is not identical to  the one represented in the RDF/XML, e.g. XPATH expressions won't work as  expected.    Thus we are left with the current RDFCore proposal.    The practical experience of WG members suggests that thinking of  parseType="Literal" values as isolated fragments of XML that do not  inherit language from their context, i.e. the current RDFCore design, is  appropriate in practice.    It has also been suggested that it is easier to integrate data from  different sources when xml lang is not inherited from context.  I am  finding that one hard to follow, unless the integration is being done  cut and paste by hand, since it is easy to always put an xml:lang=""  next to every rdf:parseType="Literal" to ensure language isolation.   Perhaps someone can provide an example to show the advantage.    Martin:     - leaving aside whether you agree with the value judgements it makes,  would you accept that the above represents close to a coherent rationale  for the current RDFCore proposal?     - do you find it at all persuasive?

An alternative would be to define a new syntax that is describable with a   DTD or an XML Schema but doing so is beyond the scope of RDFCore's current   charter.  We note that the XHTML WG have expressed interest in working on   such a syntax and have been encouraged to do so by RDFCore.  RDFCore also   welcomes XML Schema's offer to help with this work.

Clarifying the comment is part of the process and should   go on rdf comments so that we actually have a clarified comment   there.  Hopefully that will take 0-2 exchanges of messages - what I'm keen   to avoid are big sprawling discussion threads that will make it hard to   track what's happening.

        The RDFCore WG has me to forward the comments below on their behalf.  Other   comments, on behalf of RDFCore will be sent in separate messages.    Brian    ------------------------------    owlsas-rdfcore-np-complete    RDFCore notes the a consequence of the rules for owl:equivalentClass is  that distinguishing OWL DL from OWL Full has complexity NP complete and  suggests WEBONT investigate whether this complexity can be reduced.    We note from the RDF semantics document    [[  Specifications of such syntactically restricted semantic extensions MUST   include a specification of their syntactic conditions which are sufficient   to enable software to distinguish unambiguously those RDF graphs to which   the extended semantic conditions apply.  ]]     http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/    -------------------------------    owlsas-rdfcore-bnodes-restrictions    RDFCore are concerned that restrictions placed on b-nodes will limit the  applicability of OWL DL to an unnecessarily restricted subset of RDF  instance data, for which no such restrictions apply.    For example, consider the use case in:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0109.html    [[  If bNodes can only be used as the object of a single triple, they lose most  of their value as a construct in the language. As does rdf:nodeID for that  matter.    <Image>    <depicts>     <Person>       <mbox rdf:resource="mailto:danbri@w3.org"/>     </Person>  </Image>    <Group>    <member>     <Person>      <homepage rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/People/DanBri/"/>     </Person>    </member>  </Group>    ...is OK in OWL, but if we add in an rdf:nodeID on the two Person elements  to express that they serialize descriptions of the same (un-named) resource,  we're in trouble? Ouch. That breaks most of my uses of RDF, and a lot of  deployed FOAF documents.  ]]      Specifically we request, that in Owl DL and Owl lite:       a) that a b-node representing an individual may be the object of more  than one triple     b) that cycles of b-nodes representing individuals be allowed.    -------------------------------        

        We want to ensure that all the key concepts are described consistently   across our various docs.    I propose:    o each concept has a natural defining home, e.g. abstract syntax stuff in   concepts, schema stuff in ...    o the editors of the 'natural home' for a concept or term get to define it.    o other editors MUST refer to that definition and MAY quote all/part of it.    o editors MUST NOT create their own definitions for terms or invent terms   whose natural home is in another document    o editors are encouraged to add a glossary to their documents    o we will create an internal WG document for style issues and keep a list   of common terms and their natural home there.

We have agreed a model theoretic test, i.e. does       <a> <b> "foo" .     <c> <d> "foo" .    entail      <a> <b> _:l .    <c> <d> _:l .    If we could express this directly in the XMP api then your suggestion we   would have an objective test.    We can do this in the jena api.  Given a model with the above triples we   can write:       model.contains(c, d, a.getProperty(b).getObject())    In Jena this returns true because Jena is tidy (despite having methods such   as getBoolean, getInteger etc).    Is there a way to express the entailment directly in the XMP api so we can   execute the test?    Brian        

        Pat,    Summary:    You need to do some stuff on:      pfps-02    pfps-06    qu-03      Checking the disposition of semantics comments, I see:    Peter does not accept:    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-02    Is there anything we can do on this one?    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-03    I assume we go ahead with the objection; there is nothing more to say.    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-04    I think we've got that one closed - I'm checking    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-05    I've asked Peter if we can now close this one.    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-06    This one needs further work from you, since we have clarified that  octets are not characters.    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-07    I've re-asked about that one.    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-10    And that one.

        As per my recent posts (sorry for the shotgun effect, I wanted to keep the   threads separate), its been suggested that we can have test case A be yes   and test case C be no.    I just wanted to note that there is an interaction between this test case   and rdfs:subPropertyOf.  Consider:       _:a dc:title "4th July" .     _:b dc:date  "4th July" .    [I don't know DC well enough to know whether this is a realistic example, I   suspect not so consider this just illustrative]    All is reasonably well.  With appropriate datatype range constraints one of   these denotes a string and the other a date.    Now add a common super property for all the dc properties:       dc:property rdf:type        rdf:Property .     dc:title rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:property .     dc:date  rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:property .    This now entails:       _:a dc:property _:l .     _:b dc:property _:l .    I assume this is still monotonic, since I haven't actually retracted   anything, though it sure feels like changing my mind to me.    A more extreme form is to postulate the existence of a common super   property of all properties, which we have talked about in the past.  If   there were such a thing and the answer to A is yes, then we'd have tidy   literals anyway.    At this point I think I need to hear Pat say, "relax".    Brian        

        Well done Jan.  Good to see this moving forward.    test1: rdf is not well formed xml.     xml:lang="fr">10</eg:bar> should be xml:lang="fr">10</eg:baz>    language-important-for-non-dt-entailment-1    this is not what I expected    [[# Language doesn't affect the semantic equivalence of some datatypes,  # when doing a DT-entailment. However, it represents a difference  # when doing DT-unaware entailment.]]    We know that:      <a> <b> "foo"@@en#<datatype> .    <c> <d> "foo"@@fr#<datatype> .    entails      <a> <b> _:l .    <c> <d> _:l .    for all datatypes except rdf:XMLLiteral.    It is not necessary to be datatype aware to figure out this entailment.  I   suppose there is always the possibility that someone has given a different   URI for rdf:XMLLiteral.  Hmm, that's a shame.  Its only true if we know   datatype is distinct from rdf:XMLLiteral.    This feels a bit shady, but I guess you are right.    non-well-formed-literal-2    The representation of a semantic error is that the erroneous triple entails   the empty graph.  I'm not sure this captures it. Any graph entail the empty   graph, right?  I remember something in the model theory about a bad literal   denoting something, just not a datatype.  If I remember rightly we would   have a negative entailment:    <a> <b> "foo"^^xsd:integer    does not entail    <a> <b> _:v .  _:v rdf:type _:c .  _:c rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .    and it does if we replace "foo" with "10".    language-ignored-for-numeric-types-1    The comment:    [[Language doesn't affect the semantic equivalence of some datatypes,  when doing a DT-entailment]]    Where some = all except rdf:XMLLiteral.    semantic-equivalence-between-datatypes    I'd rather we didn't say this at all.  This is a statement about the   features of xml schema datatypes, not about rdf and datatyping.    If we do decide to keep it (grrrr) then I'd suggest formulating it   differently.  The way this is put suggests that      <a> <b> "10"^^xsd:integer .    entails all other datatype representations of the same value.  Suggest instead:      <a> <b> "10"^^xsd:integer .    <c> <d> "1E1"^^xsd:decimal .    entails      <a> <b> _:v .    <c> <d> _:v .    which is more constrained.    Brian

        This is a new draft of this message based on feedback recieved.  I'd like   to approve this for sending at this Friday's telecon.    Changes are:      o minor change to the INTRODUCTION    o explicitly stated B and C must have the same answer    o removed angle brackets from around qname representation of uri's    o pointed out test cases B and C depend on no range constraints    o added deadline for responses      Brian  =============================================================================    The RDFCore WG is producing a proposal for how XML Schema datatypes should   be used in RDF.  We would like some guidance on a particular tradeoff we   have to make.    The WG requests that you send your considered answers to   www-rdf-comment@w3.org, along with any comments, thoughts or questions you   may have.  Please can we have all responses by 12 July 2002.    INTRODUCTION TO DATATYPES  =========================    Let's explain the basic ideas behind our approach to datatyping.  The aim   is to define how datatype values, e.g. integers, dates etc should be   represented in RDF.  It is important in getting the semantics correct that   we distinguish between a datatype value, e.g. the integer 10 and a lexical   representation of the value, e.g. the string "10".    We are proposing two principal idioms for representing datatyped   information.  The first looks like this:       <Jenny> <age>          _:a .     _:a     <xsdr:decimal> "10" .    This can be written in RDF/XML like this.       <rdf:Description rdf:about="Jenny">       <foo:age xsdr:decimal="10"/>     </rdf:Description>    Here the b-node _:a denotes the integer 10 which can be represented in   decimal form as the string "10".    This idiom treats an XML datatype as a mapping from a value to a lexical   representation of the value; this mapping is represented in RDF by a property.    We believe this idiom to be quite straightforward, but not sufficient on   its own because it is common practise to write things like:       <jenny> <age> "10" .    where the author of this fragment of RDF means to represent the fact that   Jenny's age is the number 10.  This is the second idiom, which is where we   need some guidance.      SOME TEST CASES  ===============    It is here that we need some advice, because we have a choice to make in   the way we define the formal semantics.    A few simple test cases:    Test A:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <John>  <ageInYears> "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that the value of the ageInYears   properties for Jenny and John are the same?    Test B:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <Jenny> <testScore>  "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that the value of Jenny's ageInYears   property is the same as the value of Jenny's testScore property?    Note that this question only relates to the situation where there are no   range constraints.  Given compatible range constraints on the properties,   there is no difficulty concluding that the answer is yes.    Test C:       <Jenny> <ageInYears>   "10" .     <Film>  <title>        "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that the value of Jenny's age property is   the same as the value of the Film's title property?  If the value the   <ageInYears> property is an integer, and the value of the <title> property   is a string, they are not the same thing and are thus not equal.    Again this question only relates to the situation where there are no range   constraints on the properties.  Given the appropriate range constraints on   the properties, the answer is clearly no.    Test D:       <Jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .     <ageInYears> rdfs:range xsd:decimal .       <John>  <ageInYears>   _:a .     _:a     xsdr:decimal   "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that Jenny and John have the same   age?  [Note: in this example the range constraint is expressed using   rdfs:range.  We may have to introduce a special datatyping range property,   but that is an independent detail for now.]    It is not possible to have the answers to Test B, Test C and Test D all be   yes.  B and C must also have the same answer.  Either B and C can be yes or   D can be yes.  We have to decide which of these is the most important to   have; (B and C) or D.    WHY THESE TEST CASES MATTER  ===========================    The formal semantics can define the meaning of a literal in one of two ways:       tidy) the <ageInYears> property takes a value which is a numeral, i.e. a   string       untidy) the <ageInYears> property takes a value which is some datatype   value whose string  representation is "10", but without further   information, such as  a range constraint, we can't tell exactly what the value is, e.g. the   string might be in octal.    If we choose the tidy option, the object of the statement is always a   string, which means that in:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <Film>  <title>      "10" .    the values of the two properties are the same; they are both the STRING "10".    If we choose the untidy option, the value of the object object of the   statement is unknown from this statement alone; a range constraint is   required to determine the value from the literal string:       <jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .     <ageInYears> <rdfs:range> <xsd:decimal> .    With a range constraint, we can know that the object of the property is the   integer 10.    CONCLUSION  ==========    To end then, please send a message to www-rdf-comments@w3.org (by 12 July   2002) indicating whether you believe its more important to have the answer   to test case B be yes, or test case D be yes:       Test B:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <Jenny> <testScore>  "10" .    Test D:       <Jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .     <ageInYears> <rdfs:range> <xsd:decimal> .       <John>  <ageInYears>      _:a .     _:a     <xsdr:decimal>   "10" .      We would also like to know the reasons for this preference.    Brian McBride  on behalf of the RDFCore WG

I take Graham's   point about reviewing a moving target.    How about this for a plan:       - detailed review of DT's WD 19th Apr     - final review and approve publication 26th Apr    That means we need a near final for review, by say Monday.

      Jim Hendler has sent a message [1] to the sw coordingation group which states:    [[   >   >If the WebOnt language is to   >   1/ use RDF syntax, and   >   2/ be an extension of RDF, and   >   3/ to be able to entail appropriate class memberships,   >then the WebOnt language needs to have a facility for having RDF triples   >that do not denote in the RDF model theory (a.k.a. dark triples) and URI   >references that do not denote in the RDF model theory (e.g., URI references   >that only exist in dark triples).      The WOWG has reached strong consensus on the above -- we have  determined that the 3 features above are mandated by our charter, and  that we cannot have all three unless RDF core does something with  respect to dark triples (as discussed above) We have several  volunteers from WebOnt WG who will be willing to engage with RDF Core  members in resolving this issue to the satisfaction of both groups  (this includes several people who are in both groups).  ]]    I take that view that we are all in this together and if webont have   reached strong consensus on this issue, this is something RDFCore should   take seriously.  Consensus is often hard fought and is thus valuable.  I   don't think that behaviour that might be construed as confrontational is   helpful.    We asked Jeremy to post a motivating example of the problem and at least to   the best of my understanding, we have had three different responses:      Jeremy: students and employees    Pat:    no example, denying students and employees    Jos:    Peter F. Patel-Schneider's encoding of Russel's paradox in DAML+OIL.    I'm not sure how Pat's description of the problem relates to the PPS   paradox - the paradox may be an example of Pat's general description.    I understand that the PPS paradox, as currently formulated, is no longer an   issue as some of the constructs used in it have been withdrawn from owl.  I   don't know whether that the solves the problem or whether it can be   reconstituted in another form.    What is apparent, is there is no consensus on a description of the problem   that dark triples will fix and how they will fix it.  So the first step is,   I suggest, for the folks who have been involved in the discussion so far to   agree at least on that.  I would expect such descriptions to include both   an abstract, but accessible description of the problem and at least one   concrete example.    Whilst we are aiming for last call is not the most welcome time to receive   new issues.  However, I suggest we should work constructively with webont   to assess this issue and decide how best to deal with it.  Questions of   charter will be for the CG; it may be best to deal with it now, it may be   best to handle it in a new spec synchronized with the webont process.  To   reach an informed consensus on that question, we all need a clearer   understanding of what the problem is, where we are in understanding the   possible solutions and how those solutions relate to other issues we have.    Before we start forming our judgements, lets get the facts sorted out.    Brian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-semweb-cg/2002Apr/0010.html

        I'm not that good at doing the Ra! Ra! thing, but, for folks who were   not there, and may be feeling a little jaded, the Florida semantic web   conference was very well attended and folks I have talked to have   generally considered to have been worthwhile and a success.  An   interesting point to note is that the industrial track was better   attended than expected and had to move to a larger room.    Brian

My understanding is that WG agrees that this works, but that   having two properties is unacceptable.  If we agreed that two properties   was acceptable, then I think all this would just go away.  The argument is   that there will be lots of user error and confusion resulting from having   to distinguish between the two cases.    >I guess I don't have time to keep up. Sorry.

I'm aware of the point about closure.  I thinks there are ways to deal with   that. DanC brought up another point about handling the infinity of rdf:_nnn   properties.  I took that to mean that there are problems e.g. stating that   they are all of type rdfs:Property.    I now realise that it would be somewhat tedious to define an infinite set   of subproperties, e.g. foo:_1 a subproperty of rdf:_1, foo:_2 etc.    Brian

In a previous life, bc (before core), when thinking of the M&S formal model   where it states in:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#162    [[     (P162) There is a set called Statements, each element of which is a   triple of the form    (P163) {pred, sub, obj}  ]]    that this said that all statements (not statings, this is the statements   view) just exist, which is I think, equivalent to anything (and nothing)   entails:       _:s <rdf:type> <rdf:Statment> .     _:s <rdf:subject> <subject> .     _:s <rdf:predicate> <predicate> .     _:s <rdf:object>    <object> .    for any subject, predicate and object.    So I suggest that if we decide that:       <s1> <rdf:type> <rdf:Statment> .     <s1> <rdf:subject> <subject> .     <s1> <rdf:predicate> <predicate> .     <s1> <rdf:object>    <object> .       <s2> <rdf:type> <rdf:Statment> .     <s2> <rdf:subject> <subject> .     <s2> <rdf:predicate> <predicate> .     <s2> <rdf:object>    <object> .       <s1> <prop> <value> .    entails       <s2> <prop> <value> .    then to be consistent we must also decide that anything (and nothing) entails:       _:s <rdf:type> <rdf:Statment> .     _:s <rdf:subject> <subject> .     _:s <rdf:predicate> <predicate> .     _:s <rdf:object>    <object> .    for any subject, predicate and object.

[not n-triples docs]  16:34:04 <scribe> Jan: we've said scope of N-Triples is the N-Triples doc.  16:34:04 <GK-f2f> * GK-f2f so I have a program that reads two different  N-triples documents, and spits out N-triples thayt bresult from merging their  graphs -- I'd describe that as merging the N-triples documents  16:34:22 <scribe> Steve: I think we still have to deal with the scoping issue.  16:34:36 <scribe> ... Ntriples are forcing us to do that.  16:35:13 <scribe> Arno: we ran into this issue at Adobe.  16:35:43 <scribe> ... We have diff docs and compound docs.  We solved it by  16:36:07 <scribe> ... first thinking not about annonNodes but implicitly named  [have a name, wwee dont know what it is]  16:36:25 <scribe> ... We have a mechanism to refer to them.  16:36:54 <scribe> ... What we've said is consistent with our design.  16:37:11 <scribe> Graham: Ntriples is a syntax.  16:37:59 <scribe> Brian: I think we have some agreement but need to test if we  are talking about the same thing.  16:38:25 <GK-f2f> * GK-f2f and a "document" is a character string that matches  poroductiions from the "distinguished symbol" of the N-truiples grammar ... i.e.  a "sentence" of the Np-triples syntax.  16:38:36 <scribe> ... I think Ora and Pat said:  16:38:48 <scribe> ... the fundamental model is the GRAPH MODEL!  16:39:06 <scribe> ... Ntriples is a syntax for a graph [a serialization foor a  graph]  16:39:30 <scribe> ... We can have more than one graph.  16:39:35 <scribe> Pat: yes!  16:40:27 <scribe> Brian: when I merge ntriples, the semantics is that I'm  merging the graphs.  16:41:28 <scribe> ... If we have the two graphs, we can't just concatentate the  corresponding n-triples; must first change some names  16:41:58 <scribe> Brian: does the MT theory, Pat?  16:42:21 <scribe> Pat: yes, the MT must be based on the graph, not on N-Triples.  16:42:40 <scribe> ... won't need the set of triples in a document.  16:43:09 <scribe> Brian: we have an RDF serialization  16:43:17 <scribe> ... we will also have a grammar  16:43:43 <scribe> ... we will define semantics by defining a mapping from  serialization to n-triples  16:43:58 <scribe> ... from n-triples, we have a MT  16:44:15 <scribe> ... Why do we have to change that?  16:45:03 <scribe> Pat: the arrow from ntriples to MT must now go through the  graph  16:45:09 <scribe> ... the graph has a MT  16:45:25 <scribe> ... the advant: separates some issues   16:46:01 <scribe> Graham: will we have a MT based on the graph [not the  ntriples]  16:46:52 <scribe> Ron: want the graph in the middle; put MT in an arc; put  n-triples as an arc, put RDF/XML as a arc  16:47:32 <scribe> Ron: if we split an ntriples doc, how to put it back together?  16:47:57 <scribe> Pat: we can break up graphs.  16:48:28 <scribe> ... In the graph, nodes are nodes.  16:50:14 <scribe> Ron: use case is controlled vocabularies  16:50:33 <scribe> ... a node may have lots of info  16:50:41 <scribe> ... may only want to send some of the info  16:50:52 <scribe> ... can send the identity of the node  16:51:39 <scribe> jan: if you need to talk about it, give it a URI!  16:54:07 <scribe> Sergey: I'm not convinced we're all talking about the same  thing.  16:55:37 <scribe> ... want to explore using annonNodes as existential  quantifiers, etc.  16:56:06 <scribe> ... By looking at these other approaches, we could get more.  16:57:23 <scribe> danbri: I would like to hear Sergey's view.  16:57:50 <scribe> ...

But: since the same procedure  for assigingin constants from A, this is irrelevant.  A can be viewed as subset  of C that is extremely unlikely to be used  17:18:25 <scribe> o Application that neeed not communicate may not local IDs.   If communicate using syntax that contains "holes", fine.  No global  autogeneration algorithm required.  17:19:01 <scribe> o If no standard assignment algorithm is required, ad 1) is  still violated (parsing twice)  17:20:46 <scribe> ....  17:21:13 <scribe> Sergey: there can be a formal mechanism to help base arguments  about anon. nodes.  17:21:41 <scribe> ... point 2: there are multiple options for implementing anon.  nodes [they all have advantages and disadvantages]  17:22:45 <scribe> ... want to ground the decisoion.  This also helps define the  application semantics.  17:22:55 <scribe> Jan: this is very useful.  However, your existance proof is  false.  17:23:28 <scribe> ... You have no way of knowing where things come from.  17:23:56 <scribe> ... The algorithm doesn't reflect that  a URI may return the  same thing through time.  17:25:14 <scribe> Pat: the question is what is the semantics.  Is is temporary  [the doc]?  17:25:26 <scribe> ... M&S is talking about graphs.  17:27:09 <scribe> Sergey: I think explicit genids would be useful.  17:27:34 <jhendler> jhendler has quit  17:28:03 <scribe> Brian: if you parse the same doc, should an anon description  have the same identity?  17:30:25 <scribe> Ron: if everyone generates the same identifier for an anon  node, it could be useful but it also could be dangerous.  17:30:37 <scribe> ... That's the choice: useful vs dangerous.  17:30:54 <scribe> danbri: it is very dangerous.  17:31:22 <scribe> Brian: can you do more things this way?  17:32:07 <scribe> Ron: you can do more things because then you can hang  additional stuff off of it.  17:32:19 <scribe> Jan: there are better ways to do this.  17:32:39 <scribe> Frank: what exactly is the question?  17:33:27 <scribe> Brian: do you need everyone to use the same algorithm?  17:33:49 <scribe> Ron: if folks agree on an algorithm, you can do additional  stuff.  17:35:49 <scribe> Pat:  I don't think these examples are helpful.  They  introduces more confustion.  It doesn't talk about the graph.  17:36:21 <scribe> ... We don't need to introduce the variables.  17:37:32 <scribe> Eric: we need to put a stake in the ground and move on.  We  need to focus on the graph to agree on stuff.  17:38:38 <scribe> Pat: I'll update the MT based on the graph within a week.  17:58:11 <scribe> ======== Break Over =========  18:00:20 <GK-f2f> RDF Syntax -- Dave Beckett Leads  18:01:51 <GK-f2f>  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/people/cmdjb/talks/rdfcore-sebastopol/  18:02:57 <GK-f2f> slide 2  18:03:18 <GK-f2f> slide 3  18:03:24 <GK-f2f> (ntriplesreview)  18:03:27 <GK-f2f> GK-f2f has quit  18:03:31 <jang> jang has joined #rdfcore  18:04:34 <jang> (talks about benefits of ntrlpes as simple serialisation)  18:04:41 <jang> slide 4  18:04:50 <DanCon> DanCon has joined #rdfcore  18:05:21 <jang> dave'd been looking at reexpressing the grammer in terms of the  infoset, rather than '<' etc  18:05:39 <jang> grammar looks simpler, smaller  18:06:23 <jang> we o xml syntax -> ntriples -> graph -> MT  18:06:27 <jang> s/o/go  18:06:39 <jang> points at:  18:06:57 <jang> http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/  18:07:16 <jang> dave points out, as an example, the 6.3 entry in the table  18:07:40 <jang> dve's had to invent a syntax for expressing XML infoset  18:07:57 <jang> slide 5  18:08:31 <jang> change to slide: <=> "the graph" in each case  18:08:50 <jang> dave mentions other formal proposals for syntax notations  18:08:55 <jang> slide 6  18:09:09 <jang> answer to "is ntriples sufficient?"

We must be able to represent the grammar  in something that's as familiar as possible to the other xml techs  18:18:33 <jang> em: likes XDuce; but if it's one of equals he'd prefer sometng  else  18:18:39 <jang> dan: relaxng looks promising too  18:19:03 <jang> danri: if we want others to have a good look at our spec, we  should extend them the same courtesy  18:19:23 <jang> em: only a few people from, eg, DC will be interested in reading  the spec?  18:19:33 <danbri> (re politeness: specifically within the w3c xml family of  specs)  18:19:35 <jang> daveb: we want a single normative mechanism  18:19:46 <jang> em: ebnf, for example.  18:19:54 <jang> daveb: it's basically in terms of characters  18:20:06 <jang> sm: can xslt produce non-xml docuemnts?

it's  going to keep growing  18:21:23 <jang> brian: is ntriple broken? do we anticipate it stopping working?  18:21:34 <jang> ph: the only possible problem is scoping, i think we've resolved  that  18:21:46 <jang> bri: then we stick with ntriple until it's demonstrated that  it's broken  18:22:12 <jang> jang volounteers to help dave with the investigation  18:22:19 <jang> dave asks: can we include jeremy?  18:22:25 <jang> art: also interested  18:22:32 <jang> brian: AP! ask jeremy about this  18:22:42 <jang> dan: suggests schematron to invesigate  18:22:59 <jang> AP: ang, dave, art to investigate and come back with a  reccommendation  18:23:16 <jang> Graham: let's be absolutely clear wat we consider the primary  audience?  18:23:40 <jang> graham: i ask because XSLT exists and may be very good, but it  is probably not very good at expressing the concepts to a human reader  18:23:48 <jang> is the human developer the primay audience?  18:23:50 <jang> bri: yes  18:24:02 <jang> sm: s ntriple going to be xmlised?  18:24:05 <jang> bri: no plans yet  18:24:12 <jang> sm: then we can't use xslt?  18:24:21 <jang> al: no, it can produce anything including text files  18:24:30 <jang> em: it can do tree transforms to text  18:24:40 <jang> steveP: what is the role of the ntriples syntax?  18:24:46 <jang> normative or for testing?  18:24:54 <jang> I'd be opposed (I think) to it being normative  18:25:13 <jang> bri: we need a way to represent the graph. we have to be able to  write down the graph transformation  18:25:20 <jang> bri: in mymind, ntriples is for that  18:25:24 <jang> steve: but it's not a graph  18:25:37 <jang> ph: we could draw pictures in the spec  18:25:54 <jang> we need ntriples for testing, not for the defintiion  18:26:11 <jang> brian: I need some way of writing down my test-cases  18:26:25 <jang> I'd rather use one representation of a gaph  18:26:30 <jang> graph, even  18:26:56 <jang> dave: we've got a mixture of text and formalisms at the moment  18:27:04 <jang> ph: software exists to construct and transmit graphs.  18:27:23 <jang> ph: wy don't we make the exposition in the definitive document  conform to the graph directly?  18:27:40 <jang> every time a graph is pictures, we can give the ntriples  representation  18:28:02 <jang> danbri: i aree largely, but I'd be concerned if we say all sorts  of wooly non-normative thngs about ntriples  18:28:08 <jang> it's as normative as the rest of the spec  18:28:28 <jang> ph: I was responding to brian's desire that ntriples be the way  graphs are described  18:29:19 <jang> fm: one role ntriple could play in the exposition is to  illustrate some of th epotential misunderstandings they may experience  18:29:47 <jang> people have been sending ntriple-ish stuff back and forward for  disambiguation by email  18:29:57 <jang> so ntriples could be used as an example of a serialisation  18:30:02 <danbri> * danbri agrees  18:30:08 <jang> to make the point that the graph model is the central issue  18:30:32 <jang> brian: when I think of ntriple, i think it behaves exatly like a  graph  18:30:46 <jang> ph: all the issues of name scoping have not been properly  articulated  18:31:09 <jang> graham: the advantage of using graphs directly: it'll prevent  opthers from falling into the same mental trap  18:31:32 <jang> em: we've been trynig to do this for 4 years, unsuccessfully:  saying "it's the graph stupid"  18:31:46 <jang> people understand the serialisation more than the abstract  notion  18:31:53 <DanCon> DanCon has left channel  18:31:54 <jang> ora: I don't think that's true.   18:32:19 <jang> people see the serialisation and don't understand it represents  a graph  18:32:28 <jang> em: eg,xml people see it as an xml document  18:32:50 <jang> graham: we should do everything twice in the document: once as a  graph and once as ntriples  18:33:17 <jang> ora: in some sense, choosing xml was a mistake. people see xml  and consider it to be just xml, not a graph  18:33:38 <jang> every time i speak about the graph, people get it though. I've  stopped talking about xml and people just get it  18:33:46 <jang> em: I've seen exacty the opposite  18:34:03 <jang> people ask, "but what does it look like?" meaning, where are the  angle-brackets  18:34:41 <jang> em: people are deploying a lot of apps that just happen to be  rdf-friendly, eg, rss - most users just consider it to be an xml document  18:35:12 <jang> dan: what are we trying to achieve? we're not trying to write  the rdf tutorial or do modelling  18:35:57 <jang> we're not trying to write the tutorial here - in that context,  does anyone have anything else to add?  18:36:20 <jang> mike d: we've produced another serialisation for rdf. if we play  it up, won't people start using it?  18:36:36 <jang> how important is it to emphasise that the xml serialisation is  the preferred syntax  18:36:45 <jang> bri: we're not chartered to develop a new synta  18:37:00 <jang> mike: it's becoming bigger. it's for test cases basically  18:37:24 <jang> ph: it sends a good messge - there are at least two maybe more  serialisations of rdf  18:37:35 <jang> M+S doesn't hammer this home sufficiently  18:37:54 <jang> arno: this can create some confusion. eg, DC has multiple  representations  18:38:14 <jang> documents that have different forms tend to be interpreted  differently  18:38:36 <jang> em: let's not go there yet. it is non-trivial to convince people  to deploy multiple syntaxes  18:38:58 <jang> ph: we either say, there is one preferred syntax, and not  mention any others, or we shoud say  18:39:06 <jang> rdf is about graphs and there may be muktiple syntaxes  18:39:24 <jang> danbri: this has been very important to exaplin to people.  18:39:50 <jang> em: I want that, yes: we're building on the first M+S  18:40:16 <jang> this diagram (referring to the graph -> MT, ntriples,  serialisation diagram) is really importnat  18:40:35 <jang> e: priority should be to clarify the model (graph) and focus on  the rdf xml serialisation  18:41:12 <jang> ora: says "S-expressions" and gets lynched  18:41:12 <jang> brian: moving on to schema  18:41:12 <jang>  minute break, back in a tick...  18:55:51 <jang> back: rdf schema issues  18:56:00 <jang> danbri to lead, brian to timekeep + chair  18:56:15 <jang> eric has noes on laptop  18:56:21 <AaronSw>  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Aug/0003.html  18:56:30 <AaronSw>  - notes  18:56:32 <jang> ap: eric/danbri to ensure dan's document goes online  18:56:41 <scribe> ======== DanBri - RDFSchema ========  18:57:57 <jang> w3c think rdfsch is more or less done  18:58:06 <jang> we've had feedback... particularly from daml+oil  18:58:36 <jang> rdfschema work stopped waiting for xml schema - that's now done  18:58:49 <jang> we need to take the useful bits ( datatypes) into rdf schema  18:59:08 <shellac> shellac has joined #rdfcore  19:00:01 <jang> WG sucessor (web-ontology) is planned  19:00:55 <jang> dan points out: what we decide/do next doesn' have to be writen  in stone, so we make pragmatic ecisions on what the next WD looks like  19:01:55 <jang> domain + range is an open issue; dan proposes we skip over this  because there's a good answer  19:02:19 <jang> this is a no-brainer  19:02:47 <jang> ora gives a bit of background to rdfschema; we're after an OO  extensible type system to rdf  19:03:02 <jang> we're after very little.  19:03:54 <jang> ora: te properties of properties are global - no class-specific  constraints  19:03:59 <jang> we fixed this in daml  19:04:17 <jang> domain + range: this is the open issue  19:05:12 <jang> dan talks about daml work getting pushed into schema/web-ont -  we don't know or care yet what's going to ahappen about this  19:05:23 <jang> dan: ora - class-contextualised constraints may come later  19:05:50 <jang> dan: any dissent to conjunctive interpretation of range+domain?

        I have an outstanding action to point to current editors drafts but have   held off from doing it until I knew that updated drafts were available.    As you will recall we decided to maintain the editors drafts in last call   TR space.    I've had a request for visibility of the editors drafts, so it would be   helpful if you could let me know the current status and plans of updating   your documents.  If you need help with updating access to CVS, I can help out.    Brian

        We discussed this at a telcon, but in case anyone missed it:    The slot we tentatively requested for a WG meeting at the tech plenary is   being used for an open semantic web architecture meeting.  This is on the   Thursday and Friday.  I think I recall hearing that it is already well   subscribed.    I'm not sure where the agenda is. Eric?    Brian

        This is first draft of the datatypes message I agreed to produce at the f2f.    Brian  =============================================================================    The RDFCore WG is producing a proposal for how XML Schema datatypes should   be used in RDF.  We would like some guidance on a particular tradeoff we   have to make.    The WG requests that you send your considered answers to   www-rdf-comment@w3.org, along with any comments, thoughts or questions you   may have.    INTRODUCTION TO DATATYPES  =========================    Let's explain the basic ideas behind our approach to datatyping.  We are   proposing two principal idioms for representing datatyped information.  The   first looks like this:       <Jenny> <age>          _:a .     _:a     <xsdr:decimal> "10" .    This can be written in RDF/XML like this.       <rdf:Description rdf:about="Jenny">       <foo:age xsdr:decimal="10"/>     </rdf:Description>    Here the b-node _:a denotes the integer 10 which can be represented in   decimal form as "10".  The WG believes that this distinction between   numbers, e.g. 10 and numerals (which are strings) e.g. "10" is important if   we are to precisely define the semantics, e.g. 10 # "10".    This idiom treats an XML datatype as a mapping from a value to a lexical   representation of the value; this mapping is represented in RDF by a property.    We believe this idiom to be quite straightforward, but not sufficient on   its own because it is common practise to write things like:       <jenny> <age> "10" .    where the author of this fragment of RDF means to represent the fact that   Jenny's age is the number 10.  This is the second idiom, which is where we   need some guidance.      SOME TEST CASES  ===============    It is here that we need some advice, because we have a choice to make in   the way we define the formal semantics.    A few simple test cases:    Test A:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <John>  <ageInYears> "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that the value of the ageInYears   properties for Jenny and John are the same?    Test B:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <Jenny> <testScore>  "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that the value of Jenny's ageInYears   property is the same as the value of Jenny's testScore property?    Test C:       <Jenny> <ageInYears>   "10" .     <Film>  <title>        "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that the value of Jenny's age property is   the same as the value of the Film's title property?  If the value the   <ageInYears> property is an integer, and the value of the <title> property   is a string, they are not the same thing and are thus not equal.    Test D:       <Jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .     <ageInYears> <rdfs:range> <xsd:decimal> .       <John>  <ageInYears>      _:a .     _:a     <xsdr:decimal>   "10" .    Should an RDF processor conclude that Jenny and John have the same   age?  [Note: in this example the range constraint is expressed using   rdfs:range.  We may have to introduce a special datatyping range property,   but that is an independent detail for now.]    It is not possible to have the answers to Test B, Test C and Test D all be   yes.  Either B and C can be yes or D can be yes.  We have to decide which   of these is the most important to have; (B and C) or D.    WHY THESE TEST CASES MATTER  ===========================    The formal semantics can define the meaning of a literal in one of two ways:       tidy) the <ageInYears> property takes a value which is a numeral, i.e. a   string       untidy) the <ageInYears> property takes a value which is some datatype   value whose string  representation is "10", but without further   information, such as  a range constraint, we can't tell exactly what the value is, e.g. the   string might be in octal.    If we choose the tidy option, the object of the statement is always a   string, which means that in:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <Film>  <title>      "10" .    the values of the two properties are the same; they are both the STRING "10".    If we choose the untidy option, the value of the object object of the   statement is unknown from this statement alone; a range constraint is   required to determine the value from the literal string:       <jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .     <ageInYears> <rdfs:range> <xsd:decimal> .    With a range constraint, we can know that the object of the property is the   integer 10.    CONCLUSION  ==========    To end then, please send a message to www-rdf-comments@w3.org indicating   whether you believe its more important to have the answer to test case B be   yes, or test case D be yes:       Test B:       <Jenny> <ageInYears> "10" .     <Jenny> <testScore>  "10" .    Test D:       <Jenny>      <ageInYears> "10" .     <ageInYears> <rdfs:range> <xsd:decimal> .       <John>  <ageInYears>      _:a .     _:a     <xsdr:decimal>   "10" .      We would also like to know the reasons for this preference.    Brian McBride  on behalf of the RDFCore WG        

      This sounds like good progress Jan.  Don't forget you don't have to do all   the work yourself, you can ask for volunteers to help if you can identify   bits of work that can be split off.

      I have reviewed the responses to the proposed partitioning of our problem  space, and I'd like to take a shot at summing up (not summarizing) the  results.    There seems to unanimity in the responses for a partition of the  technical issues into:      o an abstract syntax and semantics (previously called core)    o schema    o vocabularies    o RDF/XML syntax    There is some disagreement over what must be explicity dealt with in  the abstract syntax and semantics, specifically, whether it must have  explicit representation for reification, for type and for Class.    Ron made the excellent point, that before we go off creating new  designs, we ought to be clear what our requirements are.    I suggest that there is enough agreement around this broad partitioning,  that with the specific proviso that we remain open minded for the moment   about where reification, type and class belong, that we can start to  move forward with each partition in parallel.    Brian        

        Folks,    I spoke with PatH on the phone last night and here is my understanding of   the situation:       o Pat agreed with Peter that there was an error in the semantics   document and that there should indeed be further semantic constraint of the   extension of rdfs:Literal.  This was an editorial error.       o Pat has an updated version of the semantics document that corrects the   error which he would try to email to me for uploading in TR space to update   the LCC.  Unfortunately, Pat is having connectivity problems and that email   is now overdue.  I'll let folks know as soon as I have it.       o Pat believes that the updated document addresses Peter's concerns,   except that there was one remark that puzzled him.  This was Peter's   comment that plain literals are not a datatype.  It is true that plain   literals are not a datatype.  This has been the case for some time, and we   currently have no plans to change this.    I hope this brief update will let folks know where things stand pending   Pat's regaining full communications capability.    Brian      At 09:00 14/01/2003 -0500, Peter F.

        Up till now we have been using an issue driven process and that has served   us well, but now that we are down to one open issue, we must change.  Our   goal now is drive forward to last call.  We have been out of time for a   while now.  We have to get done.  To do that we need to adopt a more   document focused process aimed at getting each document to last call status.    I suggest therefore, that each telecon, as well as dealing with any issues   arising, choses one or more documents to focus on for that telecon.  I will   be calling on the editors to propose dates when they expect to have their   last call candidates ready for review.

        4.5 parseType="Literal"    The RDF/XML syntax is designed to make it easy for the values of  properties to be fragments of XML.  Whilst this feature may be used with  arbritary fragments of XML, it was designed specifically  to enable the values of properties to be rich text represented as  XML markup.    For example, A publisher might maintain RDF meta data that includes the  titles of books and articles.  Whilst such titles are often just simple  strings of characters, this is not always the case.  The titles of books  on mathematics may contain mathematical formulae, that could be  represented using MathML [@@REF].  Titles may include markup, for  example for bidirectional rendering, for Ruby annotations or special  glyph variants.    For example  [@@complete namespaces etc]:      <rdf:Description>      <dc:title rdf:parseType="Literal">  <!-- @@spelling? -->        <span xml:lang="en">          The <em><br /></em> Element Considered Harmful.        </span>      </dc:title>    </rdf:Description>    describes a graph containing one triple:      _:a <dc:title> " \        <span xml:lang="en" xmlns:dc="@@"> \           The <em><br /></em> Element Considered Harmful. \        </span>"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .  # @@ needs checking    The rdf:parseType="Literal" attribute in the RDF/XML indicates that all  the XML within the <dc:title> element is an XML fragment that is the  value of the dc:title property.    The value of the property is a typed literal, whose datatype,  rdf:XMLLiteral, is defined by RDF, specifically to represent fragments  of XML.  The XML fragment is canonicalized according to the XML  Exclusive Canonicalization recommendation [@@ref].  This causes  declarations of used namespaces to be added to the fragment, the  escaping of reserved characters such as '<', '>' and '&', and possibly,  the re-ordering of attributes.  Contextual attributes, such as xml:lang  and xml:base are not inherited from the RDF/XML document, and, if  required, must, as shown in the example, be explicitly specified in the  XML fragment.    This example illustrates that care must be taken designing RDF data.  It  might appear at first, that titles are simple strings best represented  as plain literals, and only later might it be discovered that some  titles contain markup.  In cases where the value of a property may  sometimes contain markup and sometimes not, then either  rdf:parseType="Literal" should be used throughout, or software must  handle both plain literals and rdf:XMLLiteral's.        

        The RDF Semantics document specifies the formal semantics of RDF(S).  It   includes an informative appendix       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#Lbase    which restates the semantics in the form of a small set of axioms.  The   intent is that this representation is easier to understand.    RDFCore have had a last call comment suggesting this appendix be removed:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0092.html    It would be helpful in resolving this comment, for the WG to have feedback   on whether or not folks find this appendix useful.    Brian

I don't think so.  I don't know what a "non-mnemonic" test is, but I do   understand that the test you are using is a test for something other than   the definition of tidyness the WG has been using, since it can produce   different results.

It rests on the iff   semantics of the subclass relationship.    Brian

I just thought it would be useful to  know what m&s says on the subject.  There's some more:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#216      As defined by XML, the character repertoire of an RDF string is    ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO10646]. An actual RDF string, whether in an XML document    or in some other representation of the RDF data model, may be stored using    a direct encoding of ISO/IEC 10646 or an encoding that can be mapped to     ISO/IEC 10646. Language tagging is part of the string value; it is     applied to sequences of characters within an RDF string and does not have    an explicit manifestation in the data model.    Brian

Have your colleagues considered how the lint program might be adapted to   cope with some exceptions where classes and properties are not disjoint,   e.g. don't issue the warning when its a datatype property?

      Here is my interpretation of the notes Pat sent me outlining his ideas on  a model theory for RDF.  I've taken one or two hopefully minor liberties  with the original (which I've included at the end for comparison):      I've introduced the notion of a set P of properties    I've introduced the notion of a set of Strings    I've couched it in terms of an interpretation of n-triples    As I said in the telecon - all credits to Pat, all mistakes are mine.    Here goes:      Let U be the set of URI References (as defined by RDF 2396).                                          //ignore lang and namespaces for now  Let S be the set of of UNICODE strings (UNICODE*)    An interpretation I consists of:    A set R of thingies    A subset P of thingies which corresponds to Properties    A mapping IN : U -> R    A mapping IEXT : P -> R x R            // R cross R    A mapping IS : S -> R    <s> <p> <o> .  is true in I if and only if:       s, o are members of U, p is a member of P     (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(I(P))    <s> <p> "string" . is true in I if and only if:       s is a member of U, p is a member of P and string is a member of S     (IN(s), IS(string)) is a member of IEXT(I(p))    Pat goes on to demonstrate a use of this base model theory to  define the meaning of reification:    I(rdf:subject) = { ((s,p,o), s) : s is a member of U, p is a member of P,                                    o is a member of U union S }    similarly for rdf:predicate and rdf:object.    Pat points out an issue with reification, and I have another,  but I suggest we get the base model theory sorted out before we get  into that.    And Pat's original notes:    Its very simple, really. An interpretation I (of a namespace) is a   set R of thingies and a mapping extI (for relational EXTension) from   R to sets of pairs of thingies, and an interpretation mapping from   identifiers (in the namespace) into R.  (Literals are required by law   to map to a certain subset of thingies in a predefined way, but   otherwise are treated like any other names.)  The triple  s P o is true in I just when 's' 'P' and 'o' are all in the namespace and  <I(s),I(o)> is in extI(I(P)); otherwise it is false in I.    (If someone wants to insist that properties *are* their relational   extension, that amounts to insisting that extI is the identity on R,   which is a special case. However the set R might then not be   well-founded (ie there might be membership loops among its members)   which many mathematicans are uncomfortable with since its   inconsistent with ZF set theory; but there are perfectly good modern   set thoeries that allow it. But this is rather an arcane matter which   can usefully be ignored by non-mathematicians.)    For reification, we require that there are a special class of   thingies corresponding to triples and names, and give special   interpretations for the 'subject'and 'object' and 'predicate'   properties as follows (I'll just do 'subject')  I('subject')= {< [s P o] , s> : s,P,o in namespace(I) }  where [x y z] indicates the thingie in R that stands for the triple   with subject x, property y and object z.    A few issues that crop up for reification (1) do we want to say that   the things in the domain *are* the triples, or are just some category   of things that are 1:1 with the triples? (2) The way Ive stated it,   each theory can only reify triples made from its own namespace. Is   this adequate, or do we want reification to include all possible   names (even those involving URIs that havnt been invented yet)?    Brian

However, it also means that tools like Jena will be compelled to   support it, but won't be able to write it as n-triples or RDF/XML.  I know   that it is already the case that we can't write all graphs as RDF/XML, but   Jena will find a non standard way to fix that, and I don't want that   happening more often than it has to.

I think one of the issues we have here is that we are bit behind with the   vocabulary document and that is leaving a bit of a hole.  In this regard I   think I am agreeing with some comments Graham made earlier.    I suggest that any normative statements that must be made about vocabulary   terms, but that are not model theoretic in nature, are made in the   vocabulary document.    That way, Pat is free to slim down the semantics document.    Please can we just get on and write up the decisions that we have already made.    Brian

      Minor editorial corrections are being considered by the RDFCore working   PR document.  Attached is an htmldiff comparing the PR version and the   edbb version taken at around 1000 15 Jan 2004.    http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semantics_2004bc.html    md5 checksum (after substituting \n for \r) is   be38c1e686336b375bc758384c0770a5    Brian          text/html attachment: sem-pr-edbc.html          

        I just noticed an editorial (?) tweak (pointed out by pfps) to the  semantics document that the semantic constraint that properties must be  a subset of resources has been removed from the current editors draft.    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#interp    Pat, this is rather more than just an editorial tweak.    1. M&S states that properties are a subset of resources  2. Object oriented implementations of RDF typically have property  objects that are subclass of resources - is that still an accurate  design?  3. I've seen no last call comment that justifies the change    The claim in the change log that it does not affect entailments is  false.  Test case:      sss ppp ooo .    rdf entail      ppp rdf:type rdf:Resource .    I believe the answer should be yes, but in any case the answer is  distinguishable in RDF.    Brian        

        Pat, Peter,    I think the Schema Doc and the semantics doc are now in sync on these so   I'm proposing a formal motion to close below.  Please let us know if   there's a problem I missed.    ------------    RDFCore,    Sitting together, Danbri and I have been reviewing issue       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-25    that concerns a number of discrepancies between the schema doc and the   semantics doc.    The first point is:    [[  - Schema states ``Each instance of rdfs:Datatype is a subclass of     rdfs:Literal'', but this is only a consequence of D-interpretations, not     RDFS-interpretations.  ]]    The current editors draft of the semantics doc       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdfs_interp    now says that this relationship is a consequence of RDFS -   interpretations.  Pat please can you confirm this.    [[  - Schema states ``rdf:XMLLiteral is an instance of rdfs:Datatype and a     subclass of rdfs:Literal''.   The second part of this is not even a     consequence of D-interpretations.  ]]    These assertions are now also included in RDFS interpretations as stated in   the editors draft of the semantics doc:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdfs_interp    Pat - confirm?    [[  - Schema states  ``The rdfs:domain of rdf:type is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:label is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:comment is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:comment is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:member is rdfs:Resource.''   @@@@@@  ``The rdfs:range of rdfs:member is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:range of rdfs:first is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:range of rdf:subject is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:range of rdf:resource is rdf:Property.''  I presume Peter meant the range of rdf:Predicate is rdf:Property  ``The rdfs:range of rdf:object is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:seeAlso is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:range of rdfs:seeAlso is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:isDefinedBy is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:range of rdfs:isDefinedBy is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:domain of rdfs:value is rdfs:Resource.''  ``The rdfs:range of rdfs:value is rdfs:Resource.''     but none of these are consequences of RDFS-interpretations.  (Well,     actually Semantics is vague about most of these, as there is a vague     addendum to the conditions on RDFS-interpretations that indicates that     some domain and range assertions ``may be taken to be rdfs:Resource''.     In my view this vagueness is inappropriate for the definition of     RDFS-interpretations.)  ]]    Semantics is no longer vague about these.  It specifies them as above,   except that the one marked @@@@@ is incorrectly stated.    Propose:       1) modify the semantics document to state that the rdfs:domain of   rdfs:member is rdfs:Resource.     2) that the current semantics editors WD, modified as per 1) addresses   this comment    Brian

I'm struggling to find words to   describe what you are trying to express.    Maybe Nokia could submit a note on the b-node idiom for representing   whatever this is.  There is a good chance it would gain wide   acceptance.  There are many things we are not standardizing.  I'm not sure   what's special about this one.    And as for it being in M&S, this seems to be bound up with datatypes.  M&S   didn't say anything about datatypes, and I don't see how we are taking   anything away from M&S (noting that rdfs:range was in schema) that affects   this issue.    Brian

      Apart from a real nitpick which should not stop approval of the test case, I've   reviewed these and they look ok to me.    M&S states a convention that classes are named beginning with a capital letter.  Test 2 has a class 'node'.

      I decided to take a pass through M&S to understand what it says about anon  resources.  I've made a list of sections which I found relevant which I've  included here (almost) without comment, as crib sheet for others who wish  to do the same.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#33        Resources are always named by URIs plus optional    anchor ids    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#34      Resources are identified by a resource identifier. A resource identifier    is a URI plus an optional anchor id    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#41      The intention of this sentence is to make the value of the Creator property    a structured entity. In RDF such an entity is represented as another     resource. The sentence above does not give a name to that resource; it is     anonymous, so in the diagram below we represent it with an empty oval:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#44    The structured entity of the previous example can also be assigned a unique  identifier.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#52      If the resource does not yet exist (i.e., does not yet have a resource    identifier) then a Description element can supply the identifer for    the resource using an ID attribute.      The structured entity of the previous example can also be assigned a     unique identifier.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#56      A Description element without an about attribute represents a new     resource. Such a resource might be a surrogate, or proxy, for some    other physical resource that does not have a recognizable URI.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#100    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#108    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#132    This next paragraph is significant.  It is describing the translation of the  RDF/XML to the abstract syntax defined in M&S and describes a translation  the resource in the abstract syntax has no identifier.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#199     r is       the resource whose identifier is given by the value of the about      attribute of the Description or         a new resource whose identifier is the value of the ID attribute of the     Description, if present; else the new resource has no identifier.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#205      The Description element itself represents an instance of a Bag resource.    The members of this Bag are the resources corresponding to the reification     of each of the statements in the Description. If the bagID attribute is     specified its value is the identifier of this Bag, else the Bag is     anonymous.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#208      When aboutEachPrefix is specified with Description, the statements in the    Description refer to each of the members of an anonymous Bag container.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#232      r2 is the resource named by the resource attribute if present or a new    resource. If the ID attribute is given it is the identifier of this new     resource.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#235      The value of the bagID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for the     Bag corresponding to the Description D; else the Bag is anonymous.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#244    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#248    Brian

Note the issue specifically asks about a mime-type for rdfs:       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#mime-types-for-rdf-docs    [[  Issue mime-types-for-rdf-docs: What mime type should RDF Schema and   other RDF documents have?  ]]    There is the WG's original decision documented in item 8 in the minutes.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0112.html    which is a WG decision that this issue can be closed by defining a   mime-type for RDF/XML documents.    The WG considered that issue and decided.  That you asked the same   question again later doesn't change the fact of the WG's decision.    >   > I don't believe it's a serious enough issue - all things considered -  > to hold up going to Rec,    Whew!      though I do believe it (the use  > of application/rdf+xml for messages which assume RDF Schema inference)  > an architectural flaw that will need to be addressed at some point.  > Hence my request for a decision to be rendered.    If you take this to the TAG, you are going to have to explain what is   special about RDFS (or some small set of RDF vocabularies) or that   mime-types are an appropriate mechanism to use to specify arbitrary   required processing of published documents, which I think will be a very   tough sell.    Another approach to this would be to take your *requirement* (i.e. a   mime-type for rdfs is a solution, not a requirement) up with the (about   to be?) proposed rdf best practices WG.  You could email Guus Schreiber   and see if they would be willing to take it on.  If not then you could   go to the SW coordination group and see what they (we) have to say.   Its a bit of long winded dance, but then, if all that fails, you will   have done all you can before escalating to the TAG, if escalation is how   you see it.    Brian

        Hi Dan,    I have reviewed this and it looks good.    Two nits - neither critical.    1) in [[The rdfs:subClassOf property may be used to state that one class  is a subclass of another.]] the rdfs:subClassOf could be linked to the  property definition.    2) A similar sentence for subPropertyOf could be included in the  description of subproperty.

      Hi Mike,    This is a good question, and an opportunity for me to check an assumption.    Within the context of the S proposal, I've been assuming that the value   spaces of XSD datatypes are resources and we could assign URI's to   them.  Thus if eg:int denotes the value space xsd:integer, we could define       <foo:someProperty> <rdfs:range> <eg:int> .    xsd:integer would have a domain constraint:       <xsd:integer> <rdfs:domain> <eg:int> .    and thus given       <bar> <foo:someProperty> _:int .     _:int <xsd:integer> "10" .    we can infer       _:int <rdf:type> <eg:int> .    by two different routes.

        A further possible RDFCore comment on the owl docs.    -------------------------------    owlref-rdfcore-relationship-to-RDF    RDFCore are concerned about the clarity in the OWL specifications of what   RDF is legal OWL DL and OWL lite.  This seems to be described only in S+AS   which is a highly technical document and is likely to be inaccessible to   many.  On reviewing the reference document some significant restrictions   were not apparent to the RDFCore reviewer.  We cannot be confident,   therefore, that other restrictions we would care about, have not been missed.    RDFCore requests therefore, that the specifications be amended to include a   description of necessary conditions for a RDF document to be in OWL DL and   OWL Lite.  This description should be as accurate as possible consistent   with a goal of it being comprehensible to a majority of the community.    Such a description may bring to light further issues.    -------------------------------         

        I noticed in section 4.2    [[  RDFS Entailment Lemma. S rdfs-entails a graph E if and only if the  rdfs-closure of the merge of S with repect to the combined vocabulary of  S and E simply entails E.  ]]    I had trouble parsing that - what is a merge with respect to a  vocabulary?  I can't figure out what this means so can't suggest an  alternative, but do suggest and intro phrase:    [[  A set of graphs S rdfs-entails ...  ]]    Brian

I'm still at the point of looking for a use case to demonstrate that   markup integrity is a real problem.    You suggested that your issue has to do with multiple users doing the   same thing differently and I asked you to refine the use case we have   been discussing to better illustrate your issue.    I don't see how this use case illustrates a problem with markup   integrity; rather it assumes that problem.    Brian        

        I've been trying to catch up on where we have got to with datatypes whilst   I've been away.  Here is my short summary so folks can straighten out kinks   in my understanding.    1)  There has been a proposal to have tokens representing datatyped values   as nodes in the abstract syntax, replacing (?) the bnode with property   mechanism for representing typed values.  This proposal relies on   extensions to the concrete syntax, e.g.       <age xsi:type="xsd:decimal">10</age>    This proposal has been attracting support, particularly from   implementors.  There remain a number of issues to work out the details.    2)  This proposal is orthognonal to the issue of whether "old style"   literals are tidy or not.  No one has as yet written up a summary of the   feedback we got from the community.  I will try to do a draft tomorrow.    Brian

      I had an action from the face to face to propose a structure for the documents  the WG is to produce.  Below is a strawman for discussion.    Brian      Objectives  ==========     o Provide precise, formal specifications of the RDF abstract model,     the RDF/XML syntax, RDF Schema and RDF vocabularies     o Provide understandable, readable, approachable explanations to users     of RDF and RDF Schema.    Target Audience  ===============    The audience for these docuements can be broken down as follows:     o Managers etc who want to know what RDF is about and whether they     should be using it.     o Authors of technical books on XML, the semantic web etc.  The role     of developing tutorial material for the bulk of developers is filled     by the folks who write these books.     o Higher layer semantic web standards designers who will build more     expressive capabilities on top of RDF.     o Tool builders who design and implement tools that use RDF.     o Data modellers who will design new data models using RDF.     o application developers    Principles  ==========     o Strong separation of explanatory material from the hard core     specifications.  Only the hard core specifications are normative.     o Use of formal techniques in the specifications where possible.      Documents  =========    Overview  --------    Purpose:  High level introduction to RDF and guide to other documents.            All that a manager needs to read to understand broadly what            RDF is trying to do without getting into how it does it.            Answers questions like "What is RDF?", "What would my            organisation use it for?", "Where does it fit into the            family of XML, metadata and semantic web specifications?",            "What do I read next?" and "What is defined and how can             it be extended?".    Audience: Everyone with any interest in RDF.  This is the  first document            a newbie reads.  It's the only document someone needing only            a high level view of what RDF is and what its for should need            to read.    Size:     2-3 printed pages    Status:   Non-normative    Style:    Short, concise, readable.      Tutorial  --------    Purpose:  A tutorial introduction and explanation of the RDF specifications.    Audience: The primary target audience for this document is the book author.              The main goal of this document is to make the specifications            accessible to the book writing community, so that they can fill            in the gaps and write complete tutorials in their books.              This document will also be used by those who eschew the books and            and want to figure stuff out for themselves from the            specifications.    Coverage: Sections covering all aspects of the RDF specs including the            abstract model, the RDF/XML syntax, RDF Schema and basic            vocabularies such as reification and containers.    size:     approx 20-30 printed pages    style:    explanatory    status:   non-normative      RDF Model  ---------    purpose:  Formal specification of the RDF abstract model.    audience: Higher layer designers, tool builders, authors    coverage: Graph model, n-triple representation, model theory,            n-triple formal grammar as non-normative appendix    size:     < 10 printed pages    style:    Formal    status:   normative        RDF Schema  ----------    purpose:  Formal specification of RDF Schema    audience: Higher layer designers, tool builders, authors    coverage: type, Class, etc and their model theory            Vocabularies - reification and containers and their model theory            XML Schema data types            links to test cases    size:     < 20 pages    style:    formal spec, no explanatory material    status:   normative      RDF/XML Syntax  --------------    purpose:  Formal specification of the RDF/XML grammar and its            transformation to a graph.    audience: Higher layer designers, tool builders and authors    coverage: relationship to XML, grammar, transform to graph,            links to test cases    size:     < 10 pages    style:    formal spec, no explanatory material    status:   normative      Test Cases  ----------    purpose:  Machine executable illustrative test cases which illustrate            various aspects of the specifiations.  Not exhaustive.  Not            a validation test suite.  Explanatory examples.    audience: All except managers    coverage: everything    size:     ?    style:    machine executable with comments    status:   normative  (@@??)

I'm wondering what you mean here by 'relying' on vocabularies.  Reification  is currently defined using rdf:type, rdf:subject etc.  Those are  vocabularies.    >   > - as defined in M&S, reification is extremely verbose and clumsy both in  > APIs and in the syntax, and very few people are using it as suggested.  > However, I personally believe it is a useful feature when introduced  > correctly and compactly, and it can be easily handled in APIs and  > databases as an intrinsic model feature.    Absolutely.  >   > Finally, (s1 p1 (s2 p2 o2)) looks nicer in the abstract syntax...    Right.  Much neater and simpler.  However ...    There has been a bunch of discussion lately on www-rdf-logic about this.  It would be very helpful if one someone who understands these issues  (far) better than I (Pat, FrankM, ?  please) could summarize the key points -  and  straighten me out if what I'm about to say is wrong.    The upshot of that discussion is that there are (at least) two different  concepts floating about, distinguished by the ideas of 'use' and 'mention'.    The simplest examples to distinguish these I have seen are:      London is a city.    'London' is a word.    The first of these is use, the second is mention of the name 'London'.    A logical language needs both mechanisms.  Reification, as described in  M&S is an example of mention e.g. Ralph said 'the sky is blue'.    My working assumption at the moment is that reification is a different  mechanism from nested expressions.  If we use nested expression syntax  to represent reification, then a future working group can't use it  to represent nested statements.    Brian

That was Peter's point.  These can be part of a syntically correct RDF   graph and the semantics doc allows them to have a meaning, so in his   view, they are not an error.    At this point I should give up speaking for him.    Brian

An   alternative dichotomy is around how the typing information is represented.  We   can either have a literal as a structured entity, of which the type is a part,   or the typing info can be represented in the triple structure.      In the case where typing information is represented in schema, can typing   information only be represented in a schema?  i.e. is it possible to represent   typing info in a graph which is not a schema?

Are 'Pounds' a type?  Methinks the type is   either integer or float.  Pounds are a unit.  Perhaps this should be:         John_Smith weight [units pounds, rdf:value                                         [rdf:type xsd:int, rdf:value "10"]]    if I've got my n3 correct.    Is 'decimal' a type?  I'm thinking it is a coding scheme for integers (or floats   for that matter.  Why do I feel the gentle tugging of an enormous black hole   opening up in front of me here.

If we think that the best approach would require us to make   changes that are in conflict with our charter, I'd rather see us resolve the   charter issue and do the right thing.      >   > (C2) comparing values for custom or unknown datatypes  >      (Is myint:05==myint:5?

I have a strong preference for not requiring an   external schema.      >   > (C4) are multiple type assignments allowed? (e.g. US dollar, decimal)      As above, I don't see either of these as a 'type', so I'm not sure this   critereon is well formed.  Nor is it a criterion, unless a preference for one or   the other is specified.      >   > (C5) compactness (verbosity of serialization, storage efficiency in  > databases, elegant APIs)      I'd suggest another.  We would have a lot of explaining to do if webont were to   use a different typing mechanism from us.  An important consideration is that we   choose an approach that works for that community, currently represented by   DAML+OIL.  In saying that, I'm not suggesting that we must adopt their current   solution; but we must strive for a solution acceptable to them.    Brian

        A few remarks in response to Jeremy's analysis to test my understanding:    1) liked closing remarks about focus on pragmatic concerns.    2) Examining monotonicity, where it matters and where it doesn't is   interesting avenue.    I believe that monotonicity is important for technical reasons in the model   theory, but that both tidy and untidy semantics can be made to work there.    My understanding is that IT systems are often non-monotonic.  (Database   query: is Fred an employee?  No.  Update database.  Is Fred and   employee?  Yes.)  This suggests that nonmon may not be much of a problem   for IT style applications.    However, there are a lot of folks in the semantic web community who wish to   take a more "logic programming" approach.  I suspect, for them, nonmon   would be a serious problem.    3) I think we demonstrated before that nonmon can be avoided with tidy   semantics if we introduce another property.  Now before I get jumped on   from a great height, I think we have accepted that the user community don't   want to introduce multiple properties into their schemas.  I'm not   suggesting that.    But, when an application gets the bitsPerPixel property value as a string   and converts it to an integer, we could think of that as creating a new   property with a new value:        _:s <bitsPerPixelAsInteger> xsd:int"8" .    I think that would be monotonic.    IT style application designers may never think that this is what they are   doing.  Logic programmers for whom nonmon is a concern could explicitly   code in this style.

        Dave,    Now that you and jjc have agreed revised text for bnode ids in the   syntax doc, do you think it would be a good idea to run it past pfps.    Brian

Boo!      Update boilerplate:       Used trailing initials, initials per Pat's suggestion.  Trailing - dunno   why.       work in progress       switched to [RDF-VOCABULARY] - not also changed the frag ids to match.    Its not a big deal to get these right for this publication.

      At the F2F we took a show of hands for those interested in working on a RDF   Primer as one of the RDF Core deliverables.  I'm interested in re-polling   this group to identify individuals interested in working on such a   Primer.  If there is a large enough group interested, I propose we   form a sub-group to produce a pre-Working Draft Primer for review by   whole WG by, lets say... the middle of October.    If you are willing to write some of this document, please send email to the  list.  I'll also be looking for a couple of folks to take on the burden of  organising this sub-group, so if you have the bandwidth please let me know  (publicly or privately as you prefer).    Brian

OWL already depends on them being there.    That seems pretty clear cut - by the time the RDF gets to an Owl (lite or   DL) processor the rdf:type triples need to be there.  But that's processing   model talk.    So, forgive me talking processing model a little - then I'll get back on   message.    We could envisage a processing chain where RDF gets fed through some RDFS   based inference process before going into an Owl processor to put the   rdf:type triples back in, if they were omitted by a parser.  Part of what   Jeremy calls an Owl Tidy.  More simply we could envisage a parser that had   a switch to control whether these rdf:type triples were generated or   not.  The latter of these seems an appropriate pragmatic approach, if the   WG felt that the presence of the rdf:type triples is a problem.    Whilst we don't talk about processing model we might add a note to the   syntax doc saying something like:    [[  Note:  The (x, rdf:type, rdf:List) triples are required for some   applications, e.g. Owl lite and DL processors, but may be redundant and   unnecessary for some applications.  Implementations may provide a facility   not to generate these triples where there presence would be unhelpful.  ]]    Whether or not we included such a note we could response to Tim along the   lines of:    [[  The RDFCore WG has considered your last call comment       URL    and resolved       URL    to reject it on the grounds that Owl Lite and DL relies on the presence of   these triples.    The WG notes however, that there is nothing to preclude an implementation   from not generating them in circumstances where they are not   needed.  Further, a general purpose RDF processor, such as a parser, could   be built in such a way that the generation of these triples is   configurable, and there is no requirement that the default configuration is   that they should be generated.    Possible words about adding note to the document, if the WG decides to   adopt it.  ]]        

        Actually, I think you should use the dated version.  I suggest using the   date 20030117 as that is our target publication date.

      Hi folks,    A happy new year to all and welcome back.  I hope you are doing better at   swapping RDF context back in than I've been managing.    This is the usual call for agenda items for this Friday's telecon.  Please   may I have suggestions by noon UK time, Thursday.    I see we have some syntax issues to discuss.  Graham, as I recall raised a   question about the structure of the document set and there is still the   question of datatypes.    Brian

I regret the use of the emotive term 'bullied'.  I see no evidence of the   XML schema folks putting any pressure on us about the use of this term.    I have however observed a tendency from folks, and not just those from the   XML world, to assume that a schema language supports validation and this   can cause some confusion.    Personally, whilst I can see advantage to a name change, I think its too   late, but as always, will be guided by the wisdom of the WG.    Brian

      nitpickings (cringingly):    o table of contents numbering does not match section numbering    o section 1, para 2      I was a little confused about what two sets were being discussed.

Delete it, or move it later?    o section 1, para 13      typo - missing bracket      I(E) = true iff <I(s), I(o)> ...                      ^    o section 1, later      a b c, c a a etc should be <a b c>, <c a a> for consistency    o section 1, 2nd last para      typo - missing space      I(<a bc>          ^    o section 2, para before 2a      typo "qua nodes"?    o section 2a, para 3      Each arc (triple) labeled with <s p o>      Arc's are labeled with p, not <s p o>, possibly:      Each arc from node s to node o with label p ...    o section 5, para 2      "germane to questions of bag identity"      I'm confused by the bag identity stuff.  A bag is a resource which is    identified by a URI, not by its contents.  Maybe equals, equivalence?    Or am I missing the point here?    o section 5, para 3      "containers are a series on IR"      a series on IR union LV?    Brian                      ^                          ^        

      Please can we have volunteers to review these test cases so we can close   this issue off at this weeks telecon.

I'm not following you here Dave.      <rdf:Description>      <foo:bar rdf:ID="rs">foobar</foo:bar>    </rdf:Desscription>    is clearly legal and the rdf:ID attribute defines the URI of the refied  statement the property represents.  The question that arises is whether      <rdf:Description>      <foo:bar rdf:resource="http://foo/" rdf:ID="rs"/>    </rdf:Description>    is legal, with again the rdf:ID attribute defining the URI of the reifed  statement.  It does seem a bit irregular to allow the use of an rdf:ID  attribute to identify the reifed statement in the case where the object  is a literal, but not in the case where it is a resource.  And strictly  speaking, the grammar does not rule it out as the rdf:resource attribute  matches the idAboutAttr? in the production and the rdf:ID attribute  matches the propAttr*.    Brian

I had my stronger/weaker notions mixed up apparently.  I had taken  stronger to mean more restrictive, i.e. that      c1 owl:subClassOf c2    |=      c1 rdfs:subClassOf c2    But that isn't the case, right?    Brian

      Hi folks,    I'm sorry that this is late again;  I've been in a meeting all day.  This   is the usual weekly call for items for this weeks telecon.  On my list of   possibles are things we didn't get to on last weeks telecon, the datatypes   doc as a possible for first publication.  I'm behind on the email; its   great to see there has been a deal of enthusiastic activity on the test   cases doc but I'm not sure of the present status - so for now I'll just say   if there is text or test cases in need of review, please review them; Jan   if you can provide some guidance on what would be most helpful to you,   please do.    Brian        

      Summary:  the URI folks:       o agree that we can turn frag id's into absolute uri's     o do not agree that we can use xml:base in that calculation     o have suggested the definition of a uri scheme to represent the current   xml:base value    --    On Wed 10th April, Jeremy completed his action to send a message [1] to the   URI list with our proposed test cases and results for the interpretations   of URI's within the scope of an xml:base.    There was some discussion of the application of xml:base to same document   references.    Al Gilman has replied [2]:    [[  So for RDF to apply the semantic constraint that a #fragment reference is   equivalent to a given absolute URI -- within a representation which belongs   to a type which by its type definition is bound to the constraints of the   RDF model -- is entirely within the purview of the specification of the RDF   model and the languages in which it is represented.  ]]    This view, I think, would give us license to translate a fragment id only   uri reference into an absolute uri.    Paul Grosso has replied [3]:    [[  ...  It is important that RDF and everyone  else realize that use of XML Base requires compliance with RFC 2396 which  requires that relative URI references consisting of just the fragment id  ignore any base URI and instead always refer to a fragment id within the  current document.  ]]    which says, we can't take into account xml:base in this calculation.    Both Al and Paul have suggested this is an architectural issue and should   be taken to the tag.    Larry Massiner has suggested defining some new syntax, e.g. a new pseudo   prefix to represent the current effective base URI, e.g. base:#foo.  He has   stated that there is no chance of getting a modification in to the proposed   update of RFC 2396 to deal with this problem, but suggested that a new   draft could be written [4].    Martin Deurst has pointed out (in a chat at WWW 2002) that RDF may be   embedded in other documents, e.g. HTML, or XML.  The mime types of such   documents will not be the RDF mime type, so any rdf specific processing of   fragments in such document will not apply.

        Hi Martin,    Thank you for this.  I'm sure it will be helpful in understanding your  point of view.    However, I note with some frustration, that after three weeks of  discussion, I still don't have a single use case illustrating  significant harm done to the cause of internationalization by RDFCore's  post last call decision.    As things stand, RDFCore has no case to answer.

That we could have  defined/adopted a different "value space" for XML.  We did, at one point  have something similar on the table; there was a suggestion that  parseType="Literal" should generate an RDF representation of the  infoset.  I can't remember why we dropped it - those brian (sic) cells  have gone.    I think we've got greater clarity now, so I can butt out again.    Brian

        I indicated last week my intention that the WG should decide on the   semantics of non-datatyped, i.e. old style, literals, at this weeks   telecon.  I ask for the WG's support in keeping to that schedule.    The decision we have to make is to choose whether literals of the form:       <rdf:Description>       <foo:age>10</foo:age>     </rdf:Description>    have tidy or untidy semantics, or indeed whether we are not saying one way   or the other.  Note: I like the terms introduced by Patrick, "value based   semantics" and "string based semantics".    This debate has raged for many months, with committed proponents of each   position arguing at length and failing to convince each other.  After all   this, I think we have to conclude that we have failed to find a decisive   flaw or advantage in either approach.  We have, in fact, to assume that we   have two self consistent positions and we must make a choice between them,   or choose not to decide.    I think it is the role of the chair to assist the WG to reach a   decision.  We have been stuck on this for ages.  In the light of this, I am   going to introduce a bias in the way I frame the decision.    I note that all of the implementations of RDF with which I am familiar have   implemented M&S with the assumption that literals have string semantics,   i.e. literal("foo").equals(literal("foo")).    Our charter is to clarify M&S, not to go rewriting it.  We have in the past   allowed ourselves some leeway in this regard, but we have set the bar   higher for justifying a "change" than for more straight forward clarifications.    If we are going to ask implementations to change to remain conformant, I   suggest the WG has a duty to justify that decision.  There must be a strong   and clear benefit from such a change and it must be one we can clearly   articulate to the developer community and expect them to support.    The issue here is not whether the developer community is willing to   change.  I expect the Jena team will implement what the WG decides as no   doubt will others.  But if the WG are going to ask folks to spend time and   money making these changes, it ought to have a good reason for doing so.    I am suggesting therefore that the default decision is that non-datatyped   literals have string based semantics (tidy) unless there is good reason to   change.  I invite those who advocate value based semantics (untidy) to   advance a rationale for such a change and we will determine at Fridays   telecon whether this convinces the WG.    I suggest that we have debated this issue to death and that further debate   is pointless.  We are at the stage where we need to summarize the argument   and have the WG decide whether it finds it convincing.  As chair, I could   try that summary myself, but I have decided that it would be best done by   the advocates themselves, though I'll try to help out if it looks like that   would be useful.    Brian    ps: summaries are short and clear        

      Attached is some work in progress on an RDF Schema for P3P.    It's still at the changing a lot stage.    Brian        application/xml attachment: p3p-rdf-schema.xml

Are there technical reasons why sss has to be legal for this   entailment.  Would it make sense that just be using ddd in that position in   a literal, one is asserting that its a datatype.  Of course one, might be   wrong; but that's not RDF's business.    Brian

Is dlex really necessary?    [[  Sometimes one wishes to associate a literal with a value without specifying   a particular datatype.  ]]    This does not seem to me be a strong need for this from the user's point of   view.  Does this need come from a technical requirement of the model theory?    I suppose this message comes down to:       o is dlex necessary       o if it is necessary for the model theory, can it be hidden in the model   theory and not exposed to the user.    Brian

      Thanks DanC for kicking this off an getting us started.    My name is Brian McBride and I've been technical staff in  HPLabs in Bristol, England for about 5 years.  I have a home  page http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/people/bwm/.    I've been working with RDF for about a year now.  I've built a  SQL based triple store and an implementation of the Jena Java  API for RDF, which can be found off my home page.    I've really enjoyed the discussions over technical issues with  RDF over the past year, but have been frustrated that we haven't  had the mechanism to officially resolve the issues that have  arisen.  So I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to   contribute to this working group.    We have some interesting challenges to address, which  include:      o making RDF easier to understand and more accessible to the      development community      o providing a specification with sufficient precision to support      the development of formal systems, such as those discussed on the      www-rdf-logic@w3.org mailing list.      o relating RDF to other XML standards such as XML      o resolving some hard technical problems    I'm looking forward to it.

        This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.  Please can I have any by   noon uk time Thursday please.    On my list of possibles I have:      o abstract syntax - I'd prefer a whole proposal rather than specific   questions      o semantics of untyped literals    Thats about it for now.    Brian        

        Peter has clarified [1] the status of some of the comments he has made   on the LC semantics document:    pfps-02 - translation to lbase - pfps notes the ball is in our court.    pfps-03 - translation to lbase - pfps just doesn't see the need for   lbase in the document    pfps-04 - rdf closure rules - pfps wants a stronger notion of   completeness of the closure rules    pfps-05 - rdfs closure rules - again pfps wants a stronger notion of   completeness of the the closure rules    pfps-06 - xml literals and LV - it is possible the latest docs fix this   and we have not pointed this out to pfps.

      Skippable.    Things have moved on a lot in datatyping since the last version of   this.  We have a new initiative for moving forward which is "where the   action is" on datatyping currently.  However, I think it best to do another   of these posts to capture the input received after V4.    -------------    An updated summary of the datatyping issues, as I currently understand them.    Overall Status:    If all the proposed withdrawls and Sergey's union trick for B1 are accepted   then the only can't live with left is Jeremy's on B8.    Changes:      o Propose withdraw B10 as its fixed by Pat's model theory.      o Sergey withdraws B5, but DanC is not convinced.      o Propose withdraw B4, all accept literals can be treated      as tidy for datatyping      o B1:  Sergey suggests union trick      o notes B10 also affects S-P and S-B.    Issue B1:  =========    status: proposed resolution    In S, if one wants to use both idiom A and idiom B, e.g.    <mary> <age> "10" .  <age> <rdfs:range> <xsd:integer.lex> .    and    <mary> <ageD> _:a .  _:a <xsd:integer.map> "10" .    two properties have to be used, <age> and <ageD>, in this example.    Sergey suggests that the range of <age> can be the UNION of   xsdr:integer.map and xsdr:integer.lex and xsdr:integer.val.    Patrick: are you satisfied?    Can't Live With: PatrickS      Issue B2: Multiple Lexical Representations of a data value  ==========================================================    status: agreed that S-A allows this and TDL does not.    S, idiom A, permits multiple lexical representations of a data value:    _:i <xsd:double> "10.1" .  _:i <xsd:double.de> "10,1" .      Issue B3: the self entailment issue  ===================================  status: Withdrawn in favour of B4:    From:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0410.html    [[I accept the reasoning above; it doesn't address my objection;  it' just shows that my example wasn't very good. Sergey's  example makes the point better:]]    B9 also added in response to Graham's request.      Issue B4 - TDL breaks existing code  ===================================    status: propose withdraw, literals are tidy    This is similar to B3. I've changed the example slightly from Sergey's.    Under TDL, consider the graph:    _:f <rdf:type> <film> .  _:f <dc:Title> (_, "10") .  <mary> <age> (_, "10").    Does not entail:    _:x <dc:Title> _:y .  _:z <age> _:y .    Literals are no longer pairs, so this is no longer true.    DanC: do you accept    Can't Live With: DanC      Issue B5: Storage Requirements  ===============================    status: DanC disputes    TDL requires significantly more storage to implement.      Issue B6: S requires 4 URI's be registered for each data type  =============================================================  S requires that for each datatype 4 URI's be registered  datatype  datatype.lex  datatype.val  datatype.map    Sergey: Do you agree this is the case? If not, how many URI's are required   to implement ALL the idioms of S and coexist in the same model.      Issue B7: Complexity  ====================    status: agreed    S has several ways of expressing the same thing. An RDF processor has to be   aware of them all. Supported by Jeremy's error cases message    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Jan/0397.html    and a message from Andy Seaborne to rdf comments:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2002JanMar/0058.html      Issue B8: S-B encourages logically (sic) errors in the  application type processing.  =======================================================    status: ?    Given:    _:f <rdf:type> <film> .  _:f <dc:Title> "10" .  <mary> <age> "10" .    an application 'knows' that the range of <age> is an integer so it 'knows'   that mary has <age> 10. Under S-B, running a query:    ?x <dc:Title> ?y .  ?z <age> ?y .    will return ?x = _:f and ?z = <mary>, and knowing that the age of <mary> is   10, may conclude that the title of the film is also 10.    Can't Live With: Jeremy      Issue B9: In TDL a document does not entail itself  ==================================================    status: Withdrawn.    Under TDL, does:    <foo> <dc:Title> "W3C" .    entail    <foo> <dc:Title> "W3C" .    yes.      Issue B10: Say what you mean  ============================    status: propose for withdrawl (Pat's model theory fixes)    The concern here is that in TDL, a literal denotes a pair consisting of a   value and a lexical representation of that value. The problem is then that   the german representation of floating point number, e.g. "10,5" is   different from the english representation, e.g. "10.5".    Thus under TDL a german 10 and a half is a different thing from an english   10 and a half.      More formally, under TDL:    <foo> <eg:size> _:s1 .  _:s1 <rdf:value> "10,5" .  _:s1 <rdf:type> <xsd:double-de> .    <bar> <eg:size> _:s2 .  _:s2 <rdf:value> "10.5" .  _:s2 <rdf:type> <xsd:double> .    does not entail:    <foo> <eg:size> _:s .  <bar> <eg:size> _:s .    Note that S-P and S-B have a similar problem.    Pat's new model theory addresses this.  In both TDL and S-P, the bNode   denotes something from the value space, not a pair.    Does anyone disagree.

      We have students coming to work with us and the plan is that they will work   on developing tools to support W3C process stuff;  basically daughter of Jema.    They will be led by one of our colleagues, Andy Seaborne, designer and   implementer of RDQL.  To get an understanding of what we do, Andy would   like to observe at the telecon tomorrow.

      I've done an updated version of the strawman model theory based on the   feedback so far:    Let U be the set of absolute URI References (as defined by RFC 2396).                                          //ignore lang and namespaces for now  Let S be the set of of ISO 10646 strings    An interpretation I of STATEMENTS, a set of statements   {s1, s2, ... ,sn} where each si is an n-triple statement,  consists of:    A set R of thingies    A subset P of thingies which corresponds to Properties    A mapping IN : U -> R    A mapping IEXT : P -> powerset(R x R)          // R cross R    A mapping IS : S -> R    Let STATEMENTS be a set {s1, s2, ..., sn} of n-triple statements    Let A be the set of names of the form _:name in STATEMENTS    STATEMENTS is true in I if and only if there is a substitution  mapping SUBST from the members of A to R such that each member   of STATEMENTS is true in I under that substition.    <s> <p> <o> .  is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if:       s, p, o are members of U, IN(p) is a member of P     (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p))    <s> <p> "string" . is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if:       s and p are members of U, IN(p) is a member of P      and string is a member of S     (IN(s), IS(string)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p))    _:name <p> <o> is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if:      p and o are members of U, IN(p) is a member of P and    (SUBST(_:name), IN(O)) is a member of IEXT(IN(p))    <s> _:name <o> is true in I under substitution SUBST if and only if:      s and o are members of U, SUBST(_:name) is a member of P and    (IN(s), IN(o)) is a member of IEXT(SUBST(_:name))       and similarly for anon nodes in other positions in the n-triple statement.

Firstly, with regard to the message Dan refers to:     >  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0200.html    this is a message from Martin, and not from I18N.  It would appear not   to have been endorsed by them and indeed contains:    [[  We discussed this issue shortly at the last i18n core teleconference,  but most people didn't feel they understood the issues enough.  ]]    I would not wish to appear to undermine the I18N case by including a   reference to 'formal objection' that says "we don't understand the issue   but ..."    Secondly, I am distinguishing in my mind between a statement that some   one does not accept a decision made by the WG and raising a formal   objection against it.  I find some support for this in the process   document, which appears to distinguish between an objection and a formal   objection, though I find the text unclear.    [[  When the Chair believes that the legitimate concerns of the dissenters   have received due consideration as far as is possible and reasonable,   then objections MUST be recorded and the group SHOULD move on.    A formal objection SHOULD include technical arguments and propose   changes that would remove the dissenter's objection; these proposals MAY   be vague or incomplete. The Chair MUST report an objection that includes   such information to the Director at later review stages (e.g., in the   request to the Director to advance a technical report to Candidate   Recommendation). If an objection does not include this information, the   Chair is NOT REQUIRED to report it at later review stages.  ]]   http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/policies.html#WGArchiveMinorityViews    Note the use of the term 'objection' in the first sentence, and 'formal   objection' in the second.    Thirdly, I note the message from Martin that DanC refers to does not   contain proposed changes.    My present inclinitation is to ask I18N whether they have decided to   raise a formal objection and if so, to refer us to publicly accessable   text describing their objection to which we can refer in the last call   announcement.  That would seem to resolve any ambiguity and gives I18N   the opportunity to clearly explain their concerns.    Brian

        Hi Pat,    I've been looking through the model theory doc; got about 2/3rds of the way   through before my concentration started to wane and I figured I better stop.    No critical problems.  I advise you not to read the attached review copy -   there is nothing there that needs immediate attention (in my judgement).    I marvel at your powers of telepathy.  I kept finding myself writing a   comment and then going back to remove it after I'd read a bit further.  I   left a few in to amuse you.    I think the only major concern I have is the lbase appendix, but that is   something we can discuss later.  I guess it comes down to my not   understanding why its there.  Occam says take it out and put in the lbase note.    You have done a fine job under considerable time pressure.  Thank you.    Brian        

        The RDFCore WG has me to forward the comments below on their behalf.  Other   comments, on behalf of RDFCore will be sent in separate messages.    Brian    ------------------------------    owlsas-rdfcore-np-complete    RDFCore notes the a consequence of the rules for owl:equivalentClass is  that distinguishing OWL DL from OWL Full has complexity NP complete and  suggests WEBONT investigate whether this complexity can be reduced.    We note from the RDF semantics document    [[  Specifications of such syntactically restricted semantic extensions MUST   include a specification of their syntactic conditions which are sufficient   to enable software to distinguish unambiguously those RDF graphs to which   the extended semantic conditions apply.  ]]     http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/    -------------------------------    owlsas-rdfcore-bnodes-restrictions    RDFCore are concerned that restrictions placed on b-nodes will limit the  applicability of OWL DL to an unnecessarily restricted subset of RDF  instance data, for which no such restrictions apply.    For example, consider the use case in:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0109.html    [[  If bNodes can only be used as the object of a single triple, they lose most  of their value as a construct in the language. As does rdf:nodeID for that  matter.    <Image>    <depicts>     <Person>       <mbox rdf:resource="mailto:danbri@w3.org"/>     </Person>  </Image>    <Group>    <member>     <Person>      <homepage rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/People/DanBri/"/>     </Person>    </member>  </Group>    ...is OK in OWL, but if we add in an rdf:nodeID on the two Person elements  to express that they serialize descriptions of the same (un-named) resource,  we're in trouble? Ouch. That breaks most of my uses of RDF, and a lot of  deployed FOAF documents.  ]]      Specifically we request, that in Owl DL and Owl lite:       a) that a b-node representing an individual may be the object of more  than one triple     b) that cycles of b-nodes representing individuals be allowed.    -------------------------------        

        Danbri and I have been discussing issue:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#vass-01    Its quite hard to get a crisp quote of the problem from the email thread   but I think the issue is that schema does not layer the same way as, say   UML, in that classes can be members of themselves and one can take a   subproperty of subPropertyOf or rdf:type.    I think we need to clearly articulate the advantages of the design choice   that has been made.    I suggest the following reason for the design choice and why we should not   change.  I welcome comments and other suggestions:    1) RDFS is designed to be a lower layer for the semantic web stack that is   extended by restriction.  All structure at this layer is imposed on all   higher layers.  A layered structure is not necessary and the principle of   minimal restriction suggests it should be omitted.    2) A further consideration is the cost of change at this point.  To switch   to a layered approach would require a massive rethink and would affect not   only the RDFCore specs but also OWL.  Only a show stopping problem with the   current design could justify the cost of such a change.    We note that it is possible to build more strictly layered languages on top   of RDF(S), Owl DL/Lite being examples.    Brian

Brian, can you advise?    I don't remember what we agreed.  I'd don't like having Rdf depend on   something inthe RDFS namespace either.    Does anyone have any objections to putting this in the RDF namespace.  We   already have new names in there to cope with collections.

Patrick,    May I test my understanding of what you mean here.  I offer two datatype   definitions and an entailment.    Datatype Definition 1:    URI:           http://example.org/datatypes#1  Lexical Space: {"1"}  Values  Space: {1}  Mapping:       {"1", 1}  Comment:       The value space of this datatype is the set containing only   the integer 1.    Datatype Definition 2:    URI:           http://example.org/datatypes#2  Lexical Space: {"one"}  Values  Space: {1}  Mapping:       {"one", 1}  Comment:       The value space of this datatype is the set containing only   the integer 1.    Does:    <a> <b> "1"^^http://example.org/datatypes#1 .  <c> <d> "one"^^http://example.org/datatypes#2 .    entail    <a> <b> _:v .  <c> <d> _:v .    The point of this test is that whilst it is true that:    http://example.org/datatypes#1 rdfs:subClassOf http://example.org/datatypes#2 .  http://example.org/datatypes#2 rdfs:subClassOf http://example.org/datatypes#1 .    this is not explicitly stated in the definitions of the datatypes.

I think its a mandatory courtesy to   help those who have reviewed an earlier draft in detail, unless the changes   are such that a complete re-read is necessary.

      Hi Dave,    Good proposal.  Like the use of test cases.    When you said:     >   <Description xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"  >                about="http://example.org/">    did you mean:       >   <Description xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"                   ^^^^^  >                about="http://example.org/">    Regarding handling non-syntactic properties, I'd suggest that whatever  we  do, we do it consistently.    One thing to note is that the current grammar specifies that syntactic  attributes can always be unqualified.  If we are going to change that  we should check what, if anything will break and perhaps we should  deprecate rather than immediately outlaw.    I've written up some test cases as an XML file (text at the end of this  message in lieu of getting a directory set up to hold test cases), and  run them through the parsers I have access to.    RDFFilter basically regards unqualified attributes as being in the same   namespace as the element containing them.    The online SiRPAC accepts qualified attributes.  It will accept  unqualified  syntactic attributes in elements in the RDF namespace.    The online SWI-Prolog RDF parser interprets unqualified attributes as  being  in the namespace of the containing element.  Unlike RDFFilter it doesn't  barf on names in the RDF namespace it doesn't recognise.    Cara too is like RDFFilter, treating all unqualified attributes as  belonging  to the namespace of the enclosing element, except it silently drops  properties  in the RDF namespace it doesn't recognise.

Having an entry in the glossay seems like a good idea, though I personally  haven't tended to think of RDF processsors as being confined to operating  at the syntax level.  Did you have a specific syntax in mind?    I'm not sure that modifying the M&S text is that useful until   we get to drafting the whatever replaces the model bits of M&S.  I suggest that I add this to the list of editorial comments on M&S and  we can then deal with it at the appropriate time.  Does that work for you?    Brian

I wasn't shying away from it, I was trying to avoid a last call dependency   on it.    However, you are pretty serious about this.    It seems to me that what we need, as well as test cases, is an RDF Schema   for XML Schema datatypes.  If we are going to expect an xsd datatypes aware   processor to be aware of the class hierarchy, someone should write down   definitively what it is.    DanC, would you be willing to take an action to:       1 write an RDF Schema for XSD datatypes     2 Define a set of test cases to illustrate that schema and the datatype   entailment rules     3 Verify that RDF Schema and the test cases with the XML Schema folks     4 Bring the schema and test cases back to RDFCore for review    Brian

My concern is to determine whether RDFCore can move to a   second last call immediately.  It doesn't seem like a good idea to do a   second last call with the current ed's drafts then make substantive   changes as the result of last call comments on that and then have to do   a third last call.  Before doing a second last call we should ensure   that RDFCore have considered all the comments I18N would like to make.    Brian        

        I've just updated the disposition of lc2 comments document [1]    There is a bit of tidying up to be done:       - I've posted an attempt to close comments arising from Herman's   review of semantics     - DanC has the action to respond to I18N comments    However, that still leaves 5 comments on TestCases and one on primer   needing a response.

      I've been asked for an estimate of how many will attend our F2F meeting during   the tech plenary.  Please could you reply to this message indicating:       o whether you expect to attend the RDFCore F2F meeting at this event     o whether you expect to attend the plenary day at this event    This is for estimating; its not a commitment.

      Issue       http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdf-equivalent-representations    [Equivalence]: There are four RDF model "flavours" (formal/data model,   graph(ical) model, serialization syntax, triple). To what extend (precisely) are   these models (not) equivalent? (Problems related to anonymity have been   discussed, see also below, details need to be summarized). Could trying to find   transformation grammars be a solution (preciseness, determination of   equivalence)? Shouldn't this be in a "formal" part of M&S spec?    Propose that       o The WG believes that:          - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory        - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph        - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model          and Syntax document        are all equivalent.       o The WG notes that the RDF/XML syntax as currently defined is unable       to represent an arbritary RDF graph.  In particular, the RDF/XML syntax       cannot fully represent a bNode which is the object of more than one       statement.       o The WG believes that extending the RDF/XML syntax so that it can respresent       all RDF graphs is beyond the scope of its current charter and resolves       to postpone consideration of this issue.       o The WG actions the editor of the RDF Syntax WD to include in that       document a clear statement of the RDF graph structures that RDF/XML is       unable to represent.

        Stuart,    I'm afraid, despite the TAG allowing ample time for review, that RDFCore   will be late submitting comments on the architecture document.

      Art, Jos,    Thanks Jos.    I guess this sort of test case does not fit the "here's the RDF/XML, this  is what it means in n-triples" pattern very well, which seems to suggest  we need a new pattern for defining schema test cases.    Did you guys have something in mind?

          Pat Hayes wrote:      >> Brian/Pat - were does the WG stand on duplicate triples?      Actually, I'm not sure :(    Let me try a strawman position:    I agree with Pat that this seems to be more of an implementation issue which is   hard to discuss without a processing model.  However, using terms like parser,   loosely:       o it doesn't seem reasonable to require parsers to eliminate duplicates -   that  would prohibit the development of streaming parsers.       o we need say nothing this in terms of representing an RDF graph - it's up to   the implementor whether they filter duplicates or not.  that way we don't break   existing implementations of either family for no good reason.       o Pat seems to reckon the model theory is simpler with a set.  Can we extend   the notion of a tidy graph so that it removes duplicate statements.  Any untidy   graph has an equivalent tidy graph, and the model theory is defined in terms of   that.    Brian        

      Now that we have got a partition of the problem space, I would like to see  us moving forward on the issues we have in the lower layers.    A core of our work is going to be a simple representation of an RDF graph.  We  need a simple language for unambiguously expressing an RDF graph.  We can  then define the meaning of other RDF languages, such as RDF/XML as a transform  to this simple language.    We have such a language already.  It is n-triple.    We also need to define the semantics of RDF, and since we already have  n-triple, it seems simpler, less work and clearer to define the semantics  of n-triple rather than use something different.    n-triple was conceived for the purpose of writing test cases.  As such, I  think it represents the intuitions of at least some of us, of what needs  to be represented in the lowest layers of RDF.  However, we haven't  up till now considered it as the basis for the core definition of RDF.  We have issues with it that remain to be resolved.  These are:      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-graph      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xmllang      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure    I would therefore like to activate these issues, and to reflect the decisions  we make in update to the specification of n-triple.  I'd like some volunteers  to own these.    Graham, you have made a proposal for an absract syntax and semantics.  I am  assuming that you feel pretty neutral about the actual concrete form of   the syntax and that n-triple can represent everything you need at the  syntactic level.  If that is so, then we can focus on the question of  reification on the semantics rather than the syntax.    Yesterday we also activated      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-identity-anon-resources    I think this is more of a semantic question, but it does affect the syntax  of n-triple.  I'd also like a volunteer to own this one.    Having got the syntax of n-triple agreed, we can then move swiftly on to  address its semantics.  I remain hopeful that we can resolve both the syntax  and semantics questions by the end of the face to face.    Brian        

      I suppose I think of this a bit differently.    The way I see it we are discussing two things here:       1.  when two literals are equal from the point of view of the model         theory       2.  the matching algorithm an application might use when it does         a query or other operation on an RDF model    The inclusion of f* mixes these up.    As I see it, the specs we are writing define equality for the model  theory.   We are not defining application behaviour.    In which case all f* are actually f.  That is of course,  unless we want to and can persuade Pat to move to a logic  which distinguishes between 'should be' and 'must be'.  (only joking, Pat :)    An application may choose any matching that is appropriate for that  application;  I'm told that Geordie's can have a good guess at  what some Norwegian means, but I don't think we should build that  sort of thing into our specs.

        My take on this:    The namespace       http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#    is controlled by W3C.

Right.  Now I see what you are getting at.  This is:      http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-literals-as-resources    Creative interpretations aside, this is a change to the model  described in m&s, but it is a pure simplification in that it removes  something from the abstract syntax and changes nothing of the   interpretation of what is left.  If it can be made to work, then  any model according to the more common interpretation of M&S would  be isomorphic with one using data uri's.    So on the procedural question, I'm persuaded - we should consider this  one.  Is anyone willing to write up a proposal?  It will need to cover  questions like, given a literal - what exactly is the uri a parser should  produce, questions of equality and equivalence (is <data:text/xml;A> the  same as <data:text/plain;A>, effects on implementations (do they have  to allow for larger URI's?)

I fear I haven't got this right in   what I wrote, and I fear even more to get into model theory, however,   what if:       "2<3" denotes "2<3" in all interpretations.    Now I have a problem with what does       "<br></br>" denote.   Given the above, it can't be the xsd:string,   underminging something I wrote earlier.  Martin previously suggested it   might denote something like  seq(markup("<br>"), markup("</br>")).    I was trying to avoid getting into defining a new value space for   literals to allow for distinguishing markup, hence the attempt to keep   the denotation as strings.  I think I'm beginning to see that does not work.    Regarding not conceding this point to Martin, I think where Martin is   coming from is something like the following view:      - simple sequences of characters are sufficient to represent all   expressions in common western languages, but not in all languages.      - where simple sequences of characters are allowed in formal   languages, such as programming languages and the like they are   sufficient to represent expressions in common western languages but not   in all languages.  This represents discrimination by the dominant   technical community against non-western languages.      - to avoid such discrimination, wherever simple sequences of   characters are allowed in a formal language, xml markup should be   allowed so that expressions in other languages are also permitted.

        I noticed that closure rule rdf2 in      http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-mt-20030117/#rdf_entail    will generate an infinite number of triples from any triple with an xml  literal as its object.

We need to be clear which is the tail and which is the dog here.    The role of the formal model is precisely define/explain the  intended semantics of RDF.  We choose the semantics - the logicians  figure out how to express it.

Is that true, which I suppose means "what exactly do you mean by that?"    For example, in proposal S, if I define the domain of say xsd:integer to be   foo:integer and rdfs can conclude that any bNode with an xsd:integer property   hanging of it is an integer.    Similarly, in the S proposal, would not xsd:byte be a subProperty of xsd:short   which is a subProperty of ...      > They can all be   > straightforwardly handled in RDF/XML.  >   >   > The S and CD proposals require that users conform to a given 'idiom',   > and are often incompatible with current common usage in which literals   > are used to refer to things other than strings;      I know what you mean here, but I object to the term incompatible.  Current RDF   does not do anything about datatypes.  In one interpretation all literals denote   strings, and if I have a property with value "10", then that's just fine.  An   application can 'know' that it should interpret that as an integer.  With for   example, the X and S and DC proposals they can continue to do so.  The datatype   information is simply not represented in the RDF model; its encoded in the   definition of the property.  This doesn't seem to me to any different from, say   the property weightInKg which takes a P++ representation of an integer implying   that units are kilograms, not pounds.

        Well, the overnight developments I had hoped for aren't going to happen.    First a context setting ramble, than two concrete suggestions.    I believe that it is Peter's intention to formally object to the current     RDF handling of normal form C.    I feel I don't really understand the issue very well, but I'll try to   summarize my understanding, such as it is.  Please correct my   misunderstanings.    RDFCore is following CharMod and I18N advice in requiring literals to be     in normal form C.  XML 1.0 and XSD datatypes do not require this.   Thus there are legal fragments of XML 1.0 that are not in normal form C,   legal xsd:string's that are not in normal form C and legal xsd:anyURI's   that are not in normal form C and these cannot be used in an RDF graph.    I think that the issue arises rarely in practice, e.g. when a string or   xml fragment contains a combining character with nothing to combine with.    One issue of concern to Peter is that the current specs prohibit us   saying in say Owl that some string (which is not in normal form C) is   not in normal form C.  I think this is wrong, in that it is possible to   invent a datatype whose lexical space consists of strings in normal form   C, but whose value space is not, that would allow the representation of   all strings.  The same could be done for XML fragments, though would   then loose the benefit of the parseType="Literal" convenience syntax.  Thus whilst the RDF specs would not be providing a standard way of   representing non-NFC strings, it would not be preventing their expression.    That said, it does seem odd to me that we are precluding RDF from   representing some legal fragments of XML 1.0 as XML Literals.  Please   interpret "odd" as massive English understatement.    This situation has arisen because we have been striving to be good   citizens, especially with respect to internationalization and have   adopted good practice earlier than some other specs.  This does not play   well when we embed fragments of language conforming to those other specs   in our language.  This is a situation when one has to consider the   wisdom of trying to be "ahead of the pack".    I am tempted by an idea I will attribute to pfps, though I'm not sure he   is advocating it, that we should report these difficulties we have   encountered trying to deploy charmod to I18N and seek their advice on   managing the transition, specifically given that we embed fragments of   non-conforming languages in ours.    I also wonder whether this issue might be addressed by toning down the   language from MUST to SHOULD e.g.    [...]    > which includes the additional following para:  >   > [[  > The string in both plain and typed literals is required to  > be in Unicode Normal Form C [NFC]. This requirement is motivated  > by [Charmod] particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization.  > ]]    becomes something like    [[  The string in both plain and typed literals SHOULD be in Unicode Normal   Form C [NFC].  This is motivated by anticipation that [Charmod],   particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization will become   standardized practice.  Implementations SHOULD accept strings which are   not in Normal Form C and MAY issue a warning in such circumstances.  ]]    Brian

        Folks,    I've been working with Danbri an update to the schema doc.  The latest   version is at:       http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/Schema/200212bwm/    which I hope is pretty close to a last call candidate.  One issue I'm aware   of is that there are a lot of missing spaces.  Turns out Amaya seems to   regard whitespace as optional - I've put them all back in once.  Now I'm   leaving it to the end to fix that.    Anyway, if anyone is getting bored over the holidays, feedback would be   appreciated.    Brian

That seems to suggest that you will have to change this data anyway to be   conformant.  Would it be feasible to change it use a b-node while you are   at it?       some:Resource mars:shortLabel _:v .     _:v  rdf:value mars:Token"Foo" .     _:v  mars:lang "en" .    or some such construct?      >We need the language classification in order to differentiate  >between different language variants, and we also need the  >datatype to constrain values to valid tokens.

From a Nokia point of view I can see that changing the code is   undesirable.  But from a more global  point of view, is it something that   perhaps Nokia should be willing to do in order to preserve conformance with   the xml schema datatypes model.  I would have thought that was something   Nokia would also like to preserve.      >Alternately, we could use reification and qualify each statement  >for language, but again, that is a very heavy solution and  >grossly redundant.

Transforming legacy is always a pain.  To some extent its unavoidable given   a 'clarification' of the spec.

      We still have to decide what to do about the RDFCore deliverable:           * provide an account of the relationship between RDF and the XML   family of technologies (particularly Schemas and Infoset/Query)    We need to figure out if/how we meet this deliverable.

The way I was looking at it, was that removing the 'MUST NOT' was removing  constraints on the behaviour of an RDF processor.  That doesn't prevent us  having examples that are not legal RDF.

Hi Paul,    It may be that this needs to go the tag, but I'd like to make sure we do   our best to clarify the issue first.  I hope Jeremy will forgive me butting in.    I'll try to keep this short, but it may be a little long.    First: the problem RDF is trying to solve.  The current RDF specs have   encouraged the use of the following idiom:       <rdf:Description rdf:about="#foo">       ...    The value of the rdf:about attribute is turned into an absolute URI   reference by concatenating the '#foo' with the URI of the containing document.    This causes problems.  Folks copy the file from the web to their hard drive   so they can work on it in a plane, and the uri changes to something like   file:c:\temp\....rdf and this is really useless for rdf users.  Or folks   wish to include RDF in say a message protocol where  there is no base uri   of the document.  This is the cause of one of, if not the, most frequent newbie problem with   DAML that we see on jena-dev.    So we are looking for a way to retain this convenient syntax, but have the   uri's produced not change when the file is copied or mirrored.    To appreciate what is happening here, we need to look at a semi-fictional   RDF processing pipeline:      input xml document -> xml parser -> rfc2396 processor -> rdf parser -> rdf   graph    We start with an xml document and end up with a datastructure.  The   datastructure is not a DOM; its not a representation of an xml   document.  It is as far as xml is concerned, an application data structure.    For each value of an rdf:about attribute, the rfc2396 processor outputs   either an absolute URI or a same document reference.  The absolute URI is   processed according to RFC2396.  Same document references are recognised   according to RFC 2396.    All is in conformance with rfc 2396 at this point.    Now the RDF parser comes in to play and it is required to transform the   value of each rdf:about attribute into an absolute uri reference.  If the   RFC 2396 processor has produced an absolute uri reference, it need do   nothing.  If however, it is a same document reference, then, just as a   browser will handle same document references specially, so does RDF.  It   transforms the same document reference into an absolute URI according to an   algorithm defined by the RDF specs.  The mimetype of an rdf document will   be text/xml+rdf.  As far as xml base and rfc 2396 are concerned, this is   application code over which they have no say.    What I have tried to do here is to position RDF as an application built on   top of XML and to suggest that XML should not be allowed to express   constraints on how applications process it.    There is a deal of sophistry in this argument :( but RFC 2396 doesn't   really meet our needs.  Are there any plans to update/refine it in the near   future?    Brian        

        I've created a directory TR under RDFCore in the cvs structure.  It contains:       WD-rdf-concepts-20030117     WD-rdf-mt-20030117     ...    for building the last call docs.    The root of each doc should be called       Overview.html    Editors with CVS access please feel free to populate.  If this works then   I'll point the ed's working drafts at these pages.    Please report status as you update.    Eric/Danbri - please can you make sure these are publicly visible.  I   haven't put in a readme of any form - feel free to add if we should have one.    Brian        

      Jeremy,    I came across this in some RDF Stuart has written:    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/"                    xml:base="http://example/org/base/">     <rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal">       <a href="foo">link</a>     </rdf:value>  </rdf:Description>    I wasn't sure whether the xml:base had any effect on the href.

I think that puts the question nicely Frank.      I am assuming an editor can ask the WG to consider any comment raised, so   the editor can push anything on to the WG.    The question in my mind is, how much does the WG wish to be involved and   how much would it prefer the editors to just handle on their own.  The   point of the discussion in todays telecon is to ask the WG this   question.  I think possible answers include:       o the WG reviews all changes     o editors have freedom to fix trivial changes (typos, links, formatting,   grammar), but the WG would like to review all other changes     o the WG would like to review all comments, but may decide the issue is   editorial and then leave it to the editor to fix     o the WG would like to leave it entirely to the editors judgement of   when to consult the WG.    Brian        

        The discussion at Friday's telecon reminded me why I was keen to have test   case A still in.  I've tried to raise this point a couple of times and just   wanted to put it more formally.    It is suggested that, even with untidy literals:       _:a <p> "lit" .     _:b <p> "lit" .    entails:       _:a <p> _:l .     _:b <p> _:l .    Consider a statement and its reification:       <s> <p> "a" .                       (1)     _:s rdf:subject <s> .     _:s rdf:predicate <p> .     _:s rdf:object "a" .                (2)     _s: rdf:type rdf:Statement.    Does the object of statement (1) denote the same thing as the object of   statement (2)?    Given the model theory as it stands (Pat - is this right?) the answer to   this question is yes.    Now consider:       <jenny> foo:age "10" .                   (3)     <film>  dc:title "10" .                  (4)     foo:age  rdfs:range xsdr:decimal .     dc:title rdfs:range xsdr:string .    and two reifications:       _:a rdf:subject <jenny> .     _:a rdf:predicate foo:age .     _:a rdf:object "10" .                    (5)     _:a rdf:type rdf:Statement .       _:b rdf:subject <film> .     _:b rdf:predicate dc:title .     _:b rdf:object "10" .                    (6)     _:b rdf:type rdf:Statement .      Then the objects of statements (5) and (6) cannot denote the same thing as   the objects of statements (3) and (4) respectively.    I confess I find this rather bizarre.  In the case where the object of a   statement is a literal, then the value of the rdf:object property of the   reification of that statement denotes a syntactic entity, otherwise it   denotes a semantic one.  (Sorry that doesn't sense to a logician, but Pat'l   know what I mean.)    Is that what we mean to say?    If the answer to test case A is yes, then we need an non-entailment test:       <s> <p> "a" .     _:s rdf:subject <s> .     _:s rdf:predicate <p> .     _:s rdf:object "a" .     _s: rdf:type rdf:Statement .    where _:s is a reification of the first statement    does not entail:       <s> <p> _:o .     _:s rdf:object _:o .

It may be a little old maidish of me, but one of the virtues this WG has,   in my view, been the respect in which members hold each other and each   others views.    I'm sure this was meant in a jokey way, but I'd like to take the   opportunity to remind folks that's not the sort of language we have   typically used around here.    Brian        

        Cluck. Cluck. Cluck.    Pat, please hold that thought.  Right now I'm trying to encourage the WG to   get the datatyped literals sorted out and then we can come back to looking   at the other sort.

        As I said earlier, with the aim of building stronger consensus around the   tidy/untidy decision, I've been through the submissions last week in   support of untidy literal semantics and I've tried to summarize my   understanding of them here.  There are some editorial comments   intertwined.  Feel free, to send suggestions/corrections.        1.  Ease of Use for the Content Producer  ----------------------------------------    Untidy semantics permit long range datatyping whilst maintaining   monotonicity.  Tidy semantics does not.    With untidy semantics, a writer of RDF/XML can specify a range constraint   on a property to imply the datatype of the value of the property.    With tidy semantics, to maintain monotonicity, the datatype must be   specified syntactically and the only way we currently have to do that is to   put an rdf:datatype attribute on each property element that represents a   datatyped value.    [Ed note:  This argument would be strengthened if we had specific examples   where the burden of adding the datatype attributes was a problem, Owl for   example?  ]      2.  Principle of Least Change  -----------------------------    For the RDF Content Creator:    Some RDF assumes string based semantics for literals.  [There ought to be a   reference here, perhaps something from RSS or FOAF?]  Some RDF is written   as if literals had value based semantics.  [Reference CC/PP bitsPerPixel?]    They both look the same in RDF/XML, e.g.       <rdf:Description>       <foo:bar>10</foo:bar>     </rdf:Description>    There is no way to tell from this alone whether the string "10" is meant or   the integer 10.    If a generic RDF processor is to know which, then it must be told   somehow.  With untidy semantics, this can be done with a range constraint   in a schema to define the type of the literal.  This is considerably more   convenient for the content producer.  With tidy semantics the content   itself must be modified to indicate the actual datatype.    For the content producer therefore, the least change is to have untidy   literals and range constraints.    [Ed Note:    1) This part of the argument is based on the desire to add datatype   information to existing content so that the datatype is understood by an   RDF processor.  The least change is actually to do nothing, when the world   is no worse off than it is now.  But if it is thought that it is important   to capture this datatype information in legacy content, then untidy   semantics are the easiest path for the content producer.    2) As expressed, this argument does not address the tradeoff that   exists.  Whilst adopting untidy semantics makes it easier to specify that a   literal really denotes an integer, it adds a burden of requiring the   content producer to specify that strings were intended, where that would   not be necessary with tidy semantics.  It could be, depending on the   distribution of data, that its more work to have to add the range   constraints on all the literals that are really strings than it is to add   the range constraints for other datatypes.  We did ask the community which   they preferred and they said untidy - see below.    3) This argument would carry greater force if:       o we can establish there are a lot of examples where adding this   datatype information is desirable       o there are important examples where adding this datatype information is   necessary (DAML+OIL?)  ]    For the generic tool developer, the principal of least change suggests   doing what is currently done.  The tools we currently know about (cwm,   euler, redland and jena) implement tidy semantics.    Overall, it is easier to change a few tools than a lot of content and some   other specifications.      3.  The user community asked for untidy  ---------------------------------------    We asked the user community, as clearly as we could, about the tradeoff   between tidy and untidy semantics.  There was a clear signal from those who   responded, that indicated a preference for untidy semantics.      4. Abbreviated Syntax  ---------------------  [Ed note:  I've added this one, as I was reminded of it whilst writing the   above]    With tidy semantics, it is not possible to represent datatyped values using   property attributes in the abbreviated syntax.  Thus it is not possible to   embed in html, rdf which represents datatyped values without the browser   rendering it.

      With respect to action:      AP: 2001-06-08#3: Brian McBride: pick up on the syntax issues now the          model details have been clarified.    from last weeks teleconference, I would like to propose the attached   McBride/Beckett proposal for parsing containers.  This proposal was circulated  on RDF Interest in December 2000       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2000Dec/0082.html    and has been received positively.    Feedback at the time this proposal was originally circulated suggested that  the interpretation of rdf:li as an attribute should be modified, e.g. in:      <rdf:Bag rdf:li="foo"/>    There have been two proposals:      o disallow rdf:li as an attribute      o define rdf:li as an attribute to always translate to rdf:_1.    I suggest that rdf:li be disallowed as an attribute.    Another weakness of the original proposal is that it is not clear what  tripes to generate for the following case:      <rdf:Bag rdf:_1="1", rdf:_2="2"/>      <rdf:li>?</rdf:li>    </rdf:Bag>    That said, if the WG raises no objections to the general thrust of the proposal,  I will create a fuller set of test cases.    Brian

As expressed, I would agree with that sentiment; its hard for me to accept   that the idiosyncracies of a particular programming language should have   much to do with what we do.    However, I think the real issue here is not about programming languages,   its about representing closure.  I think (DanC please confirm, you raised   this), that the question is "How do I represent the fact that there are no   more members of this container after rdf:_nnn".    I rather like your end marker technique Pat.    Brian

Nice idea.  Basically this would allow easy compare of models that  came from the same RDF/XML serialization.    One thing it wouldn't handle is the following example:     <rdf:Description>    <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>   </rdf:Description>   <rdf:Description>    <bar:foo>barfoo</bar:foo>   </rdf:Description>    compared to:     <rdf:Description>    <bar:foo>barfoo</bar:foo>   </rdf:Description>   <rdf:Description>    <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>   </rdf:Description>    These are representations of equivalent graphs which graph compare  will find equivalent.    What about:      <rdf:Description>      <foo:type rdf:about="http://foo#Class">      <foo:bar>        <rdf:Desription/>      </foo:bar>    </rdf:Description>    and      <foo:Class>      <foo:bar>        <rdf:Description/>      </foo:bar>    </foo:Class>    If they are to compare equivalent, the element number cannot be used.    This approach would also seem to imply that the ordering of the RDF/XML  is significant.  So if two processors were to have an internal  representation of the same model, would they have to write it out in  the same order to ensure that the RDF/XML produced compared equal.  If so, we are back into the complexities of graph theory.    Brian

Good to be thinking about this and collecting data.  A couple of suggestions:       o don't do too much work on it till we datatypes fully nailed; some   issues did surface at the f2f.

That is reopening an old issue where I believe we have already decided the   value of the reification properties do not denote the syntax.    Are you suggesting this treatment be special for rdf:object?  Just when it   takes a literal value?    Brian

By go round the table, I mean to solicit the views of each   member of the WG, without initiating a debate on members views.  We can   then summarize those views and deal with issues arising.

      ACTION: 2001-11-16#7 Pat following email discussion of   rdfms-boolean-valued-properties, prepare new statement of this resolution   to bring back for approval.    We discussed boolean valued properties on 16/11 telecon and agreed in   principal that this could be handled using rdf:type, but some wordsmithing  on the resolution was needed.    Pat and I (well Pat did it really, I'm just trying to steal some of the   credit) have worked up the following resolution to close this issue:       o. The WG notes that since a boolean-valued property can be        identified with a     class, rdf:type can be used to        represent boolean valued properties. Thus:         <foo> <chocolateLover> <true> .    can be represented by         <foo> <rdf:type> <ChocolateLover> .       o. While this provides no way to express a negative (negated)        boolean value, the addition of such an ability would extend        RDF beyond its anticipated semantic basis, requiring        unacceptably far-reaching changes.       o. The WG resolves to close this issue on the grounds that the        current facilities are adequate for all purposes that do not        over-extend RDF.    Brian

        With respect to:    2002-08-23#6  bwm  Ensure that WG home page points to current editor   working draft documents for WG review     From my perspective, I don't want to have to keep updating this page, so   I'd like a stable URI for the ed's working draft of each document.    The current status is:      Primer:    The ed's working draft for the primer pointed to       http://www.w3.org/2001/09/rdfprimer/    This however, is a directory with many files in it.  Frank/Eric: do you   want to leave it like this or would you prefer to have a link the latest   actual doc, and if so, can you provide a URL for it (or set the directory   contents up so that it default to the current version).    Concepts and Abstract Data Model:    Please can the editors of the Concepts and Abstact Data Model provide a   stable uri for the ed's wd.    Syntax:    The eds wd points to http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/    Model Theory    Pat, please could you provide a stable URI for the ed's wd.    Test Cases:    Ed's wd points to http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/    Datatypes:    At present, no links.    If folks can let me have the url's I'll fill in the links.    Brian        

      Lets imagine we have a simple example where we have resources of type Foobar   that have a unique property size which is an integer.    The use case is to:       o merge two graphs using different lexical representations of an int      Approach 1: concrete types are represented by literals which are a pair   consisting of a type and a lexical representation, the result of a dumb merge is:    _:foobar rdf:type util:Foobar .  _:foobar util:size xsd:int-"10" .  _:foobar util:size xsd:int-"010" .    Unless the software is smart enough to understand that "05" and "5" denote the   same integer, this is pretty unsatisfactory, since there really is only one size   property.    Conclusion: require a canonical representation of integers, or sw has to   understnad how to process the the xsd:int type.    Approach 2: the DAML+OIL approach - a dumb merge results in:    _:foobar rdf:type  util:Foobar .  _:foobar rdf:size  _:size1 .  _:size1   rdf:type  xsd:int .  _:size1   rdf:value "10" .  _:size2   rdf:type  xsd:int .  _:size2   rdf:value "010" .    Smart sw can recognise that size1 and size2 are really the same thing.  I'm   worried though, that that doing that will call for a compare against all anon   resources in the graph.  If I'm adding _:size2 to the graph, would I be able to   restrict the sw attention to checking only whether it was equal to size1.  Yes,   it could; it need only consider arcs with the same blunt end and property.    Conclusion: Same as 1; to do the merge properly require either a canonical   representation of ints, or the software has to understand ints their lexical   representation.  Takes more triples this way.  Assert without proof, that this   is harder to implement than approach 1, since it involves multiple triples.    Approach 3: DanC's approach    _:foobar rdf:type      util:Foobar .  _:foobar util:size     "10" .  _:foobar util:intSize  _:size1 .  _:size1  rdf:type      xsd:int .  _:size1  rdf:value     "10" .  _:foobar util.intSize  _:size2 .  _:size2  rdf:type      xsd:int .  _:size2  rdf:value     "010" .    Conclusion: same as approach 2.    Approach 4: Pat's approach (?)    _:foobar      rdf:type    util:Foobar .  _:foobar      util:size   size1:"10" .  _:size1:"10"  rdf:type    xsd:int .  _:foobar      util:size   size2:"010" .  _:size2:"010" rdf:type    xsd:int .    Software that's aware of how to process lexical representations of int's reduces   this to three triples.  Less triple bloat than above.  Debatably extends M&S's   model, but compatible with with current RDF in that types added as an extension.  Worry about DAML+OIL requirement that concrete types and resources are disjoint.     Specifically, rdf:type in above is illegal in DAML+OIL; no property can have a   both a resource and a concrete type in its domain.    I guess what's botherimg me here is RDF's ability to separate out individual   statements and if the original set was true, they should be true independently.  So    _:foobar      util:size   size1:"10" .    Is this really true?  is it the same as:    _:foobar      util:size   "10" .    The value of the size should be an integer, shouldn't it.      There may be other approaches I should cover; sorry I'm running out of time and   patience(as probably are you).         o query a graph where the graph and the query contain different lexical   representations of an int.    It seems to me that its likely that implementations will want to store a   canonical representation of an int, and will convert the query to that canonical   representation.  So this isn't a problem.  What bothers me though, is, if the   the graph implementation reads in a representation of an int as say from "010"   but changes it intenally to some canonical representation which loses the fact   it was originally represented as "010", have we lost anything?  Is there any   distinction amongst the different approaches.    So if I've got:    _:foobar rdf:type  util:Foobar .  _:foobar rdf:size  _:size1 .  _:size1   rdf:type  xsd:int .  _:size1   rdf:value "10" .  _:size2   rdf:type  xsd:int .  _:size2   rdf:value "010" .         o query a graph for all Foobar's whose size is less than 12.    In a large scale database, it would be crazy, from an implementation point of   view, not to store the underlying data in a way that represented the ordering of   integers so that the query can be done efficiently.  This implies using an   internal canonical representation.    I'm left with the feeling that representing a concrete type as a pair will be   easier to implement.  Your milage may vary.

[[The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments in an   RDF document.]]    Is that true?  Hmmm, we said rdf:ID="foo" was equivalent to   rdf:about="#foo".  Does rdf:ID actually define a fragment in the   document?  Did we mean that to happen with rdf:about too?    I'd like to see two things:       o an overview of the ietf process, preferably from someone who has done   this before.  Are we cooked to start this?       o Your current draft copied to an archive and review by at least two   members of the WG.  If we can get volunteers asap, I can put it on the   agenda for approval this Friday.    Brian        

      Sorry folks - hit the wrong key.  The first phone conference is on the  27th April 2001.  The announcement should have read:    RDFCore WG members,    The first phone conference of the RDF Core group will take place on  Friday 27th April 2001 at:      10:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in America/New_York    15:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in Europe/London    22:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in Asia/Hong Kong    23:00:00 Fri Apr 20 2001 in Asia/Tokyo    00:00:00 Sat Apr 21 2001 in Australia/Sydney    Please note this is a change from the date on the web site and is  the Friday immediately before WWW10 in Hong Kong.  Please inform the  chairs if you don't plan to attend.    The phone number for the conference call is:      +1 617 258 7910    There will be an accompanying IRC channel #rdfcore on  irc.openprojects.net:      irc://irc.openprojects.net/rdfcore    The IRC channel will be used to take notes of the meeting and may be  used to 'raise a hand' to indicate a desire to speak.      We would like to keep things reasonably informal.  There are just a few  procedural matters to propose:    W3C process calls for an agenda to be available 24 hours before the  conference.  If you'd like to suggest items for the agenda, please send  them to the chairs by 0900 UK time on the Thursday before the meeting.    I suggest we aim to have any documents due for discussion at a  conference distributed by the same time.    We will call for a volunteer scribe for each meeting.  The idea is to  share this task around.  In the absence of volunteers, the chairs will  appoint someone.  The scribe should use the IRC channel to record their  notes.  Actions should be circulated within 24 hours and minutes should  be curculated with 48 hours of the end of the meeting.  The IRC log and  the minutes will be publicly visible.    Thats about it for phone conferences.  See you on Friday 27th.    Brian

For example:  if you change the   >title of your document, it affects all the others.    Frank makes a good point here.  I'm only just beginning to appreciate how   tricky it must be to keep the docs in sync.  I was looking at Dave's syntax   document yesterday and noticed that he has some pretty precise references   to internal sections of the concepts doc (e.g. 2.4.4 ...)    I guess we need a policy on how to handle these.  This is really up to the   editors though I have a suggestion.  We could aim to have a reference   freeze about a week before final review and publication.  In that week the   editors are not allowed to change section numbers, etc.  Each editor must   go through his doc in that week and check that all references are correct.    Brian        

        I just peeked into the list after a couple of days of working on other   stuff and this was the first message I saw.  I am responding to it without   having seen other recent traffic.    Have we not discussed different ways of doing datatyping enough?    The issues that Graham addresses here are closed.  I hope the WG will have   the self discipline to recognise that, and that this will be the only   response on the list to Graham's post.

        Folks,    We need to get some of the outstanding test cases reviewed.  Please can you   take a look at       http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/allTestCases.html    pick you favourite unreviewed tests and volunteer to review them,   preferably by Friday.    Jan: is there a difference between PENDING and UNAPPROVED?    Brian

The RDF   test cases should test rdf.  Lets keep to any dependencies of subtle   aspects of xml schema datatypes out of it.  This point seems to be subtle   enough to have misled DanC.  And lets not give ourselves any more work than   we have to.  We are a little short of time after all.    Dan, if you want this to go into an rdf test suite, I'd like to see a   compelling reason why its necessary for RDF.  The XML schema guys can do   their own.    Brian

Or to put it another  way, are you suggesting that it is in some way illegal for me to  describe in RDF a service that buys roses, lest somewhere, there  might be a service that sells roses and I would thus have created  a query relationship between the two and that is beyond the scope  of M&S 1.0?

The example as originally presented was not clear enough as  much detail had been removed, perversely, to try to make it clearer.    Brian        

        Dave Reynolds was asking me about the relationship between plain   literals and xsd:string, i.e is a plain literal without a lang tag   (modulo some funny characters) an xsd:string.    I adopted the policy of referring him to the spec and indeed he came   back and said "found it, its in the bit about entailment rules."    "Bu**er", I said, that section is now informative!    I just wanted to check whether we have a normative statement in the   specs that    _:a eg:prop "aaa" .    xsd:string entails    _:a eg:prop "aaa"^^xsd:string .    for suitable values of "aaa".  I should check this myself, but I'm   burned this morning and don't want to forget ...    Anyone know?  Does it matter?  Is there anything else we might have lost   by making that section informative?    Brian

The syntax clearly allows anonymous resources.  I think you have just  said that a parser, which on receiving RDF/XML containing anon  resources, assigned URI's to the anon resources when spitting out the  triples would not be representing exactly the information it had  as input.  Are we agreeing on this?    To represent exactly the information recieved, anon resources must  be a part of the model/abstract syntax.  Yes?

My point here is that the abstract model should be able to represent  *exactly* the information that SOURCE intended to sign.  Any subsequent  inferences are the responsibility of the recipient.

        DRAFT For Consideration by RDFCore    Differences from previous draft:       o #owlref-rdfcore-enumerated-datatype-in-xml - corrected RDF/XML per   comments from Jos and jjc       o #owlref-rdfcore-annotation-restriction - modified text in light of   comments from Jos and jjc to indicated that we believe this is an editorial   error and the restrictions are not intended to apply to OWL Full.       o #owlref-rdfcore-datatypes-attributes-have-not added at jjc's   suggestion (taken from 'other' comments)       o #owlref-rdfcore-owl-class-denotation - added per jjc's suggestion as a   request for test cases to illustrate the differences between owl:Class and   rdfs:Class.    There were comments by Jos and jjc on   #owlref-rdfcore-transitive-datatype-properties.  I'm not clear if they were   suggesting a change.    Brian      -----------------------------------------      The RDFCore WG has reviewed the Owl Reference last call WD at       http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-ref-20030331/    RDFCore congratulates the WEBONT WG and particularly the authors and   editors of the reference document for its quality and clarity.    For the convenience of WEBONT we have given an ID to each   comment.  Comments not specific to RDFCore's interests will be sent   separately by the reviewer.    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-owl-rdf-semantics    We particularly admire the clarity of this note in 8.1 and request that a   similarly worded sentence be added to 1.2 para 2 and that the note in 1.4   be phrased in the same or similar manner.    [[  NOTE: RDF documents will generally be in OWL Full, unless they are   specifically constructed to be in OWL DL or Lite.  ]]    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-owl-class-denotation    It has been suggested to RDFCore that owl:Class is not needed.  RDFCore   requests the creation of test cases to clearly illustrate the differences   between owl:Class and rdfs:Class.    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-what-is-a-class-description      [[  3.1 Class descriptions    A class description is the term used in this document (and in the OWL   Semantics and Abstract Syntax) for the basic building blocks of class   axioms (informally called class definitions in the Overview and Guide   documents). OWL distinguishes six types of class descriptions:        1. a class identifier (a URI reference)      2. an exhaustive enumeration of individuals that together form the   instances of a class      3. a property restriction      4. the intersection of two or more class descriptions      5. the union of two or more class descriptions      6. the complement of a class description  ]]    Its not clear from the text what a class description is.  We take it to be   an RDF Graph (a set of triples) describing a class.  The above seems to say:       a class identifier (a URI reference) is a type of RDF graph    which doesn't make sense.  Similarly, the meaning of       the compliment of an RDF graph    isn't clear.    Whilst this is just wordsmithing, the concept of a class description is of   prime importance to the rest of the spec and should be clear.    Further:    [[  NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of the type   2-6, this has the extra effect of providing a way of referring to the class   description by its name, i.e., as a class description of type 1. See   Section 3.2.3 for details.  ]]    Does this name identify the class description, or the class described by   the description?  We suspect the latter, in which case:    [[  NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of the type   2-6, this has the extra effect of providing a way of referring to the class   so described by its name. See Section 3.2.3 for details.  ]]    There are other instances of this confusion: e.g. in 3.1.2    [[  A value constraint puts constraints on the value range of the property when   applied to this particular class description.  ]]    The constraint is on the property when applied to an instance of the class   described by this particular class description.    In 3.2    [[  * rdfs:subClassOf allows one to say that the class extension of a class   description is a subset of the class extension of another class description.  ]]    and 3.2.1    [[  A class description is by definition a subclass of itself.  ]]    which seems to confuse the notion of class and class description.    ------------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-use-ntriples    [[  "Human rdf:type owl:Class .".  ]]    In the interests of inter-spec consistency we request that WEBONT docs use   the same abbreviated form of n-triples as the RDF docs, which would make   the above    [[  "base:Human rdf:type owl:class ."  ]]  with some appropriate explanation of what base is.    -------------------------      #owlref-rdfcore-domain-range-value terminology    Throught the documents various terms, such as "value range", "range value",   "range", "domain", "domain value" are use to talk about the values of   properties.  Several of these terms are undefined, they often are used   inconsistently and there seems to be unnecessary duplication in the use of   the terms.    The term "value range" is used in the document and is not defined.  We   suggest the meaning of this term be clearly defined if it is to be   used.  However, it seems to mean the same thing as the term 'range' defined   in RDFS, so the definition of a new term may be redundant.    Confusingly, the term "range value" is also used in the document and is not   defined.  We suggest the meaning of this term be clearly defined if it is   to be used.  However, it seems to mean the same thing as the term 'value'   as used in RDFS, so the definition of a new term may be redundant.    We also note that it is used inconsistently.    In 3.1.2    [[  Property restrictions can be applied both to datatype properties   (properties for which the range value is a data literal) and object   properties (properties for which the range value is an individual).  ]]    it appears to be used to refer to thing denoted by the object of a triple.    In 3.1.2.1 it is used to state a syntactic constraint on OWL Lite documents.    [[  NOTE: In OWL Lite the range value of owl:allValuesFrom must be a class   identifier.  ]]    Here it refers to the object of the triple, not the thing the object denotes.    And further that the term 'value' seems to suffice elsewhere, e.g. 3.1.2.1:    [[  To see why this is so, observe that the owl:allValuesFrom constraint   demands that all values of P belong to class P, and if no such values   exist, the constraint is trivially true.  ]]      4.2    [[  Syntactically, owl:equivalentProperty is a property with as both domain and   range an instance of rdf:Property.  ]]    The domain of a property is a class, as is the range.  And domain and range   aren't about syntax (occurs elsewhere also).  Suggest:    [[  owl:equivalentProperty is a property.  Its rdfs:domain is rdf:Property, as   is its rdfs:range.  ]]    or less formally    [[  owl:equivalentProperty is a property is a property that relates two properties.  ]]    In owl:backwardCompatibleWith    [[  The owl:backwardCompatibleWith construct is a property with an instance of   the class owl:Ontology as its domain and range.  ]]    This is further confusion over the use of the terms domain and   range.  Domains and Ranges of properties are classes, not instances.  Nor   is the construct a property!    [[  owl:backwardCompatibleWith is a property.  Its domain is owl:Ontology as is   its range.  ]]    We request:       o A global check throughout the document of all uses of all terms   involving the words 'domain' and  'range'       o that wherever possible the terminology used in the RDFCore specs be   adopted       o where RDFCore does not provide appropriate terminology, that any new   terms be defined and used consistently       o RDFCore would be willing to help discuss appropriate terminology    -----------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-value-space    In 3.1.2.2    [[  The cardinality constraint owl:maxCardinality is a built-in OWL property   that links a restriction class to a data value belonging to the range of   the XML Schema datatype nonNegativeInteger.  ]]    We believe the correct term is "the value space of the XML Schema datatype   nonNegativeInteger".    Similarly in minCardinality.    -------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-individual-identity    5.2 Individual Identity    This section should include some words about URIREF comparison, probably   with a reference to rdf concepts where we say how URIREFS are compared.       http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#section-Graph-URIref    ---------------------------------  #owlref-rdfcore-datatypes-attributes-have-not    6.1 Datatypes    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype ...  ]]    Its not the literal that has an XML attribute - that is the way it is   written in rdf/xml.    Suggest:    [[  In RDF/XML, the type of a literal is specified by an "rdf:datatype" attribute.  ]]    Similarly:    [[  When using datatypes, please note that even if the range of a property is   declared to be of a certain datatype, RDF still requires a rdf:datatype   attribute in a statement about this property, otherwise it is treated as a   plain literal.  ]]    Suggest:    [[  When using datatypes, please note that even if a property is defined to   have a range of a certain datatype, RDF/XML still requires that the   datatype be specified each time the property is used.  ]]    -------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-rdfs:literal-not-a-datatype    [[  A typed literal needs to have an XML attribute rdf:datatype of which the   value is recommended to be one of the following:  ...    # The RDF datatype rdfs:Literal  which is the class of literals, typed and   plain.  ]]    rdfs:Literal is not a datatype.    ----------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-qnames-in-rdfxml    In 6.2 we see:    [[              <rdf:first rdf:datatype="xsd:integer">0</rdf:first>  ]]    A qname is not allowed as the value of an rdf:datatype property.  This   should be:    [[              <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">0</rdf:first>  ]]    ---------------------------------      #owlref-rdfcore-enumerated-datatype-in-xml    6.2 Enumerated datatype    We suggest the following form for writing the syntax of lists with literal   values, which we believe is more slightly more readable and better suited   to longer lists.    [[  <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID="tennisGameScore">     <rdfs:range>       <owl:DataRange>         <owl:oneOf>             <rdf:List>             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">0</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:nodeID="l2"/>           </rdf:List>             <rdf:List rdf:nodeID="l2">             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">15</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:nodeID="l3"/>           </rdf:List>             <rdf:List rdf:nodeID="l3">             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">30</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:nodeID="l4"/>           </rdf:List>             <rdf:List rdf:nodeID="l4">             <rdf:first rdf:datatype="&xsd;integer">30</rdf:first>             <rdf:rest rdf:resource="&rdf;nil"/>           </rdf:List>           </owl:oneOf>       </owl:DataRange>     </rdfs:range>  </owl:DatatypeProperty>  ]]    ---------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-annotation-restriction    7.1 Annotations    [[       * Annotation properties must not be used in property axioms (e.g., no   subproperties are allowed).  ]]    We believe there may be an editorial error here, and that this restriction   is not intended to apply to OWL Full.    As stated, since rdfs:domain and rdfs:range are property axioms, this means   that we can't define a domain and range for an annotation property in   Owl.  Further rdfs defines rdfs:isDefinedBy to be a subproperty of   rdfs:seeAlso.  That would mean that not all RDF graphs are legal OWL Full,   and that in fact the graph for RDF Schema is not legal OWL Full.    ------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-class-ontology    RDFCore makes this point with some trepidation, not wishing to cause WEBONT   to waste time and energy on a discussion with little practical impact.    In 7.2    [[  An ontology header component is represented with an instance of the class   owl:Ontology, which typically identifies the containing document with a   same-document reference [section 4.2 of RFC2396], and which may optionally   contain, in any order, any number of import and/or versioning statements.  ]]    This seems to say that instances of the class owl:Ontology are   documents.  RDFCore suggests that the text be modified to be less   specific.  There are also potential difficulties with the reference to RFC   2396; it would be better to refer to the RDF specs and let them take the   heat on any 'interpretation' of RFC 2396.    We suggest:    [[  A document describing an ontology typically contains information about the   ontology itself.  An ontology is a resource, so may be described using   properties from the OWL and other namespaces, e.g.    <owl:Ontology rdf:about="">     <owl:versionInfo> ... </owl:versionInfo>     <rdfs:comment>...</rdfs:comment>     <owl:imports rdf:resource='...'/>  </owl:Ontology>    This is commonly called the ontology header and is typically found near the   beginning of the RDF/XML document.  The line       <owl:Ontology rdf:about="">    states that this block describes the current ontology.  More precisely, it   states the current base URI identifies an instance of the class   owl:Ontology.  As noted earlier, it is recommended that the base URI be   defined using an xml:base attribute in the <rdf:RDF> element at the   beginning of the document.  ]]  ----------------------------------------    #owlref-rdfcore-transitive-datatype-properties    In 8.1    [[  Although from the semantics point of view it is not forbidden in OWL Full   to declare datatype properties to be inverse, transitive, or symmetric, in   practice this does not make much sense.

        This talk sets the scene for our work on semantic web architecture.  It   presents a high level overview of semantic web architecture and indicates   those areas in which we are contributing.  It describes our work updating   the RDF specifications, identifying the issues that needed to be addressed   and describing the techniques that have been used to address them.        

        Here is my summary of the new semantics initiative as I understand it so far:    There are two separable issues being discussed under this title:       o using a melange of model theories to define the semantics of SW   languages isn't going to work, as demonstrated by webont       o a mechanism for darkening some triples in a non-monotonic way.    I muddied the waters by introducing the second into this thread.  That was   a mistake.  This summary is just about the first issue.    It is proposed to produce a W3C note which outlines a strategy for defining   the semantics of SW languages in terms of Lbase, a representation of FOL.    A new deliverable by RDFCore WG is proposed.  This will define the   semantics of RDF in terms of Lbase.  It is proposed that this document is   in addition to the model theory document and will define exactly equivalent   semantics to the model theory.    This proposal is motivated by a concern that:       o model theory is hard:  it will take a lot (more than available) of   expert effort for each SW language to define its semantics as a model theory       o it is not clear how the model theories of multiple SW languages can be   combined to provide a clear semantics for mixed language documents    The proposed new document is expected to have minimal effects on the   content of the RDF/XML syntax doc, the primer, the RDF schema doc and the   test cases doc and only minor effects on the model theory doc.    It is suggested that it is important to include this new deliverable in the   current round of deliverables by RDFCore so that it has normative status   enabling other WG's (webont?) to build on it. [I'm not sure about this one   - see below]    It is suggested that this new form of representing the semantics will be   easier for folks to understand.    Jos has tested the new proposal in Euler and found no bugs.    It is suggested that this is a harmless change; if it isn't adopted by say   webont, it will still do some good and no harm.    I have spoken to some of the webont folks here, (Horrocks, PFPS, van   Harmlen) and got a mixed response.  One criticism is timing; a concern that   layering is a deep and hard issue that needs careful consideration, not   rushing in at the last minute.    I assume that the proposed new document is not normative as it is based on   Lbase which is defined in a note.  Is this a problem?  At least it ducks   the question of which is right if the axiomatic and model theory semantics   disagree.    I have a number of process concerns about this, in particular I would like   to ensure that the whole community expert in this issue is involved working   it out, but that doesn't sound like a good thing to do to RDFCore right now.    Brian        

        It would appear that folks are biting at the bit to discuss untyped literal   semantics.  As this is a topic that arouses some passions, I'd like to   suggest some guidelines for how we conduct it.    My first suggestion is that we use rdf/xml syntax throughout.  The issue is   not really what:       <a> <b> "foo" .    means.  As Pat has recently shown, we can create new constructions in   n-triples more or less at will. That still leaves the question of what does   the following rdf/xml translate to in terms of n-triples.       <rdf:Description rdf:nodeID="jenny">       <foo:age>10</foo:age>     </rdf:Description>    I suggest the issues here arise in RDF/XML, for example in CC/PP and DC and   what will be readily understood by our community of rdf/xml users.    Secondly, I suggest we aim to decide, one way or the other.  As some folks   have recently pointed out there may be the possibility of ducking the   question.  My motivation in getting involved in this WG was a desire to   make the current specs more clear and precise.  I suggest it would be   better to decide if we possibly can.  Only if we cannot, should we duck the   question.    Third, I suggest we are choosing between one of three options:       o untyped literals are self denoting     o untyped literals denote a value from the value space of some datatype     o we can't decide    Please can we couch any discussion in terms of advantages and disadvantages   of these choices.  As this is an issue which can ascend to the   philosophical, I suggest we give greater weight to pragmatic concerns.    Finally, I suggest we guillotine the discussion.  The decision will be made   at the telcon of 20th Sept unless a consensus emerges before then.    Brian        

      Jeremy Carroll in      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Jul/0041.html    has raised some test cases we ought to clarify:      <rdf:Description rdf:Description="foo"/>      <rdf:Description>      <rdf:Description>foo</rdf:Description>    </rdf:Description>      <rdf:Description>      <rdf:Bag>foobar</rdf:Bag>    </rdf:Description>      <rdf:Description rdf:aboutEachPrefix="foo"/>      <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>    </rdf:Description>    Also, he is questioning our resolution of:      <rdf:_1>      <foo:bar>foobar</foo:bar>    </rdf:_1>    These are basically about what to do with names that are 'recognised'  as being part of the RDF namespace but appear out of context.  I'll  add this as a new issue to the list.  We probably ought to try to  give it some attention as it has been raised on rdf-interest.    Brian

The W3C RDF validator consists of two components:       o parser     o a servlet that implements the web functionality    The parser is ARP and does support literals as pairs.    The servlet does not support language.  This is because the servlet was   originally written to work with sirpac which I believe is one of the   parsers which does treat literals as strings.

I understand there was at one time (1st Apr 19xx) an RFC including a  mime type for matter transfer.

There are several such 'model theories' if that is the right term that  will work for us.  I picked this one as it seemed to me most consistent  with M&S.  However, I'm more concerned that we have agreed on one, than I  am about any particular one.      >   > Finally, even though you can imagine two resources being mapped to the  > same entity, if different people are doing the mappings, it isn't  > necessarily going to be easy to decide when two resources are really  > equivalent.    That may well be true :(.  The reason for introducing equivalence was not  so that we could mechanically decide that two resources are equivalent, but  so that our model could represent equivalence.    There isn't anything particularly deep here, its just about what we call  things.  Web principles state that we can't rely on there being one true  URI identifying a particular entity - e.g. tree in the park.  Anyone is  free to define a URI to name this tree.  So we have a choice:      - Resources have more that one URI    - each URI identifies a different resource, but we have the notion      of equivalence classes of resources    I felt that the latter is closer to M&S and RDF.

        Gentlemen,    We are scheduled to take a last call vote Friday.

Reading Peter's   latest post,       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jan/0091.html    [[Actually, it might be OK, but only because of the wording outside of the  conditions that the extra conditions are ``on all datatypes other than the  built-in datatype''.  This wording is cryptic in the extreme.  There also  needs to be some clarification here as to whether datatypes are members of the  domain or URI references.]]    my interpretation is that there may be some further clarification needed,   but that can be done during last call.       - LBase has been ready to go for a while    It would be helpful if the schema reviewers could indicate by email that   the proposed changes are acceptable and deal with their issues.

      I will schedule time for discussion at this weeks telecon.    I suggest that this weeks email discussion has been useful.  I think we  now have a clearer understanding of the issue - at least I feel I do.    Let me try to do a little summing up.  I think we have identified  two questions.  Is this a change to M&S?  If it is, then are there  compelling reasons why we should make a change?    I have asked the question:      o Does the formal model described in M&S have a distinguished       representation for literals.    I have seen that several people think that it does.  When Aaron says:      Yes, there is a set of things in M&S called "Literals". Whether this     is a side-effect of the XML syntax, or of the abstract syntax is     not clear to me.    I take it that he is undecided.  It would be helpful Aaron if you could  come to view on this before the telecon, as I would like the WG to decide  this question.  It may be helpful to consider the following quote from  section 5 of M&S:          and the corresponding triple (member of Statements) would be           {creator, [http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila], "Ora Lassila"}          The notation [I] denotes the resource identified by the URI I         and quotation marks denote a literal.    If the WG decides YES on the first question, then to represent literals   as resources in the abstract model would be a change.  The second question  then is:      Is there a compelling reason why we should make this change?    Compelling reasons might include - the current spec is unimplementable,  is not being implemented, contradicts some other part of M&S or  the change is needed to resolve some other issue.    Aaron I believe is suggesting that since literals have identity, they  satisfy the only requirement to be a resource.  It would thus simplify  both the abstract model and implementations to remove them as a  distingished entity from the abstract model.

        Given:      o I am hoping to have last call candidates for concepts, syntax, mt and   test cases by the telecon    o Frank, to the best of my knowledge is still aiming to have a primer lcc   by the telecon    o Primer is not ready    o a significant number of people can't make the 3/Jan telecon    o 10/Jan is a webont f2f with a significant number of people missing    I am minded to conclude that last call cannot be accomplished this year and   we should give ourselves time for a final look over the docs.    I am therefore suggesting:       o we maintain our goal of completing lcc's for all docs except schema by   13/Dec and begin last review of them from that time       o we aim to have a lcc schema by 03 Jan       o we vote last call on all except schema at the telecon of 10 Jan, folks   not attending sending a proxy       o we vote last call on schema at 17 Jan telecon       o all last call docs are published by 24 Jan    Brian

Could be.  Pat did talk about the integer 5 being a literal which is  not the same thing as the string "5".  I figured we could stay  agnostic on this till we get to datatyping.    Brian        

        Hmm,    I was just wondering that myself.    I see the following possible agenda items for a telecon:    a) wording changes to the semantics doc  b) advice to the CG about what to do about postponed issues    Dan, would you like the WG to meet to discuss/approve the proposed   wording changes?  Will the 16th be soon enough?    Eric, is the CG seeking input from the WG about b).    WG, do folks want to meet to discuss a), b) or anything else?    I will send a formal notification of a telecon for 16th Jan, but will   cancel if its not needed.    Dan, I hope you have fun on Friday.

Err, no - we really don't want to do that.  it would be a bad thing if  the meaning of an existing document changed when we updated the spec.

In my view, webont are a very important customer of our work.  When I took   this on, I believed that the major challenge we faced is that RDF is trying   to serve two masters, those who want a simple meta data language and those   who want a formal foundation for it.  That's hard, but that is what we are   trying to do.    At the very least we must not mess things up for webont to build on rdf.    Brian

I thought the owl notion was more restrictive, i.e.    owl:subClassOf is a subset of rdfs:subClassOf but not the other way  round.    You are saying owl:subClassOf can have a member <c1, c2> that is not a  member of rdfs:subClassOf?    Brian

I think that can be done.  I'd rather spend my time between now and  the telecon reviewing the docs.    Syntax is first on the agenda because my memory from last week's telecon  was we decided that was the one we would do first.    Brian
