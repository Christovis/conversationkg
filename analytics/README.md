# Analytics

### Settings of hypothesis testing:

* testing aptness of our extracted KG 

* testing aptness of our extracted KG as a basis for ML-assisted analytics <br>
  e.g. by treating our own extracted KG as ground truth and testing the efficacy of link prediction algorithms on that KG in helping human analysts <br>
 => operationalisation: train link prediction on KG, distort the KG with omitted true links/added false links, measure how well human analysts reconstruct original KG aided by link prediction system <br>
