(I'm not sure of all the possibilities).    I think that's partially true. But there is no guarantee, for example,  that style sheets are used by the browser to style the selection/focus.  So, even if you give access to style sheets, unless you give access  to the rendering structure, you still may not have the control that you  seek.     Furthermore, I think the selection and focus are considered part of the  user interface (though they can designate content), and here we are  specifically talking about access to content, not the user interface  (covered by checkpoint 5.4, which mentions focus and selection  explicitly).    > As said in the teleconference, the AT historically uses an Off Screen Model (OSM). > The making of an OSM is difficult because it involves reverse engineering the  > rendering proces.

To paraphrase:   1) The AT must not be forced to rely on the rendering structure.   2) The AT may want to use some information provided by the rendering  structure.    > Now what the UAGL currently says is that new/future AT is much helped with access  > to the DOM.

Though I understand the value of being able to synchronize views, and  of an AT wanting to know what's on the screen, I'm still not convinced  that access to style sheets + the source tree will suffice. Suppose the   author has used style sheets to reposition content (with the 'float' or   'position' properties). In this case, the graphical layout may have  nothing to  do with the tree order. So an AT walking the tree and reading computed  property values would basically have to implement CSS floats and  positioning to figure out the screen layout. While an AT providing  a non-graphical rendering could ignore many of the CSS visual properties  (e.g., font-family), there are many it could not (e.g., font-size)  since they have an effect on layout, and that seems to interest ATs.    An attempt to summarize scenarios and difficulties:    1) If an AT works with a source tree and applies style sheets itself,     it's basically a stand-alone user agent. In this case, for example,     the AT should respect the media types described in the CSS2 spec [1]     (e.g., braille, aural). In this case, the user agent doesn't     need to support the DOM CSS module since the AT is implementing     CSS anyway.    2) If an AT wants the rendering of a "host" user agent, it can      compute some useful information from the DOM tree in conjunction     with the DOM CSS module (which offers computed CSS property     values, I believe, for each node in the DOM tree). This obviously     requires ATs to be CSS-aware, even if they don't implement     all of CSS. There are at least two limitations to this approach,     however:            a) The host user agent may not base its rendering entirely             on CSS (e.g., for selection and focus and possibly more),             therefore, the CSS information will not suffice.            b) CSS positioning would require that the AT calculate             positions itself in order to know the layout of             rendered content. This includes z-index, which              specifies how to layer content on the screen.             Other properties, such as 'clip' and 'overflow' will             also affect what's finally rendered.            c) You could even imagine other cases such as text with             the same background and foreground color (thus, invisible             to the user). The AT would have to take into account             color values as well.        My conclusion from these examples, which are surely not      exhaustive, is that for an AT to really know what the host      UA has rendered, it will have to recognize/implement most      CSS properties.    3) If an AT wants the rendering of a "host" user agent, it can     ask for the UA's rendering structure. However, there are no     APIs that I know of for accessing the rendering structure of     a user agent. That's why ATs have had to rely on offscreen models,     I believe.        In my opinion, adding a requirement that a user agent expose     its (possibly proprietary) internal representation of the     rendering structure is an additional requirement in these guidelines     that should cause us to return to Working Draft status (e.g.,     last call).     I do not deny that there may be cases where access to the  rendered content of the UA will interest the AT. I also agree with  Hans that access to source style sheets is priority 1 WHEN the AT   implements the style sheet language (scenario 1 above). Access to  style sheets may not be priority 2 in scenario 2, where the   property values have already been computed (and where media types  are not significant since the AT is relying on the media type  of the host user agent, not its own).     I am very relieved that we have identified this issue during  Candidate Recommendation. I would phrase this issue: "Should the UA  be required to provide access to its rendering structure?" I envision  a couple of possible solutions:      1) We answer "no" for this version of the Guidelines and move on.    2) We answer "yes" and limit ourselves to providing access       to the DOM core + DOM CSS module (which was, in essence, our       resolution yesterday [2]) and we acknowledge that this might       not satisfy all needs of an AT.    3) We answer "yes" and impose a new requirement to provide       access to the internal rendering structure, and (in my opinion)       we return to Working Draft since this is a significant new       requirement.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0374.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I understand that adding requirements for the implementation of   audio, graphics, and video would be consistent with the direction  we've been moving and would allow us to delete another applicability  provision. Considering your comments below from a different angle:    a) We clearly want the document to apply to user agents that      render both visual and audio information.     b) Would we be satisfied with audio rendering alone or visual     rendering alone? I am inclined to say yes to both of these      cases, as long as information is available to assistive      technologies and the claim states which checkpoints are considered     inapplicable.       Suppose that the user agent does not have a graphical  user interface and only renders audio content. The following  checkpoints would not apply: part of 2.4, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.9,  4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, part of 4.5 and 4.6, 4.7, and 10.9.  This means that 12 full checkpoints and parts of 2 checkpoints   would not apply out of 81 total checkpoints (around 15%).     Suppose that the user agent does not handle audio. The  following checkpoints would not apply: part of 2.4, 3.2,  part of 4.5 and 4.6, 4.8, and 4.9.        In both cases, add three more inapplicable checkpoints   if the UA doesn't do speech synthesis.    This is not the definitive list of inapplicable checkpoints,  but I conclude after a cursory review that we've done a pretty  good job at organizing the document and designing requirements  that are independent of content type except when content type  is part of the requirement. I also think that when more than  80% of the checkpoints apply, that's good enough to be a useful  indication of the applicability of the document to the subject  of the claim.    We have not spent much time discussing tactile rendering. I don't  think we would object to a claim of conformance by a user agent  that offered a tactile rendering and user interface in conjunction  with either audio or visual rendering, or both. I don't think   we intended to allow conformance by a user agent that offered only  tactile rendering, even if the user agent implemented the DOM.    > ========  >   > Suggestion 2: Gather data to strengthen our understanding of some key  > questions related to assistive technologies, plug-ins, and add-ons, etc.  >   > The 1 September 2000 draft moves in the right direction by clarifying the  > relationship between the UAAG document and assistive technologies:  >   > "3.2 Which user agents are expected to conform"  >   > "Users with disabilities often require more than one user agent for full  > access to the Web.

First, there is no need for an explicit statement that the checkpoints  in question are applicable because all checkpoints are applicable  by default. From section 3.4:         At each conformance level, the user agent must satisfy        each checkpoint required for that level unless:    Four applicability exceptions follow, but I don't believe the DOM  to fall under any of them. Thus, the user agent must satisfy the  checkpoints of guideline 5. The DOM API must be implemented for   access to all content, however the rest of the (composite) user   agent is implemented (as modules).     > ====  >   > b.

What specifications does text reader implement? Does it communicate  with other software? Does it have a user interface? Does it have  documentation? Is it configurable? As long as these questions apply  to the component, then I believe the requirements apply as well.    Here's another way to ask the question: Should we have a document  that allows Lynx to conform (providing that Lynx implements the DOM)?    > ====  >   > e.

      Hello,    In the 7 July Guidelines [1], checkpoint 9.3 (Priority 3) reads:       Allow the user to configure notification preferences for      common types of content and viewport changes.        Note: For example, allow the user to choose to be notified         (or not) that a script has been executed, that        a new viewport has been opened, that a pulldown menu has        been opened, that a new frame has received focus, etc.     1) Since this checkpoint does not specify that it is about notification     through an API (which is covered by checkpoint 5.5), our document     says that this checkpoint refers to notification through the     user interface.     2) Looking back at the history of the checkpoint     (checkpoint 10.2 was introduced in the 9 July 1999 draft [3]), I      believe that originally this requirement was supposed to apply to      notification through an API and notification through the UI.      Refer to 30 June 1999 discussion [4]. We dropped filters     on the API notification at some point since applications can      filter out whatever they wish.    3) If notification is to be provided through the UI, then by     default all events would have to be indicated to the user.     How would that work in practice? We have to address that     question before we discuss how filtering will work.     4) If we try to identify a minimal set of events that are     "common types of content and viewport changes", what      would be in that set? We could use the information     in the Note after the checkpoint, but that list is     short and two of them are covered by other checkpoints:       a) a script has been executed     b) a viewport has been opened (but control over viewport opening        is covered by checkpoint 4.16).     c) a pulldown menu has been opened.      d) a new frame has received focus (but control of focus         change is covered by checkpoint 4.15).       I would note that checkpoint 1.5 already requires that messages     from the UA have text equivalents in the UI.    5) The techniques document [2] talks about frame techniques but mostly     disabling notification of changes (on an element basis, for css  properties,     and for changing animations. In short, we don't have many techniques     explaining what events should trigger notifications, nor how that     information could be communicated to the user (e.g., through the     status bar).    6) Who does notification through the UI benefit? For users with     assistive technologies, we already require that all changes     be sent through an API. What users using the UA's native     UI benefit from notification of changes?    I'm looking for answers to these questions to figure out what  the minimal requirements for 9.3 are or whether we should delete it.  I realize that notification is very important, but we should flesh  this checkpoint out before we continue with it.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707/  [2]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000707/#tech-configure-change-notification  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0265.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I'll add a statement to this effect:          In general, user agents ignore HTML attributes they        don't support and they render the content of         unsuppored elements.    (I'm not sure why OBJECT "hurts".

      Hello,    In the Candidate Rec of the UAAG 1.0, checkpoint 6.2 reads:       "Conform to W3C specifications when they are appropriate       for a task. [Priority 2]."    The WG has already resolved [2] to change the wording to:        "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are        available and appropriate for a task."     I propose changing "specifications" to "Recommendations".  This would narrow the scope of the requirement. It would not  prevent user agents from conforming to additional levels  of documents, but would only require conformance to  Recommendations. Furthermore, we should note in the Techs  document that developers should pay close attention to  Candidate Rec drafts.    I would like to discuss this at the 9 March meeting. Please  voice any objections before then.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128   [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/03/wai-ua-telecon-20000302.html     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I finally read the glossary of the 23 March 2001 draft [1].  I don't have any significant complaints (and will make a few  minor editorial clarifications in the next draft).    Two points caught my eye that I wanted to mention to the WG.    1) The definition of "documentation" reads:       "Documentation refers to all information provided      by the vendor about a product, including all product      manuals, installation instructions, the help system,       and tutorials."       This sounds too normative to me. Our documentation      *requirements* are expressed by Guideline 12. Those     five checkpoints make requirements about (1) what must     be in the documentation and (2) the accessibility of     the documentation.       I think the definition needs to be written in a manner     that doesn't suggest that it adds requirements (e.g.,     that the vendor is required to write tutorials in order     to conform).        Also "all information provided by the vendor about a product"     is far too broad. This might include press releases, TV     commercials, etc.       As for other features, the claimant may decide to include     or exclude different pieces of documentation based on whether     they conform. The only *required* documentation is that required     by the checkpoints of Guideline 12.       Therefore, I propose the following change to the definition:       <NEW>     "Documentation refers to information that supports the      use of a product. This information may be found in product      manuals, installation instructions, the help system,       tutorials, etc. Documentation may be distributed; it may      be delivered on CD-ROM or available on the Web. Refer to      Guideline 12 for information about documentation requirements.     </NEW>    2) We define "document source view" but we don't use it      in any of the checkpoints. Checkpoint 2.2 says "provide      a view of the text source."         I propose to leave 2.2 as is and to delete "document source      view" from the glossary.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010323/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

This issue will  involve a proposal to list explicitly for checkpoint 7.6 those  elements in HTML 4 we mean. This list would include MAP. Therefore,  I don't think a new checkpoint is necessary since the user can  get to the MAP as part of structured navigation. I don't know why  one-step navigation to a MAP is more important than one-step   navigation to H1s.

      8 March 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0326    Minutes of previous meeting 1-2 March 2001:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes    Next meeting: 15 March teleconference   Regrets: Mickey Quenzer (at son's graduation for basic training),            Jon Gunderson, Jim Allan    Present:    Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs (scribe), Harvey Bingham,    David Poehlman, Mickey Quenzer, Tim Lacy, Jim Allan,   Charles, McCathieNevile, Gregory Rosmaita, Eric Hansen,   Rich Schwerdtfeger       Note: I will stop indicating Kitch Barnicle and Denis Anson as either  regrets or absent since they have indicated that they cannot attend  the meeting regularly. I hope you guys will still read the minutes!    ----------  Announcements  ----------     IJ: New draft will be available in a couple of days.    ----------  Discussion  ----------    1. Issue 464: Applicability clause needs review since "role" not    always known from format (e.g., captions in SMIL)    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#464      IJ: Background - E.g., SMIL captions not marked up as such    in captions.       CMN: Rather than change the applicability provision. Instead, I     think it might be useful to generalize some of the specific    requirements (e.g., requirement to position captions). The    implementation requirement doesn't change: you have to move    some to move all. I think the applicability clause should stand.      EH: Is middle ground possible (e.g., referring only to conditional    content)?      JG: What about "potentially for captions"?      IJ: But the SMIL spec doesn't say this. That's how WCAG says        to use it.      CMN: WAI PF wants to identify special relationships; but we can't at        the moment. I don't think this implies a broken model, however.      JG: What other technologies besides SMIL?     CMN: Navigation bars in HTML.      JG: Tim, is this harder to do (in general)?      TL: I can see Charles' point. I would consider the increase in scope    a fair increase in implementation burden. I don't know whether it     would be substantial.      GR: We discussed this at the ftf meeting in Princeton.      IJ: I think that this is a significant change, but the       right one in terms of our document's model. I resist it       due to the scope of the change.      EH: I agree with CMN that we don't need to change the applicability        statement.      /* Checkpoints really in question here from 24 Feb 2001 draft:      2.5, 4.6 */     CMN: Signed captions are video tracks. But still captions.      IJ: Captions not defined that way in our spec. {Limited to text.}      EH: The basic requirement is that if something has a time association,    you have to synchronize them. Unless we want to get into repair     functions, all you can ask is to implement the spec.       Action CMN: Find out from SYMM WG whether repositioning of    objects will appear in the spec (or should be in UAAG).      Some options:     a) Broaden the checkpoints.     b) Don't change the doc, some smil players won't have        to meet these requirements. Wait 'till SMIL specs fixed.      CMN: What PF is likely to come up with: RDF schema (e.g.,    W3C Note).      Leave spec as is.: TL, MQ, RS, JA, HB, EH, IJ    /* RS joins */      MQ: In addition to waiting for SMIL, any other groups?   CMN: Quicktime spec...      Broaden the checkpoint: DP, GR, CMN      IJ: It's the right solution, the wrong time for it.      HB: Digital talking book people are referencing SMIL 2.    They are presuming that will be strong enough.      IJ: Looking at Quicktime API, don't see anything specific        to text captions.      JA: This is called "Text stream"      TL: Nothing in HTML+Time to identify captions as such.      IJ: Proposal: add a P3 requirement for all objects.     CMN: I'd still write a minority opinion.      EH: It's a little strange to leave the checkpoint as is if        checkpoints 2.5 and 4.6 are not applicable. Does this        call for material in the introduction?     CMN: The original proposal at this meeting was to adjust the        applicability provision to special case this particular        requirement. But I think that's the wrong way to go        about it.    Resolved:    - No change to the document.   - People can file objections.    2. Issue 463: Create section on how to refer to UAAG from other     specifications    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#463      Resolved:     - Issue closed (not relevant to advancing of the document).     - No change to the document unless later proposal.      Action IJ: Take to the cross-WG WAI list.    3. Issue 462: Merging checkpoints related to automatic refresh    (3.5) and redirection (3.6)    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#462      IJ: Read my arguments for not changing the document.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0159      CMN: One reason to change: the priority to be able to go back     through things is closely related to the priority of the    functionality. I'm not convinced that the user can tell the    difference.      IJ: Yes to the user the same, but the UA developer may have    to implement different behaviors.      Resolved:     - No change to the document (do not merge checkpoints).    5. Issue 430: Checkpoint 3.2: Animations, not just animated images    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#430      See CMN's proposal:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0306      See IJ's proposal:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0352      EH: Is interactivity included?      IJ: For example, what if I reload the W3C home page over time?      TL: If you're requesting a refresh, that's a different class    of thing. I don't think we should define at what rate a    refresh becomes an animation. I don't think interactivity should    be included in what constitutes an animation.      /* MQ leaves, TL leaves */      CMN: I would argue that stuff that is defined in the page as    triggering the animation falls into this category, but reloading a    page manually does not.      GR: I like IJ's generic definition of animation.      IJ:      * I don't think the definition needs to be rock-solid.     * I would exclude manual interaction from the definition       (other than triggering).     * I think in practice we won't have too many problems       with edge cases "in practice" (people will know what       we mean).     * The important part for me was to use it consistently       in all three checkpoints.      Resolved:      - Adopt proposal (with editorial tweaks as indicated above):       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0352    6. Proposed changes to checkpoints related to focus, selection, and     current viewport    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0324        DP: See my question:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0337.html      DP: I think "navigation" says more than the things that replace it.    I'm not sure how to capture "what's missing".      IJ: I don't think that "navigate" says it any better. The term    "navigate" is better at the Guideline level.      GR: It needs to be clear that state persistence is bound to        navigation.      IJ: I think navigation includes pointing device navigation    (e.g., among viewports). But for the purposes of our document,    I think our requirements can be bound to the focus in particular.      DP: What about querying?      IJ: We have requirements for access to content through a viewport.    We call the act of getting that content moving ones point of regard.      DP: If I'm holding the Alt key down in Windows, without letting    it up, am I moving the point of regard?       IJ: Yes, but it's not the POR for very long.      EH: Is POR a time specific view of things?       IJ: It has time and space components.      EH: I like Ian's analysis that went into this. A large editorial    improvement.      IJ: Note, for example, that the highlight requirement does not    require highlighting of the viewport with the pointing device.    But I'm not worried since in practice the pointing device and    keyboard focus are bound anyway.      CMN: I have vague reservations but can't formulate them right now.        IJ: I would also note that I did not want to add pointing device    requirements at this time.      Resolved:     - Adopt proposal     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0324    7. Review of new checkpoints for the accessibility of elements     with event handlers     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes       Refer to JG comments about priority of "not activating automatically"     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0336       JG: We already have a requirement to turn off scripting altogether     (which would allow one to suppress auto-activation). CMN seemed ok     with a P2.       GR: I think the "all scripting off" requirement is too heavy     a requirement. This is like saying "turn all images off to turn     off background images". I think that this should be a P1     requirement. Refer to GR's questions:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0354.html       GR: The only way to get at multiple handlers is to get at the     suspended state.       IJ: I understand JG's comment to be:       - Turning off scripts is a global setting (P1)       - The proposed checkpoint is a per-element requirement (P2)      CMN: Authoring issue (finding out what a script will do).      CMN: I share the part of GR's concern that if you don't know that         something will be activated when you turn scripts back on         that something will happen.       JG: Right, if the UA considers that when scripts are turned off,         an element is no longer an enabled element, then you couldn't        navigate to it...      CMN: My preference is to leave it a P1 (as initially proposed)        rather than play with enabled element definition.      Resolved:     - Leave the new checkpoint for per-element non-auto triggering       of handlers a P1.      IJ: Refer to my question about what is not supposed to happen    in this configuration:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0351      IJ: Note the problem: if you turn off *all input behavior*, then    you lose tabbing navigation, etc.      CMN: You need to catch event bubbling...        IJ: But in our navigation scheme, you only ever land on     "top-level handlers".       CMN: It's an open question how events would be sent down to     elements.       JG: What happens, you don't know.      Resolved:     - The requirement to not fire event handlers        does not involve turning off stylistic effects.     - The requirement is for explicit user input device       event handlers assigned to an element.       {If you want no events fired, turn off scripts.}     - Since we may not know what was assigned by the author,       we'll make no distinction about what was assigned by       the author (or the AT). (In other words, no restriction       about set of event handlers.)    /* JA leaves */    IJ: The DOM won't tell you today which events will trigger which  handlers for all handlers; only those supplied by the author in the  source. We seem, on the other hand, to be requiring turning off of all  event handlers. The sets are different: the set the user sees, the set  that are turned off.

I think we shouldn't say "On that particular operating system, you can't  have any user agents at all that conform to UAAG 1.0 since there is no  standard API  for the keyboard." It does make it harder on AT developers to  communicate since  they don't have a standard to follow, but it is possible to have  combinations of software  that work together. For that reason -- it's not absolutely impossible --  I think that  conformance should be possible in case 2.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    The CSS WG was kind enough to allow Gregory and me to  discuss some user interface questions about CSS3. Below is  a quick summary of the discussion, with some action  items highlighted for UAWG/WAI PF follow-up.     1) Include a stricter requirement that a conforming user      agent allow ssers to specify user style sheets in CSS3.     a) The Working Group agreed in principle, but raised some     questions about whether this would be burdensome for small     devices. It was pointed out that the user style sheet didn't     necessarily need to reside on the mobile device (e.g., a server     could be configured to apply it on the server side). There     were other comments that exceptions due to device limitations     were already covered by "the spec". However, it doesn't seem that     there's a CSS3 module that addresses user style sheets (so no     place to include this requirement yet).      b) Suggested requirements:       i) A conforming user agent must allow users to         apply user style sheets. [Authoring them not required, but        possibly required for an authoring tool.]      ii) A conforming user agent must allow users to turn        off author and user style sheets.          Note: The WG said "Users need to turn off         author and user style sheets even in the XML case?" to which        we replied that both functionalities (turning off user        and author styles) were useful independently, and therefore        both needed to be implemented. It was not a problem that,        in some cases, the user might not find useful turning off all        author and user style sheets (leaving only UA default styles).           iii) A conforming user agent must allow users to select        from available alternative style sheets.    ACTION: The CSS WG would like WAI PF to make a formal proposal          for what requirements about selection of user/author          style sheets should be in CSS3.    2) Will CSS3 have a :selection pseudo-class?     Answer: yes (in the UI module [1]). However, the WG does not     anticipate making the selection stylable according to the     full range of visual styles (this is in line with the     UAWG's own expectations about not requiring font size changes     for selected text). The CSS WG had not anticipated making     the selection stylable for audio/speech output and agreed     in principle to add ACCS properties to the spec.       We also asked whether the CSS WG was aware of whether the     DOM WG was going to implement the selection in the DOM    (the CSS WG didn't know). I think that the DOM WG does not    intend to include an API for selection (not sure, though).    The CSS WG is also interested in such an API.    ACTION: The CSS WG would like WAI PF to make a formal proposal          listing specific properties of ACSS (possible a subset          of all of them) that should be available with the          :selection pseudo-class.    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-userint    3) Device-independent property values in the UI module?     There was discussion of the device-dependent property values   in section 4.6 of CSS3 UI module [1] (e.g., 'hover-checkbox-on').   People agreed that:     a) It was a good thing to remove device-dependent information      from format specs.     b) The CSS spec should use device-independent properties/values      when genericity is cal     c) It was ok to have device-dependent values for media-specific      rendering.     Conclusion: The CSS3 spec seems ok as is.    4) Keyboard bindings (key-equivalent, tab-index).     We said that the HTML 4 keyboard access model was broken.   The CSS WG asked for a URI to documentation of the fact   that it's broken.     Here's one (from w3c-wai-ua):     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0017.html     We asked how much coordination had been done between DOM WG,   CSS WG, and WAI PF. Not much had been done.     It is not certain that the CSS3 modules will fix the model, but there   may be some benefits by moving it to CSS (e.g., the cascade).     There was discussion of the need for "modes" in a keyboard   access model (to be able to reuse characters since there are   a limited number of single keys).      ACTION: The CSS WG would like WAI PF to document how the HTML          keyboard access model is broken. Also, some coordination          should be done with DOM/CSS/WAI PF about keyboard          models.                5) Status report on behaviors module.      There was mention of the recent "XBL - XML Binding Language 1.0"    Submission [3]. It seems like there may be movement    around this module again. There was also mention of UIML (but not    much mention).      [3] http://www.w3.org/Submission/2001/05/    6) Status report on ACSS module.      Not much happening here (and the WG didn't know of any    implementations other than emacspeak). There seems to be growing    interest in getting ACSS implemented in a major browser.  Also,    there was some discussion about how ACSS should not just be for    speech-only or audio-only output; it should be used (and useful) in    visual-plus-speech environments.        Is the Voice WG to take over this work? Apparently not.    The Voice WG does not seem to be moving in the direction of writing    specs where content styled for voice input and speech    output. Instead, they are using a model where they are representing    already-styled content (this is a rough summary of Chris Lilley's    assessment of the Voice WG's work).    7) Authoring requirements?      Daniel Glazman (Netscape) asked whether we had any suggestions    for the Composer developers with respect to CSS.     We mentioned the ability to author with one style sheet and    publish with another, and we pointed them to the ATAG 1.0.    8) Styling properties for time-dependent content.      We asked whether CSS should include properties for time control    of time-dependent content. There is already a property for    controlling speech playback rate, what about video and animations?     We agreed that specific WGs (e.g., SYMM) should come up with     properties and values they needed, but that these should be     integrated into the common formatting properties. Having these    properties in CSS rather than in each individual format    has advantages such as the cascade, styling through selectors,     etc.    9) Ruby      We didn't really discuss Ruby, but acknowledged that it would    be a useful mechanism for authoring text annotations.    10) Same requirements for XSL as for CSS?      The CSS WG asked whether we had approached the XSL WG with    these same requirements. We said we had not yet, but that was    a good idea.    11) Mention of accessibility features in the CSS specs.      We didn't address this topic: getting the CSS spec itself    to include text such as "This feature is known to be     useful to users with disabilities for the following reasons..."    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

This one is meant for developers  (to understand what features to implement) and authors  who are not necessarily using authoring tools to produce SMIL.    > 3.

This would  be appropriate for a general SMIL tutorial or FAQ and I'm sure  that a tutorial would help all audiences. However, including  this level of detail in this Note might dilute the accessibility  points we hope to communicate.    > 4.

However, in editing, we lost the  context that justified this transition.

      Dear Working Group,    Congratulations! The UAAG 1.0 has entered its (third) last  call review. Below is a copy of the email I just sent to  the W3C Chairs list.    Now we get to start thinking about the implementation report,  so I encourage you to start documenting as precisely as possible  how different user agents satisfy the requirements of the   document. Please send your reports to this list.    Thank you,     - Ian    ----  On behalf of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working  Group (UAWG) [1], I am pleased to announce the publication of the  9 April 2001 "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" (UAAG 1.0)  last call Working Draft. The document is available at:             http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-UAAG10-20010409/    The last call review period ends 4 May 2001. Please send review  comments before that date to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org (archives [2]).  The UAWG has scheduled this review period based on comments  received as a result of our request to the Chairs [3, W3C Members  only].    The UAWG also encourages review of the 9 April 2001 "Techniques  for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" Working Draft, even  though this document is not in last call. The UAWG expects to  publish the Techniques document as a companion W3C Note should  UAAG 1.0 become a W3C Recommendation. This Techniques document is  available at:             http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010409/    Please find below the following information:       * W3C Groups we wish to review the document    * Documentation of the decision to go to last call    * Objections    * Request for implementation reports    * The abstract and status sections of UAAG 1.0     * The abstract of the Techniques document    I look forward to your review comments,     - Ian Jacobs, W3C     Team Contact for the UAWG    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2001JanMar/0127    =======================  Dependencies and review  =======================    While the UAWG welcomes review from all interested parties, we  request review specifically from the following W3C groups:      Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines WG    CSS/FP WG    Device Independent WG    DOM WG    HTML WG    Internationalization WG/IG    Mobile Access     Protocols and Formats WG    SYMM WG    Voice Browser WG    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WG    The W3C Director will appreciate a response (sent to  w3c-wai-ua@w3.org), with or without review comments.    ===========================  Decision to go to last call  ===========================    At their 29 March 2001 teleconference [4], the User Agent  Guidelines Working Group decided to move the UA Guidelines to its  third last call.  By moving to last call, the UAWG indicates that  it is seeking feedback from the larger Web community about this  document, especially from other W3C Working Groups. The UAWG  intends for this document to become a W3C Recommendation, per the  Working Group's charter [5].    Please note that this is the third last call for the  document. While the UAWG encourages rigorous review of the  document, we do not expect to make substantial changes, other  than clarifications, to UAAG 1.0. We expect to add proposals for  additional features or requirements to our agenda for future  work. Similarly, the Working Group does not expect to re-open old  issues (e.g., checkpoint priorities) except if presented with  substantial new information.    The UAWG's complete issues lists ([6a], [6b]) are available. We  encourage you to consult them prior to raising a substantial  issue.  The list of changes [7] to UAAG 1.0 and the Techniques  document is also available.

Links to responses to reviewers are  available on the Working Group's deliverables history page [8].    [8] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/Deliverables    Two reviewers requested that their objections be carried forward  with this call for review. Both objections concern the priority  of checkpoint 12.1:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0528    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0553    There was also one objection held over from the previous round of  reviews (though this objection was not reconfirmed by the  dissenters):      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0178    Other objections have become moot as a result of changes to the  document and will not be carried forward:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0110    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0111    =================================  Implementation reports encouraged  =================================    The UAWG encourages all last call reviewers to document  implementations known to satisfy the checkpoints.  This  information will help the UAWG prepare an implementation report  for presentation to the Director should the document advance to  the next stage of the Recommendation process.    The suggested approach for documenting which user agents (or  combinations of user agents) satisfy the checkpoints is to follow  the procedures outlined in section "3. Conformance" [9]. (By  following these procedures, you will help us verify the usability  of this section of the document.) We encourage you to use the  checklist appendix [10] as an evaluation tool.    Please send your implementation reports to w3c-wai-ua (or, if you  wish your evaluation to remain confidential within the W3C Team,  to wai-ua-review@w3.org).

User agents include   HTML browsers and other types of software that retrieve and   render Web content. A user agent that conforms to these   guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user   interface and through other internal facilities, including its   ability to communicate with other technologies (especially   assistive technologies). Furthermore, all users, not just users   with disabilities, are expected to find conforming user agents   to be more usable.     In addition to helping developers of HTML browsers, media   players, etc., this document will also benefit developers of   assistive technologies because it explains what types of   information and control an assistive technology may expect from   a conforming user agent. Technologies not addressed directly by   this document (e.g., technologies for braille rendering) will be   essential to ensuring Web access for some users with   disabilities.    ==========================  Status section of UAAG 1.0  ==========================     This is the 9 April 2001 last call Working Draft of the "User   Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0". This last call review   period ends 4 May 2001. Please send comments before the review   period ends to the public mailing list w3c-wai-ua@w3.org; public   archives are available.     This is the third last call for comments on "User Agent   Accessibility Guidelines 1.0". The previous formally published   version of this document was the 23 October 2000 last call   Working Draft, for which the review period ended 13 November   2000. Since that date, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines   Working Group (UAWG) has clarified the document and addressed   the issues raised during the (second) last call. There have been   ten (public) Working Group drafts since the end of the second   last call review period. At their 29 March 2001 teleconference,   the Working Group decided to advance the revised document to a   third last call.     A list of changes to this document is available.     To help the Working Group compose an implementation report (as   part of advancing the document on the W3C Recommendation track),   reviewers are encouraged to evaluate software and to report   (e.g., by filling out a checklist [UAAG10-CHECKLIST]) how that   software satisfies the requirements of the document.     Publication as a Working Draft does not imply endorsement by the   W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated,   replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is   inappropriate to cite W3C Working Drafts as other than "work in   progress."     This document is part of a series of accessibility documents   published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World   Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WAI Accessibility Guidelines are   produced as part of the WAI Technical Activity. The goals of the   User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group are described   in the charter.     A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical   documents can be found at the W3C Web site.    ===================================  Abstract of Techniques for UAAG 1.0  ===================================     This document provides techniques for satisfying the checkpoints   defined in "Techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines   1.0" [UAAG10]. These techniques cover the accessibility of user   interfaces, content rendering, application programming   interfaces (APIs), and languages such as the Hypertext Markup   Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and the   Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    At the 15 March 2001 teleconference [1], I received an action  item to clarify the meaning of checkpoint 2.9 in the 9 March 2001  draft [2]. The checkpoint reads:      "2.9 Allow configuration to create the conditions under which    conditional content is rendered.  [Priority 3]"    To understand the intention of this checkpoint, here's an example  from the HTML 4.01 specification: when to render "alt" for the  IMG element. The HTML 4.01 specification states:      "The alt attribute specifies alternate text that is rendered    when the image cannot be displayed (see below for information    on how to specify alternate text ). User agents must render    alternate text when they cannot support images, they cannot    support a certain image type or when they are configured not to    display images."    In this case, there are three conditions under which a conforming  user agent must render alt instead of the image:     1) Images not supported   2) Image type not supported   3) Configured not to display images    I think our intention was not really to simulate one or more of  these conditions (why simulate lack of support for a particular  image type?), but rather to achieve the result of any one of  these conditions: that alt be rendered instead of IMG.    While checkpoint 2.3 is about element-level rendering control, I  think that checkpoint 2.9 is about global configuration so that  content that would only be rendered automatically under certain  conditions (per checkpoint 2.1) is rendered automatically,  whatever the current conditions.    Specs may not say much about when or how to render  conditional content.     a) The specification might say nothing about rendering conditions      (the case for "title" or "longdesc" in HTML, for example).     b) The specification might define rendering conditions, but not      how to render (one could argue that "alt" falls into this       category).     c) The specification might define both the rendering conditions      and how to render (I think OBJECT in HTML falls into this case,      and probably SMIL test attributes do as well).    Checkpoint 2.3 takes all three into account. It may therefore be  helpful to define 2.9 in terms of 2.3.    --------  PROPOSAL  --------      "2.9 Allow configuration so that the conditional content    rendering mechanisms used to satisfy checkpoint 2.3 are applied    automatically. [Priority 3]"         Note: For example, suppose an HTML user agent satisfies       checkpoint 2.3 by allowing the user to replace each IMG       element individually with its associated "alt" attribute. As       part of satisfying the current checkpoint, the user agent       might allow configuration to render no IMG elements and       instead to render their associated "alt" attributes.      Furthermore, we can clarify 2.3 by adding examples to    the Note (which we used to have, in fact), as in:         Note: This checkpoint requires "element level" user control       of rendering. For instance, an HTML user agent might satisfy       this checkpoint by allowing the user to select each IMG       element and to replace it on demand with the text of its       "alt" attribute. Or, the user agent might render the "alt"       text in addition to the element. Or the user agent might       allow the user to query the element for both the "alt" and       "longdesc" values (and to allow the user to retrieve the       longdesc" resource). The configuration requirement of this       checkpoint is global: the user agent is only required to       provide one switch that turns on or off these element-level       rendering mechanisms.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0427  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Now consider the following: the markup was illegal, so the  user agent has to do some repair. Is the Web content what  the UA received over the wire, or what the result of the  repair is?    In UAAG 1.0, we ended up saying: content is generally  what the user agent retrieves, but it may be subject to  repair. We are interested in the result, which is the  document object.     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783        

      Madeleine,    Today we discussed issue #271 [1] (refer to minutes [2]). The issue  concerns the priority of checkpoint 4.7.     We discussed the feasibility of implementing arbitrary positioning  and people agreed that there didn't seem to be anything technically   impossible about allowing users to select where captions, etc.   should be rendered (notably when the markup language or style   sheet language allows the author to position content arbitrarily).     We also discussed the rationale: for which users was this a   P1 requirement and would arbitrary positioning really address  their needs. (Refer also to Al Gilman's comments on  "How much positioning control for captions etc.?" [3]).    Rich Schwerdtfeger asked for comments from you about what you  think the priority of this checkpoint should be.     Thank you,     - Ian    P.S. Comments from others are also welcome.

My understanding is that a client-side redirect requires no user  input; after a time-delay, the user agent GETs a new page. Sometimes,  the content that is available during the time-delay allows the user to  manually GET the new content.

REFERENCE DOCUMENT:  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-USERAGENT-19990331     I would offer that this scenario is covered by checkpoint  4.2.1 [Priority 1]:                Ensure that all functionalities offered by                 the user agent interface are available through all                supported input devices. These include the installation                 procedure, access to documentation,                and software configuration.     Activating a menu (be it in the document or in the tool) I think  is part of the user interface functionality.    I think your example illustrates one particular need well and  would be useful as an example.    I therefore propose that we don't add a checkpoint but that  we add the example to the document.     - Ian

Jonathan,    W3C recognizes the general need for less technical materials  for the general public. This applies not just to WAI but to all  of the work we do. We are looking for technical writers (although  we don't yet have the job descriptions ready) for this type of  work.    The Accessibility Notes (on SMIL, CSS, and HTML, and upcoming  on XML and SVG) are a step in this direction.     I suspect that this discussion belongs on EO, so I am adding them  to the thread. I am also cc'ing your comments to the W3C  Communications Team.

      10 May 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0114    Reference document 11 April 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/    Minutes of previous meeting 3 May:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0108    Next meetings:   May 16 (extra), 17, 18 (extra)    Present:    Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (scribe), Harvey Bingham,    Jim Allan, Tim Lacy, Gregory Rosmaita, Mickey Quenzer,   Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets: David Poehlman, Eric Hansen  Absent:  Denis Anson    Note: As of this call, I'm going to drop Charles McCathieNevile  as an active attendee of the teleconference.    -------------  Announcements  -------------    Scheduling extra last call teleconfs:      Wednesday, May 16: 2:00-4:30 EST    Thursday, May 17th: 2:00-4:00 EST (regular meeting time)    Friday, May 18th: 2:00-4:00 EST      Wednesday, May 23th, 2:00-4:30 EST    Thursday, May 24th: 2:00-4:00 (regular meeting time)    Friday, May 25th: 1:00-3:30 EST    HB: I have a conflict on the Weds.  JG: I wish to move 18 May meeting to 2-4pm ET  JA: I'm out of town on the 18th anyway.  TL: I might have to leave early on the 18th  IJ: I'm ok with proposed schedule.  MQ: Shouldn't be a problem for me.    ----------  Discussion  ----------    1) Comments resulting from review with Tantek Celik.     (Refer also to Eric Hansen followup on these proposals. HB, MQ,      and JG have skimmed proposals).    -------  Part I:  -------     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0073    1) "Start" events are more important than "End" events.    GR: If down produces a submenu, then I need to continue to drag  into the submenu.    IJ: The argument is that the user using manual triggering should  not have *more* than what the user of the device can do.    GR: I still need to hold the mouse down.    Resolved:     - The simulation required by 1.2 does not exceed that which     is possible with the native device.    2) Render according to spec. Do other checkpoints override this?    Resolved:     - Accept proposal that other UAAG 1.0 requirements may      override 2.1 if the format specs otherwise forbid them.     - Mention that configuration is a possibility here (break     conformance to other spec / don't).    3) Checkpoint 2.2: Define text format more formally.    Resolved:      - Adopt proposal to change checkpoint 2.2 to define exactly what   we mean by text formats for this document (i.e., the minimal   requirement).    4) Checkpoint 2.3: Scope of "alert" requirement.    IJ: Is this a global requirement or element-level? I would note  that if every page has conditional content, the alert message for  every resource is not very useful. It doesn't tell you anything  "new".     GR: I think that a global-only alert is not very useful.    IJ: Think of a links view of a document. One could also provide  a similar interface for conditional content.    MQ: It sounds like the minimal requirement is to make available  the list (possibly empty) of sources of conditional content.    IJ: People have also asked that 2.3 be broken down into simpler  pieces.    IJ: My question is: is a menu sufficient (that some time can be  empty)?     GR: What happens when I go through the conditional content menu,  then to the document, then back to the conditional content menu,  where do I start from? I probably want some persistence in that  menu.    Resolved:     - No alert is necessary when conditional content is rendered as      part of sastisfying 2.3.     - When required (for query approach), alert must be element     level.      (IJ notes that this breakdown may allow simplification of 2.3).     Techniques:       - A global alert that then allows one to find out more would       be useful.     - The WG thinks that a "conditional content list" approach       would satisfy the checkpoint.     - Should be able to find one's place in context (in a "main"       view).    GR: Check out JFW and Amaya for orientation between views,  possibly Opera too.    /* Tim leaves */    5) Configuration not required when the user agent always or     never does something?    IJ: The question is: what are the accessibility issues  if some stuff is "always on".    MQ: E.g., I might want to be able to turn off captions otherwise  they will always be "in my way" (even when I don't want them).    /* Brief discussion of blink rate control */    IJ: We need to clarify whether configuration is also part of the  requirement (not just the functionality being configured).    GR: I think that applicability is relevant for 3.3.    IJ: I note then, that configuration is in most cases as important  as the functionality being configured. But I don't know whether  it's as important in all cases (where there is binary  configuration).    NO RESOLUTION.    6) Checkpoint 2.9: Automatic rendering of all conditional content     at once required?    (First part)    Proposed:     - Adopt proposal that "The user agent may satisfy checkpoint 2.9   by allowing different configurations to render different types   of conditional content automatically, possibly in different   viewports."    NO RESOLUTION.    -------  Actions  -------    ------  Closed  ------    7.GR: support for NOSCRIPT lynx longdesc - webspeak, HPR  JA: See minutes of previous meeting.    ----  Open  ----    1.IJ: Edit the text of checkpoints 2.1, 2.2, 8.1, and 8.2 so that UAs   are not required to conform for all formats that are implemented.

They are slightly different. 11.2 requires that accessibility  features be documented somewhere (the more important requirement).   11.4 requires a specific section (e.g., entitled "Accessibility  Features") where all features are listed.     Perhaps a clarifying note to 11.4 would be helpful:       "For example, list all pertinent features in a chapter      entitled "Accessibility Features". Note that this is a more     specific requirement than checkpoint 11.2.     > 13.

A panner is, for me, a window over content  that you can move around to view different parts of the content.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

"accesskey" is the HTML method for authors to   specify key bindings.  There may be other ways in other languages. Also,  "Behavioral Extensions to CSS" suggests using a selector mechanism  for assigning script handlers to element/event combinations.    We can mention accesskey and tabindex explicitly after the main  checkpoint text.

Otherwise I am not sure how it is different from checkpoints >2.2 and 2.3    This checkpoint means "Show users keyboard bindings by using standard  OS approaches, such as underlining letters in menu entries to indicate  the key used to activate the menu.     I propose this rewrite:           Use platform conventions to indicate which keys         activate which user agent functionalities.            For example, on some platforms,            if a functionality is available from a menu, the            letter of the key that will activate that functionality is             underlined.    > Checkpoint 2.8 Provide a default keyboard configuration for frequently performed operations. [Priority 3]   > JRG: Seems redundant with checkpoint 2.1 and related to 2.4.  Its relationship  >to 2.4 seems to be that if the user can configure, part of that should be able to >return to the default settings.  I would suggest combining the two checkpoints    I don't think it's redundant - this one says "provide a useful default  configuration", which is separate from "ensure that all functionalities  are available from the keyboard" and "allow customization of the  keyboard". There may be ways to combine this one with other checkpoints,  but I don't see the need.    >JRG: Would like to add a checkpoint related to turning on or off the rendering of >tables at a priority 3.    Do you mean not having tables rendered at all ('display:none') or   having tables rendered linearly? I'm pretty sure we've resolved  the table linearization issue (by requiring that dependent UAs permit  table cell navigation and requiring that all UAs give access to  content for selected elements, including table cells). My comment  supposes that the issue is access to cell content. Is there another  issue that has to do with simplifying layout?    > JRG: Checkpoint 6.12 should be priority one for people with hearing loss    I propose that this checkpoint be dropped. Volume is controlled  by the knob on the speaker or at the OS level.    > JRG: Checkpoint 7.12 Seems to be linked to the checkpoint,   > 9.16...    I agree. In the recent proposal for checkpoints of Guideline 9 [2],  there is a checkpoint requiring UAs to make available information  that will enable users to decide whether to follow a link. I agree with  you that 7.12 and 9.16 should be merged and I believe merged with  the 9.5 proposed in [2].

      Hello,    Per my action assigned 30 November at the ATAG teleconf, here is  a definition of "applicability" that is short.  It differs from the UAGL definition (as of the last  call draft) in that it relies on common sense, not a series of   specific cases of non-applicability.    <DFN>  Applicable checkpoint      Some checkpoints may not apply to certain classes of     authoring tools. Common sense dictates whether the     requirements of a checkpoint exceed the scope of the tool's    design. Checkpoints that require a tool to     implement a functionality are applicable to the tool. However,     some examples of where a checkpoint might not    apply include: the authoring tool does not recognize or     support a markup language or markup language feature,     the authoring tool does not support a particular content type, and    the authoring tool does not control the properties of an embedded    object.  </DFN>    Note that this definition should  also be accompanied by a change to the conformance statement  that says that authoring tools only need to satisfy applicable  checkpoints.     - Ian    P.S. I have cc'd the UAGL WG in case people in that WG   find this definition more useful for UAGL as well.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    Per my action item of 2 May [1], please consider this  proposed rewording for checkpoint 7.6 (about structured   navigation).    [1]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/wai-ua-telecon-20000502.html#minutes    <OLD>  7.6 Allow the user to navigate according to structure. [Priority 2]          For example, allow the user to navigate familiar elements          of a document: document headings, paragraphs, tables and         table cells, lists, etc. Note. Use operating system         conventions to indicate navigation progress (e.g.,          selection or content focus).   </OLD>    <NEW>  7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among      important pieces of content identified by the       author. [Priority 2]          User agents should allow users to:        1) Navigate to a piece of content that the           author has identified as important according           to the markup language specification and           conventional usage. In HTML, for example,           this includes headings, forms, tables, navigation           mechanisms, and lists.        2) Navigate past that piece of content (i.e.,           avoid the details of that component).        3) Navigate into that piece of content (i.e.,           chose to view the details of that component).          Structured navigation is most effective when available in        conjunction with a configurable view (checkpoints 8.5 and        8.6). Users should be able to navigate to important         pieces of content within a configurable view, identify        the type of object they have navigated to, interact with        that object easily (if its an active element), and recall        the surrounding context (orient themselves).  </NEW>    Techniques (in conjunction with the existing techniques and              those mentioned in the References listed below).       User agents should construct the navigation view with the goal     of breaking onolithic content into sensible pieces according to     the author's design. In most cases, user agents should not break     down content into individual elements for navigation; element     by element navigation of the document object does not meet the       goal of facilitating navigation to important pieces of content.       Instead, user agents are expected to construct the navigation     view from author-supplied markup. For those languages with     known conventions for identifying important components, user     agents should construct the navigation tree from those components,     allowing users to navigate to them, skip them, or navigate into them.     In HTML, important elements including headings, tables, forms,     DIV elements (notably with a "title" attribute set), navigation     mechanisms (marked up with MAP), and lists.      HTML also allows authors to specify keyboard configurations     (accesskey, tabindes), which can serve as hints about what the     author considers important. Tables and forms illustrate the     utility of a recursive navigation mechanism. The user should be     able to navigate to tables, then change "scope" and navigate within     the cells of that table. Nested tables fit nicely within this     scheme. The same ideas apply to forms: users should be able to     navigate to a form, then among the controls within that form.       In SVG, the "g" element signifies a grouping and should be considered     when constructing the navigation view. In SMIL, "par", "seq",     and "switch" provide information that may be useful for identifying     significant components of content.       Users should be able to configure the navigation view as they     go, expanding and contracting portions of content that they     wish to examine or ignore. This will speed up navigation     and promote orientation at the same time.    Notes:     - The term "important" is used in WCAG 1.0 [2]:     "Information in a document is important if understanding       that information is crucial to understanding the document."     This is not quite the meaning intended here, I believe.      As I have understood the WG's discussions, the goal is to be     able to reach "blocks" of content, not "information" that     is semantically important. We might assume that blocks of     content are generally semantically important, but that cannot     be guaranteed. For instance "DIV" may be used purely to     provide a green background to some content, and DIV is a block     element.      [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#glossary     - This checkpoint looks a lot like the "chunk navigation" checkpoint     we used to have, though this one is a little more general.

      Hi Amir,    Thank you for answering my question. I am looking at the 9 June  draft of the Micropayment Markup spec [1], in section 4.5, which  I believe to be the pertinent section. Some comments:    1) The current text begins:        "The price parameter, which takes a character string,       displays the amount and currency to the Customer."       I propose that this be changed to:        "The price parameter, which takes a character string,       specifies the amount and currency that the Customer       will be charged upon dereferencing the link."       (Question: How does caching work? Is this dealt with elsewhere?      I'm sorry if this is not a pertinent question.)    2) Perhaps there should be a reserved value for non-fee links.     For example, "0", with no currency specified. This would be     more international than "free", for example.    Please let me know if these comments make sense. Thank you  again,      - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-Micropayment-Markup-19990609     amir.herzberg@il.ibm.com wrote:  >   > Ian says,  >   > > There's a dependency between User Agent (Accessibility  > > Guidelines) and Micropayments: users agents must be able  > > to indicate to users that following a link will require  > > them to pay a fee.

I believe we have clearly chosen to move away from the offscreen  model world, and our DOM and other standard API requirements state  so clearly. Do we need to say more?    In the 7 July Guidelines (and other versions) we say at the end of 1.2:     <BLOCKQUOTE>  So that desktop browsers can make information available   to assistive technologies, they must communicate through  standard interfaces. An architecture that makes possible   programmatic access to content and the user interface will  benefit assistive technologies, scripting tools, and   automated test engines. It will also promote software   modularity and reuse.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    Furthermore, we say in section 1.7 (Conformance:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Note: These guidelines aim to make conforming user agents  accessible. This includes the accessibility of the user   agent's user interface in addition to the accessibility   of Web content. When used in conjunction with assistive   technology, conforming user agents are expected to be  accessible to most users with disabilities; in some cases,  accessibility is "completed" by the use of an assistive technology.  Some user agents may not conform to these guidelines but still be  accessible to some users with disabilities.  By following the principles of this document,  developers of all user agents (not just conforming user  agents) should improve the accessibility of their products.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    Should we state that we expect ATs to implement the  standard interfaces required by the document?    In Guideline 5, we state:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Using interoperable APIs and following system c  onventions increases predictability for users  and for developers of assistive technologies.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    We might also say something there.    I don't think we need to add anything to the document,  but we could make an additional statement if the WG  wishes.     _ Ian     > Charles  >   > On Wed, 26 Jul 2000, Denis Anson wrote:  >   >   I don't think we can make any "requirements" to the AT vendors.

But asking user  agents to recognize classes that are not defined in the HTML  specification  is problematic to me. It could be done - the UA Guidelines could require  that conforming user agents handle some predefined classes in a special  way - but I think that the HTML spec is the appropriate place for this  type of information.    > 3. defining conventions for titles  (well, I gotta have a third alternative)    <grin>      > As you might guess, my vote is for 2, defining conventions for class  > names.

Here's a nice HTML trick that works with Lynx:  Define links to key parts of a page with the LINK element        <link rel="start" href="#headline" title="Go to headline |"/>      <link rel="contents" href="#contents" title="Go to table of contents  |"/>      <link rel="index" href="#search" title="Search"/>       Lynx renders these as links, but they do not show up on most     graphical browsers. Thus the author can create skip-over links     even if the UA doesn't support structured navigation to or     past groups of links.     - Ian         > Note that even if we wait for XML, that just postpones deciding on the  > semantic units.

      Hello,    Checkpoint 9.4 of the Proposed Recommendation [1] reads:      9.4 When loading content (e.g., document, image, audio,        video, etc.) indicate what proportion of the content has         loaded and whether loading has stalled. [Priority 3]     We do not have a definition of "load". I believe that  this means "to put in the viewport", i.e., to render, rather  than retrieve (although delays in loading may be due  to delays in retrieval initially). I therefore propose  the following restatement of the requirement:    <NEW>    9.4 When rendering content (e.g., document, image, audio,        video, etc.), indicate what proportion of the content has         been rendered and whether rendering has stalled. [Priority 3]   </NEW>    We do have a definition of "rendered content".      Note:   There is still a slight ambiguity, but I propose to not worry  about it. The proportion (e.g., percentage) should probably  represent the proportion of currently rendered content to the  total rendered content. However, user agents that render   incrementally may not know how much total rendered content   there will be. An approximation based on the byte-size of   the document source would be adequate. Document entity   length may be known in advance (e.g., through the   "Content-Length entity-header field in HTTP/1.1 [2],   section 14.13). If I've misquoted the HTTP spec, please let  me know.      - Ian    P.S. I am proposing this change in an effort to harmonize our  use of "content" in the document.

      Hello,    In the 9 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 [1], we refer to "single key" bindings  in checkpoint 11.3 (we also refer to "modifier keys"). I think we  need to clarify that this refers to actual physical keys on a keyboard,  not signals sent by the hardware. The accessibility requirement involves  limited physical movement.     I would also note that I do not believe that there are any  internationalization issues here. On systems where a user must  use several keystrokes to compose a single (abstract) character, we  still want single-physical-key access for users.    Therefore I propose clarifying in checkpoint 11.3 that when  we talk about "keys" we are referring to physical keys.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

For the record, the old text is:          Provide programmatic notification of changes to content and user        interface controls (including selection, content focus, and        user interface focus).    I actually don't think the old text suggests that ATs can't control  what they want. The notification is provided, and the recipient can  do whatever they want with the information.     It sounds like there are two options:     - Allow (programmatic) configuration of what      notifications are made programmatically.     - Don't allow configuration, but the AT can always ignore any     notification it doesn't want.    I think I would prefer the latter, but I would welcome input from  AT vendors here!     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Jonathan,    The two files you enclosed are two versions of the home page.  The one labeled "ie5.html" is the version prior to 24 August. The one  labeled "netscape4.7" is the one we installed on 24 August.     As I said in my previous email, we may have a mirroring problem  if you are getting two files served differently. Or, you may simply  have copied the files before and after we made the change to the home   page.     I have run a command on the Web server that I hope ensures  that the home page has been mirrored correctly. I recommend that  you point your browsers at http://www.w3.org/ and try again.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Why does it belong in the section on device independence? Is this  about user agents *generating* text from audio? Or about ensuring  that author-supplied text is available?     Or does "audio" mean "speech"?    Before adding to the document, I need some clarification.    Thank you,     - Ian    [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0083.html        

      Hello,    To address issue 474 [1], I sent a proposal [2] that was discussed  somewhat at the 10 May teleconference [3] with no resolution. The  question is: Is configuration required when the user agent  always/never does something anyway?    Summary: I believe the Working Group should consider that,  for the following checkpoints, configuration is not always  required as long as the user agent satisfies the required  functionality: 3.3, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6.    For the other checkpoints, I think that configuration is probably  necessary all the time. Details follow.    I reviewed the checkpoints of the 25 May draft [4] to find out:     a) Which checkpoints include configuration requirements.   b) Of these checkpoints, which require a "binary" configuration      (as opposed to a multi-valued configuration such as selecting       from among available colors).   c) Of these, in which case is the checkpoint really intended      to address user needs in both states. In other words, each      configuration checkpoint has two parts: the functionality      being configured, and configuration itself. I think that      in most cases, both configurability and the functionality      itself are more or less equally important. In some cases,       however, configurability is not nearly as important as      the functionality itself.    Here are the results of my read:    a) Checkpoints that require configuration:       G2: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10     G3: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7     G4: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.9, 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16     G5: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7     G9: 9.5, 9.10    G10: 10.2, 10.4    G11: 11.4, 11.7    b) Of these, the following involve a binary requirement:       G2: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10     G3: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7     G5: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7     G9: 9.5    c) Of these, I think that in the following cases,      configuration is about as important as the functionality     itself (at the same Priority, though not necessarily for     the same users):       2.3 Render conditional content.          Rationale: If conditional content rendered at same time,         this might be confusing.       2.4 Allow time-independent interaction.         Rationale: If presentation always stops, this might be         confusing or cause usability problems.       2.5 Make captions, transcripts available.         Rationale: Same as for 2.3.        2.7 Repair missing content.         Rationale: I don't think any repair functionality         should be on all the time.       2.10 Alert unsupported language.          Rationale: I don't think any repair functionality          should be on all the time.       Checkpoints: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7          - In almost all cases, I think it's probably as important          to most users that this content be processed according to         spec as it is to some users that they have manual         control. For instance, I imagine that it's a big burden         to some users to have to click on every placeholder to         get an image to be rendered         - The one exception I could see is checkpoint 3.3: I am not         convinced that blinking text is a P1 requirement. I'm not         so sure about animated text.      5.2 Keep viewport on top.        Rationale: I think it would be frustrating to most users        if they could not bring viewports easily to the foreground.      9.5 Move focus without activation.         Rationale: I think this may make pages unusable to many        users, so the user needs to be able to have focus changes        trigger focus handlers automatically.    d) This leaves the following checkpoints. I think that it may     be ok if the user agent doesn't allow configuration in these     cases, as long as the functionality is enabled:      3.3 Toggle animated/blinking text.         Comment: I think it's ok if the user agent never blinks;                 not sure about animated text.      5.1 No automatic content focus change.    5.3 Manual viewport open only.         Comment: I think that it may be ok if the user never changes        focus automatically, or never opens viewports except on        explicit user request. However, one could argue that for some         users (e.g., with a physical disability), that the manual        opening is a burden.          5.5 Confirm form submission.     5.6 Confirm fee links.        Comment: I think that it's probably ok if the user agent        always prompts, although it might be annoying (but that's        a low priority).     - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#474  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0073  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0127   [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010525/    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

(and [4]belated         announcement on chairs).       * The public [5]IRC log of the meeting.       There is no next meeting scheduled; discussion will take place on the     [6]spec-prod list ([7]archive). Deadline for action items is 12     September.       Scribe Note: Some of the links on this page are to Member-only     information.    Participants       Janet Daly, Max Froumentin, Paul Grosso, Max Froumentin, Eduardo     Gutentag, Hugo Haas, Patrick Ion, Ian Jacobs (Chair/Scribe), Susan     Lesch, Philippe Le H?garet, Arnaud Le Hors, Eve Maler, Norm Walsh.     Also, Karl Best (briefly).       Chair Note: The bridge was full at the beginning of the call as the     previous Working Group's teleconference ended. I apologize to those     who missed the call because they were not able to join the call  during     the first few minutes.    Discussion       Scribe Note: I've organized the minutes according to publication     scenarios, not based on the order of comments.      Direct publication of XML documents       PG: We can distinguish two cases:      1. Publishing XML documents directly with a canonical style sheet.      2. Using XML as a source format for generating other formats, and  not         requiring that the source XML be readily publishable with a         canonical style sheet.       PG: Documentation of processes and policies for naming, content     negotiation, etc. when publishing html generated from xml, or when     publishing xml directly. (Some issues that arose during publication  of     XML 1.0 second edition).      Tools people are using       For validation:            The [8]W3C "comma tools" (for validation of HTML, CSS, link            checking, etc.)       For generation of html from an xml or xhtml source:              + DOM WG: DOM scripts (in Java) for generating html, chunking.              Refer to [9]DOM Editors notes for details.            + WAI WGs, HTML 4, CSS 2: Perl scripts. These are undocumented              (hence this whole project!).            + Other WGs: XSLT style sheet (refer to [10]XMLspec Processing              Applications).            + [11]xalan (java tool for transforming XML documents into              HTML, text, or other XML document types).              EM: Do people expect to continue to author in xhtml and  convert            each time to XMLSpec, or to convert once to XMLspec and            continue from there? Conversion strategies will differ            depending on what your goals are in this regard. I recommend            optimizing for one-time conversion.       For PDF/PS generation              + WAI WGs: html2ps, ps2pdf            + MathML: xslt to produce TeX, then PDFTeX.            + [12]FOP (XSL FO to PDF), [13]PassiveTeX (XSL to PDF through              TeX), [14]Epic, tool from Oracle.              MF: I'm working on tools to generate XSL FO's from XMLSpec.              I've had some problems getting FOP (XSL FOs to PDF) to work              on documents larger than 10 pages.              NW: There are ways to increase the memory limits.            + Adobe distiller              ALH: We should focus on generating PDF. Then you get PS for            free.       For text generation:            Lynx, Netscape.       For editing:            [15]Epic, [16]xed (NW to make Linux port available soon),            emacs, etc.       Scribe Note: The previous list has been gleaned from the IRC log and     does not constitute produce endorsement.      Tools people want         * EG: I want a visual xsl editor.       * EM: Canonical TR style sheet for XMLSpec       * One-stop validation, link checking, etc. for w3c editors.      Other issues raised:         * Exensibility of XMLSpec v. process for incorporating features  into         the core.         IJ: Dan Connolly does not want a centrally managed DTDs. Use         schemas.         PLH: I'd prefer not to have extensibility, but would like a  formal         process for getting something in the DTD.         EM: I think that in general people will want to extend the DTD  for         their specific needs.         NW: The reasonable way forward is to approach this as a parallel         standardization: have a core DTD + style sheet. When you want to         propose an extension, some group reviews the proposal and helps         them extend it for their needs.         PG: I'd rather people avoid extending where possible. If they're         using XML as a database (case a above), that's one thing. But if         they're using XML to publish directly, then avoid extensions.         EM: A single XML DTD will help people meet W3C [17]publication         rules. Do you prefer "late binding" (everyone can do what they         want as long as they meet pubrules) or "early binding" (if you         start with XMLSpec or some other tool provided by the W3C Comm         team, you will get a lot for free).       * There was a small amount of discussion about coordination with         other groups (Oasis, IETF) at least for the purposes of         constructive input and possibly for coordinating a core set of         reusable tools.       * Chunking and single documents, online and offline reading.    Summary of Action items       Results of all actions to be sent to [18]spec-prod. Deadline for all     action items: 12 September 2000.       * EM: Propose harmonized version of various XMLspec DTDs in use by         different WGs.         Issue: What should the core be? E.g., should it include         possibilities for DOM APIs since more than DOM WG are developing         these APIs?       * NW: Propose canonical style sheet for publishing XMLspec  documents         as W3C technical reports, based on various style sheets in         development independently. HH and NW will work together to ensure         the unified style sheet available in CVS. Please send your style         sheets to Norm at spec-prod.       * IJ: Update "[19]How to Release a W3C Technical Report" with more         information about XML processing. Clean up since some information         redundant with respect to [20]publication rules. Include  reference         to comma tools.         IJ: Those present unanimously agreed that information about         publication tools should be public.         ISSUE: spec-prod is public and so should be any home page for         information to editors. How to release a W3C tech report is         Member-only.       * JD: Talk to W3C management about securing resources for ongoing         tracking, development, and promotion of publication tools.       * EM and IJ: Encourage participation on spec-prod by other W3C         editors (e.g., by sending email to chairs).        

      Hello,    I've published the 20 December UA Guidelines [1] and  Techniques [2].    NOTE: Due to a full partition on the Web site, this document  was not made available until 21 December (in the morning). Also,  server problems seem to be preventing access at the time  I'm sending this email.    I will publish a more detailed list of changes on 21 December.  However, the primary changes include:    1) Incorporation of resolutions from the Austin meeting [3], [4]  2) Incorporation of resolutions from 15 Dec teleconf [5]  3) 3.9/3.10 Merge proposal from Jim Allan [6]  4) Lots and lots of edits to the entire document's prose based     on Eric Hansen comments and my own edits to the rationale     and glossary.  5) And of course more techniques from everyone.    I'll publish a more detailed list of changes tomorrow    There are still a few more last call review comments that I need to  process, but the issues list [7] should be quite up to date.

That is correct. In this case, the DOM is being required not  as an interface for scripts, but as an interface for  assistive technologies.     _ Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

The difference is:   - 7.3 Priority 1: Navigate active elements along with a lot of other  stuff that may     not be active (e.g., during general structural navigation).   - 7.4 Priority 2: Navigation of active elements only.    The former is P1 because it's a P1 requirement to have access to  everything. The latter is a P2 because it facilitates navigation with  additional filtering.     - Ian      > --  > Usage in headers.

      Hello,    I am sending this email to document the (minority) opinions held by  Charles McCathieNevile, Gregory Rosmaita, and Ian Jacobs about  the resolution of issue #112 [0].     ISSUE:  User agents must make known the current input configurations          (e.g., keyboard bindings) to the user. Is there a need          to distinguish author-supplied input configurations         from user preferences?    WG RESOLUTION: Yes. P1 for user-supplied configs, P2 for  author-supplied.    This resolution is reflected in checkpoints 10.1 and 10.3 of the    21 January 2000 UA Guidelines [1]. The resolution was made on    20 January 2000 [2].    MINORITY OPINION:  We do not agree that it is useful to distinguish between input  configurations (keyboard configurations, voice configurations, etc.)  that are supplied by the author and those set by the user. To the  user, it is only the end result that matters. The answers to the  following questions should not depend on whether the configuration  came from the author or the user's preferences:     -  How does my user agent work?   -  What input commands are available to me?   -  What happens when I activate them?    Some members of the Working Group have argued for two checkpoints  of differing priorities for these reasons:      1. the UA doesn't know what to expect from author-defined       UI controls, or necessarily what to do with them or where to       look for them    2. author-defined UI controls may conflict with OS and UA       UI controls / keybindings    3. documenting/exposing/supporting author-defined UI       controls could be accorded a lower priority than UA-defined       UI controls    All of the above objections have been addressed by members  of the UA WG, and techniques to expose, trigger, and provide  a cascade order for conflicting commands have been reviewed  by the WG, and incorporated into the Techniques document.    Since ultimately the user agent is the only entity (not the author,  not the user) that "knows" what the input configuration is  (after taking into account user preferences and author-supplied  configurations), we consider that it is the user agent's responsibility  to make that information known to the user. We see know reason  to distinguish in priority between author-supplied configurations  and user preferences because, to the user, they have the same weight.

      Carol,    First of all, thank you for working to make your  content more accessible!    The WCAG 1.0 logo usage policy [1] states:      "Content providers are solely responsible for the     use of these logos."    W3C doesn't certify pages as conforming to WCAG 1.0.  We may develop this type of service in the future, or  help other organizations develop such certification  programs. We are working on mechanisms and tools for  conformance evaluation. I recommend consulting the  list of evaluation tools [2] linked from the WAI  site.    I hope this helps,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools    Carol Foster wrote:  >   > Hi,  >   > May we use the Level A icon in our departmental newsletter in  > conjunction with an article about accessibility (attached).

      Hello,     In the 9 April draft [1], checkpoint 12.5 reads:       "12.5 In each software release, document all changes that            affect accessibility."    I think this checkpoint is could be interpreted as making  a requirement that spans more than one release of a user   agent. This would make conformance for a specific release   of a user agent impossible.    Instead, I propose the following language, which I consider  an editorial clarification:       "12.5 Document all changes from the previous version           of the user agent that affect accessibility."    Comments:     - The term "release" has been replaced by "version", which      is the term used in the section on conformance.     _ Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-UAAG10-20010409/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Al's comments below suggest that in practice, a user agent  may not be able to distinguish a client-side redirect from  a client-side refresh, and therefore we may not need two  checkpoints.    Some comments, questions, and musings:     1) Can the UA distinguish redirects and refreshes encoded with      the META element (refer to Netscape's documentation of this [1])?      I think the answer is yes. If document designated by       URL "A "contains a META element that also has URL "A", this would      most probably be a refresh, not a redirect. Also, if the       time interval is zero, then it's most probably a redirect,      not a refresh.        However, there is no guarantee that a page that is refreshed      once will continue to be refreshed in the future. Thus, you      can't assume, by looking at the META markup, that "this page      will be infinitely refreshed at the current rate."           [1] http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html     2) Should authors use client-side redirects? No.       Should authors use client-side refreshes? Maybe. There may      be other methods I don't know about.        Even if we end up with one checkpoint, I think it's worthwhile      to distinguish these semantics rather than generalize the      requirement to "allow the user to stop automatic content updates      and to update the content manually instead". I'd rather      be specific here, unless people can show other techniques      that cause similar effects that we should be addressing.     3) Should the user agent be doing anything different in the      two cases? Maybe.        * How should "back" work in the redirect case? If the        redirect were done by the server, I think that the back        behavior should be different in the case of a temporary        v. a permanent redirect. The back button should skip        a permanently redirected page, and should not skip        a temporarily redirected page. I don't know that this        distinction is made with client-side redirects. I think that        pages redirected after t=0 should be skipped by back, while        others should not.         * How should back work in the refresh case? If page A is        refreshed 8 times, should the back button take me back through        the previous instances of the page, or should it take me        to the page I visited prior to reaching A?        * We require the user agent to alert the user that new content        is available (to be retrieved manually). I think it would        be helpful to send different messages to the user in the        two cases:           Refresh case: "You should reload because fresh data                         is available."           Reload case: "You should reload because you shouldn't                       be looking at the page you are looking at."           I think setting different expectations would probably orient         the user.       4) At yesterday's call we distinguished the priorities of the       two cases based on semantics alone. We argued that in the       redirect case, it was only P2 to allow manual control since       the author's intent was that the user not view that page       anyway. And it was P1 for refresh since the user was meant       to view the content.    Conclusion:      - I think that we need to distinguish the two semantics and      I don't think it hurts to do so in two different checkpoints.        - I think that in practice it is possible to distinguish the      two META element cases that we are focusing on.     - Ian        Previous discussion on this topic:     9 May 2000 history of these two checkpoints:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0332.html     9 May 2000 teleconf discussion:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0327.html     Comments from Al based on Nir Dagan comments:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0412.html      Al wrote:  > Where am I going with this?

      Hello,     I received an action item at the 28 July teleconf [1] to propose  a checkpoint that would merge checkpoints 9.16, 9.17, and 9.18  as defined in the 16 July draft [2]. In that draft, they read:    - Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been visited  - Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the  document.   - Make available whether following a link will involve a fee.    In light of decisions at the 4 August teleconf [3], I propose the  following  checkpoints:    1) Make available information about a link that will enable the     user to decide whether to follow the link.  [Priority 3]       NOTE: Useful information includes: whether the link has already            been visited, whether it leads to a different document, and            what is the expected natural language of the link target.    2) Allow the user to know whether following a link will involve a fee.     [Priority 2].        NOTE: This information may be provided through the standard user        interface provided the interface is accessible. Thus, any prompt        asking the user to confirm payment must be accessible.    For checkpoint 2, please note that this was agreed upon at the  4 August teleconference.

      Hello,    In light of recent discussion about applicability, a request  from Charles [2] to review the use of the term in the document,  and a proposal from Eric [3] to simplify the model, I have  attempted to analyze how we use the concept of   applicability in the document. The analysis [1] has three   parts:      1) Links to background discussions and issues.    2) Summary of the six applicability provisions in       the 18 August draft [4].    3) Breakdown of how the checkpoints seem to be       covered by those provisions.          a) Some of the checkpoints seem unaffected and          thus would always apply.         b) Two of the provisions seem unnecessary and          can be removed: unsupported technologies,          unsupported communication.         c) The other four provisions can be stated          more succinctly and, according to this          analysis, should be left in the document.:          content type, content role, content properties,          and rendering support.    My hope in doing this analysis was that I would  conclude that applicability was not necessary and  could be removed from the document. This was Eric's  conclusion [3], though his conclusion is based on  the premise that "a checkpoint is applicable to a   user agent if the checkpoint requires capabilities that  the developer of the user agent intends for users   without any disability." I haven't been able to  agree with that starting point since there are some  requirements that are principally about features for  users with disabilities (e.g., captions) and others  that are required whether or not the developer intended  them for users without disabilities (e.g., DOM support).    Thus, while I believe that we can get rid of two  of the applicability provisions, so far I have not  been convinced that we can get rid of the remaining   four. I'm still hoping we can!     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/08/uaag10-applic  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0031.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0225.html  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

How about something like "Ensure that the user agent  >         supports all input device APIs support on the platforms it is  >         designed to work on."    There are a number of requirements to be handled:     - make ALL functionalities available   - make them available through ALL SUPPORTED APIs   - make them available through STANDARD APIs on the system.    The first two are covered by 1.1. The third is covered by 1.2.  It was a conscious decision to split the three pieces up since  three requirements in one sentence was hard to manage.     Your proposed checkpoint doesn't capture the first requirement above.    > > > Checkpoint 2.7 - What if the object isn't video or audio?

This case is covered by the "applicability" provision. From  the definition of "applicability", a checkpoint doesn't apply if:          "The checkpoint includes requirements about a content          type (script, image, video, sound, applets, etc.)          that the user agent does not recognize at all."    A lot of people have missed the applicability provision in the  glossary and I'm really starting to think it should be moved back  to the section on conformance.    > > > Guideline #4  > > >  > > > A.

      Hello,    The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group  is nearing "last call" for its Guidelines [2].  A Working Group issues a last call for a document that it  considers done (or close to done). Last call involves  review by other working groups (and possibly requests  for implementation experience, for example). After last call,  a document may become a Proposed Recommendation, then a   Recommendation (I'm skipping the details of the W3C Process,  but people may consult [4] for more information).    In order for the User Agent Guidelines to enter last call,   we consider it important that the Techniques Document [1] be  complete and solid. Note that the  Techniques Document is not on the track to Recommendation  (like its cousin the Techniques Document for WCAG 1.0,  it is expected to end up being a W3C Note). However,   a strong Techniques Document will indicate the stability   of the Guidelines document in at least two ways:    1) It will indicate that we have considered the implications     of each checkpoint on implementations. Gaps in the techniques     document will suggest that some checkpoints may not     be sufficiently cooked.      2) It will show that we have found a balance between the     "checkpoint" level and the "technique" level. At times,     we debate whether a requirement should be represented by      a checkpoint or a technique. If the techniques document     has been developed, this should indicate that we are     comfortable with the distribution of requirements.    The Working Group encourages the Interest Group to review the   Techniques Document (latest version at [1]) and either   send comments on existing content or offer to contribute  ideas or content to as yet undeveloped sections. We encourage  you to talk to developers about techniques and encourage them  to send technical information that will allow us to complete  this document.    In particular, the Working Group is interested in comments  about the following topics:      - Suggestions for implementing checkpoints of the lastest      UA Guidelines [2].      - Suggestions for user agent approaches to navigation      - Suggestions for user agent approaches to searching      - Information on how dependent user agents and browsers      can communicate most efficiently.      - Suggestions for promoting user orientation (e.g.,       automatically generated structural views, site maps,       handling of metadata, etc.)      - Suggestions on giving the user control of document      presentation (with or without style sheets).      - Suggestions about accessible multimedia players.    Please send comments before 11 October, the start date of the   Working Group's next face-to-face meeting (meeting page [3]).

[Priority 1]  > </NEW1>    I have a counter-proposal. First, some observations and resolutions:     1) Merge 4.16 and 4.17 since now more closely related.     2) From Issue 353 resolution:      http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-353        a) The default highlighting mechanisms required by the document      (for selection, focus, etc.) must not rely on color alone.           b) The default highlighting mechanisms .... must differ from each      other and not by color alone.     3) From minutes of 7 Dec teleconf:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0383.html          a) Remove minimal font requirement.      b) However, if fonts used, must be able         to configure font characteristics.    Putting it all together:    <NEW_IAN>     4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus and     current selection are highlighted      (e.g., through foreground and background color,      voice pitch, etc.). The default highlight styles must not     rely on color alone. The default focus and     selection styles must also differ from each other, and not     through color alone. If text decorations (e.g., underlining,     bold, etc.) or font styles are used as a highlight     mechanism, the user must be able to configure them      according to the range of text decoration or fonts      available on the system.    AND:       Delete checkpoint 4.16, since incorporated.  </NEW_IAN>    I don't support an additional requirement that the user  agent guarantee that the selection and focus always  be distinguishable for the following reason:      1) I don't think that we should have a requirement that       the highlight mechanism used for selection and focus       necessarily be different (e.g., a box around focus and       color for selection, forbidding the use of two different       colors.    2) Given that, then the user could specify that both       are highlighted with colors, and the UA would have to       carry out a calculation each time one or the other changed       to determine whether there was overlap and provide a specialized       presentation for the case of overlap.      3) By default, we require that the two highlights differ, and not       differ by color alone. That means that if the user chooses       to configure them to use the same mechanism, then it's the user's       problem, not the UA's.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't think the straightforward substitution works because it  necessarily excludes other pieces of the puzzle. Access to equivalents  means equivalents however they are specified: by attribute values (alt),  by reference (longdesc), in content (OBJECT), in HTTP headers, etc.  Choosing one piece without the others is likely to lead to some  incomplete statements.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Per my action item from the 16 May teleconference [1], please  consider this proposal for changes to some of the checkpoints in  Guideline 6. This proposal intends to address issues 471 [2], 472  [3], and 480 [4].    Tim, Rich, Scott: Please indicate your support for this proposal.    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0161  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#471  [3] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#472  [4] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#480    Reference document: 11 April 2001 draft:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/    ------------  Introduction  ------------    The proposal attempts to provide answers to the following  questions in a clear and consistent manner:     a) What is a "standard" API?   b) Which is more important: implementing some API, or      implementing a standard API?   c) What happens when there is no standard API?   d) What happens when the API doesn't meet the developer's needs?   e) What happens when the developer has an API that is "better"      than the standard API? Should conformance be possible when      the user agent implements a better API?    I list all of these questions because they have all been asked at  one time or another. They also may make good FAQ questions.    At the 16 May teleconference, the Working Group renewed their  commitment to requiring standard APIs as a way of ensuring  interoperability. However, the WG moved in the direction of  acknowledging the following hierarchy of API preferences:     1) Prefer an API that has been standardized (e.g., by W3C).      The WG distinguished a standard API that is "broken" from       one that is non-standard. The WG has said that it's fine to      work around the former, but that if there is an API and      it's not broken, it's preferred over a non-standard API.      2) Otherwise, prefer an API that enables interoperability by      having at least the following characteristics:         a) It is publicly documented       b) More than one assistive technology may use it          for interaction with a conforming user agent.      3) Otherwise, there is a risk that the API will not       meet our expectations of ensuring that assistive technology      developers will have available and robuts APIs, or that      the cost of developing to N different APIs will be prohibitive.      (For more arguments, refer to email from Rich [5] and Tim [6]).        Note: The WG recognizes that user agents and assistive      technologies may already be deployed having implemented APIs      that do not satisfy the interoperability requirements of this      document. Specific user agent/AT combinations may provide      accessible solutions for some users today (and that's good),      but if the user agent doesn't satisfy the requirements of      Guideline 6, it does not meet the WG's expectations about      interoperability and the desirability of having a choice of      assistive technologies.    [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0132  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0156    ------------------------  1) Definition of "standard API"  ------------------------    A "standard API" is a publicly documented API that is the result  of a standards process (e.g., the W3C Recommendation track). For  the purposes of this document "de facto standards" and  proprietary operating environment APIs do not qualify as standard  APIs.    <DELETE from definition of API>  As part of encouraging interoperability, this document recommends  using standard APIs where possible, although this document does  not define in all cases how those APIs are standardized (i.e.,  whether they are defined by specifications such as W3C  Recommendations, defined by an operating environment vendor, de  facto standards, etc.).  </DELETE from definition of API>    Comment: The above definition may sound like a dramatic change,  but as the checkpoint below reveal, it is only one of definition.    ----------------------------  2) Changes to G6 checkpoints  ----------------------------    Summary: Guideline 6 checkpoints can be organized as follows  (and this might be useful in the Guideline prose):     a) What information must be made available through an API.   b) Which APIs must be used to provide this information.   c) Constraints on providing this information.    More specifically:     a) What information must be made available through an API:            - HTML and XML content (6.1, 6.2)      - Non-HTML/XML markup content (6.3)      - CSS content when CSS implemented (6.9)      - User interface controls (6.4)      - Changes to content and user interface controls (6.5)        Note: Write access is always limited to what the user can do            through the UI anyway.     b) Which APIs must be used to provide this information:        b1) For HTML, XML, and CSS, use the DOM (6.1, 6.2, and 6.9)      b2) Otherwise, use          - Standard APIs or APIs designed to benefit accessibility (6.6)        - Standard input and output APIs (6.6), and specifically          the standard keyboard APIs (6.7)         c) Constraints on providing information through an API:        - Support character encodings (6.8)      - Exchange information in a timely manner (6.10)    Please consider the following reorganization based on this model  and our discussions. There are no changes proposed for  checkpoints 6.1, 6.2, 6.8, 6.9, and 6.10.    <NEW 6.3>    For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide    programmatic read access to content.  Provide programmatic    write access for those parts of content that the user can    modify through the user interface. Content only.  </NEW 6.3>    <NEW 6.4>   Provide programmatic read access to user agent user interface   controls.  Provide programmatic write access to those controls   of the user agent user interface that the user can modify   through the user interface.  For security reasons, user agents   are not required to allow instructions in content to modify user   agent user interface controls. User agent only.      Note: This checkpoint is designed to enable users to interact    with the user agent user interface controls through assistive    technologies.  </NEW 6.4>    <NEW 6.5>   Provide programmatic alert of changes to content, user interface   controls, selection, content focus, and user interface focus.   Both content and user agent.  </NEW 6.5>    <DELETE 6.6>   Refer to new 6.X below.  </DELETE 6.6>    <NEW 6.X>   To satisfy the requirements of each checkpoint 6.3, 6.4, and   6.5, implement at least one API that is either (a) a standard   API or (b) one designed to enable interoperability with   assistive technologies. If neither type of API is available, or   if available APIs do not enable the user agent to satisfy the   requirements of the checkpoint, implement at least one publicly   documented API to satisfy the requirements of the checkpoint   <em>and</em> follow operating environment conventions for   the use of input and output APIs.        Note: User agents should follow operating environment      conventions for the use of input and output APIs in all       cases.  </NEW 6.X>    Comment: This proposal differs slightly from our discussion at  the teleconference.     - The old checkpoint 6.6 has been folded into this one. It   considers standard APIs on par with ones designed to promote   interoperability with assistive technologies.  Thus, to satisfy   checkpoint 6.5, a user agent could provide alert of changes   through either the DOM Events API or MSAA.     - The checkpoint does not talk about how APIs satisfy "the   requirements of the document" because the API requirements we   are talking about are all in checkpoints 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5. The   other requirements outside of Guideline 6 are meant to be   satisfied through the UI, through config files, on the Web   (documentation), etc. but NOT through APIs. This, in my opinion,   tightens up the document significantly.     - The second part of the checkpoint does not talk about   the publicly documented APIs having to enable interoperability    since that's now covered by the first part of the checkpoint.    <NEW 6.7>   Follow operating environment conventions when implementing   APIs for the keyboard.         Note: Operating environment conventions may require more than      one API for the keyboard. For instance, for Japanese and      Chinese, input may be processed in two stages, with an API      for each.    </NEW 6.7>    ----------------------------  3) Changes to conformance  ----------------------------    To section 3.6 "Well-formed conformance claims", add two  requirements:     - The claim must indicate which APIs are used to satisfy the   checkpoints of Guideline 6.     - The claim must indicate which formats are used to satisfy the   checkpoints (both for content labels and Guideline 8). Note:   This second requirement was not discussed at the teleconference,   but I recall it here since it is part of another proposal.      ----------------------------  4) Techniques  ----------------------------    I think that in the Techniques Document we *must* be able to  provide an example of an API that would satisfy checkpoints 6.3,  6.4, and 6.5. For example:     6.3: ?? Help!   6.4: On Windows, MSAA. For Java, Java Access API.   6.5: On Windows, MSAA. Or the DOM Events model.   6.X: Any DOM API, MSAA, Java Access API, others?    Please make additional suggestions!    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

From the 9 August draft [1]:    <BLOCKQUOTE>    In order to conform as a graphical desktop browser,     the user agent must satisfy all the checkpoints (for a    chosen conformance level) that apply to graphical desktop     browsers and do so natively.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990809/#conformance    That's the only way to conform as a desktop graphical browser   (according to the spec). The same applies to dependent UAs.    In January we considered this (refer to Option 3 of [1]):    <BLOCKQUOTE>         b.ii) UAs must also satisfy the applicable Priority 1                checkpoints natively or be able to demonstrate               that, in conjunction with readily available                products, the checkpoints are satisfied.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0017.html    The Working Group did not elect to pursue this option.       - Ian

Action IJ: Add definitions to the document.        2.PR#271: Checkpoint 4.7: Change to P2 since arbitrary repositioning                 not a requirement.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#271         /* Ian summarizes discussion of last week */         AG: The requirement is that you be able to position captions           w.r.t. the video. (Needs to be clear in checkpoint.)         TL: I'd like to run this by the IE Team.         IJ: Note that the primary question is what's the accessibility           requirement.             TL: I will send email to the list.         AG: You could ask Cindy King (at Galudet); she's done work           in this area.         Action AG: Write to her and copy me.        3.PR#233: Checkpoint 7.6: What does "structure" mean here?        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#233          Refer to JG's email:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0086.html          Refer to Al's email:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0188.html          AG: I thought next week's teleconf on navigation was for  fact-finding?          JG: More about markup.          AG: How can you tell the implementor what is structural?            You want to discuss with WCAG WG what you know from            the markup.          IJ: Some things are encoded in HTML spec.            AG: But some are encoded in layout, not in header tree.             Proposal:          1) We leave the word "structure" in the checkpoint text           (Allow the user to navigate according to structure.)        AG: The "gotcha" I see is when the markup is not helpful          to you (e.g., current practice). Skip subtree capability          is assumed by WCAG (e.g., skipping navbars). That's why          teleconf next week would be useful: talk to WCAG about          what model in UAs may be expected by authors.          2) Explain that structure is based on the document object           model (in the generic sense) but may have more           semantic information when known from the markup language           definition, through schemas, etc.        3) Therefore, the minimal requirement (since the goals are           orientation and rapid navigation) is to allow navigation           according to the semantic model known for the markup language,           paying particular attention to block and grouping mechanisms,           and having a subtree skip and/or hide functionality.        AG: I'm not happy with this proposal. You should state more of          what the user needs:                1) Decompose the page into principle parts               2) Be able to get to the beginning of any part (quickly).        MN: That's what the "e.g." in the current 7.6 says to me.          IJ: Two pieces:           a) Where does the structure come from?            - Semantic model (structure, schemas, specifications)            - Repair of poorly constructed page is extra-credit.         b) What set of functionalities of navigation?       AG: I don't think that we should be espousing theories about         what the UA should provide if why don't apply to actual         content in the world. We need evidence that something         is effective, not only readily achievable. The specs on          whole are not effective in this regard (point "a" from Ian).         I think you can say some minimum things from known structures         (e.g., headers).         AG: I think it's easier to come up with performance requirements         (e.g., lists no lnoger than five) rather than rules for         extracting the navigation tree from markup.       AG: I agree with statements like "If there are headings, you         should include them."       IJ: Are you saying we can't rely on the markup?       AG: No. If you just use HTML, you don't get a usable product.        You have people using tables and frames to implement the        same functional object. People have N ways of building a         header bar. The specs don't tell you how to do this.           AG: You have evidence of user agents doing good things in         structured navigation, but you have not criteria for         drawing the line.       JG: Are you suggesting that we leave open the minimal          requirement?       AG: Almost: include what is necessary, but indicate that         it's not sufficient. More research would be necessary         to know what's a minimum requirement for a markup language.       KG: I think we can make the argument about a lot of checkpoints.       DA: Then we'll continue to get the complaint that people don't         know when they conform.       JG: Does the configuration checkpoint help us?       AG: It helps me. I think you have to consider 7.6, 7.7,         and 8.6 (orientation) together.       AG: The user agent's view has to have structure, so that         the user can form a navigation model. Yes, the          markup specs and author's intent help infer structure.       IJ: In my mind, the author provides a "view" and the user         agent allows the user to handle this view flexibly.       AG: The requirement for structured navigation to provide         a structure that the user can move through. How this relates         to what's provided in the format is part of the implementation.         It's not the basic requirement. The user needs to break the         problem down into parts. And to be able to navigate to them.         The mission statement is missing.       IJ: I hear Al saying that "chunk" navigation is the requirement.         We subsumed this under "structured navigation" since we         knew structure generically (doc tree). This checkpoint          subsumed a number of other checkpoints (e.g., table cell         navigation), which are in techniques.       /* Charles drops out */       AG:      a) Chunk navigation is not the only piece we need to address.        But it's a good example of where our problems come from.     b) In PF, we're working on XML (DTD) guidelines. So that users        can break down content into component parts.       AG: We want this guideline to drive the PF dialogues. I need         this to state the functional requirement for the user.       IJ: "Navigate efficiently to significant components of content."       RS: What about "contextual navigation"?       AG: "Contextual navigation" is a superclass of "structured          navigation".           GR: Need to provide the ability to expand and contract         subtrees.       GR: Issues of navigation and others are coming to light in         the effort to generalize the content guidelines.       Action AG: Write comments based on current techniques as     fodder for the WCAG/UA joint teleconf on 4 May.       Action JG: Write a proposal / clarification about 7.6 to the                 list (to clarify "navigate" and "structure").       /* Discussion of timing issues: WWW9, then AC meeting,        then Ian vacation, then Jon unavailable in June,         then summer slowdown, ... */       4.PR#207: Interpretation checkpoint 2.1        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#207        Refer to JG summary:      AG: I concur with summary sent by JG.      DA: Problem if I need to access the summary and all I have         is a source view, that doesn't cut it. You have to have         access to equivalents in the same context.      IJ: Refer to my proposal that says this:           http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0223.html      DA: But it's not just alternative equivalents that need to          be available in the same view. Attributes, too.     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      User Agent Guidelines Teleconference  1 September 1999    Present:    Jon Gunderson (Chair)  Ian Jacobs (Scribe)  Gregory Rosmaita  Harvey Bingham  Jim Thatcher  Kitch Barnicle  Mark Novak  Judy Brewer  Marja Koivunen  David Poehlman  Rich Schwertdfeger  Charles McCathieNevile  Jim Allan    Agenda [1]:    1) Review of action items  2) Last call scheduling  3) Conformance      [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0278.html      Agenda 1) Review of action items.       1.JG: Draft outline for section 5.3.3 of techniques document.

ACTION JG: Include this message in next call for participation.    Agenda 2)  REMINDER: Register for October F2F Meeting     JG: Remember to ask for the W3C rate at the hotel.      The registration page is up and running.    Agenda 3) LAST CALL: Timing and document preparation     JG: We are nearing, but have not entered last call. The original      intent of the face-to-face was to address comments that      came in during last call. But given state of techniques      document and number of open issues, not ready to go to       last call yet. Therefore, I'd like to discuss the impact      on the face-to-face meeting.    DP: Have all the unfilled techniques been assigned?    IJ: No. We sent a call for attention to the UAGL list.    JB: Do you want to send to the IG?    Action IJ: Send a detailed call for review to the IG.    JG: What do people think about going to last call?    MN: I have mixed emotions. Recent issues raise some       concerns. Also question whether we should have a face-to-face.    JG: I feel strongly that we should go to last call shortly      after the face-to-face.    RS: I feel we need to resolve the conformance issue ("targeted agent")      before going to last call. Otherwise, I think the guidelines      are pretty good.    DP: I think we should tackle outstanding issues first. I'm not      certain we could be ready for last call by the end of next week.    GR: I agree. In my evaluation, I emphasized checkpoints that      might be better as techniques (e.g., following a link involves      a fee).    IJ: (Review of process)    JB:    a) The sooner you finish the document, the sooner developers will      use it.   b) If you wait, you are likely to have a better document. But      don't wait too long since document may become irrelevant.      My preference, all other things equal, is to go to last call   as soon as possible. But if you have open issues, don't go   to last call yet. Another consideration is staff resources.   AUGL and UAGL are running neck and neck. If they go to Recommendation   in parallel, will make it tough on W3C Team resources. We don't   know how the timing of this document is affecting developer   browser release cycles.     JB: One possibility is to go to last call in three weeks, then       have a 3-week last call. That may not be enough time to       compile comments in time for last call. Strategically,       you don't want to send doc out twice for last call. However,       you can take extra time before going to Proposed Recommendation.      HB: A number of the major browser/assistive tech groups have        had no input to this process.      CMN: In AUGL, we've had a similar experience. But we've approached        developers lately who've said "We haven't commented but        we're trying to implement them!"      JB: What's the strategic impact of waiting?      IJ: Let's get other developers on board during this interval        before the face-to-face.      GR: Use evaluations as feedback to developers.      JB: But, until you say to someone "Last chance for comments",        people may not react or be motivated.      GR: In some cases, we may still light a fire under developers.      JB: We tried this in AU, but had no impact. We tried last year        internally but was a returnless effort.      JG: I don't think we'll get developers to jump to attention until        we go to last call.       JG: I propose that we try to go to last call 16-17 October. We         will revisit the question at the next teleconference. Judy,         Jon, Ian will discuss resource issues offline.       JB: I've argued for moving to last call soon. If the WG         feels that's ill-advised, please disregard my comments         as needed.    Agenda 3)  Issues #77 and #79: Conformance for some assistive techs.       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#77        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#79     JG: RS has proposed a third conformance class.    JG: IBM HPR, Avanti, PWWebSpeak don't fit easily into      dependent UA group. I'd like the dependent UA class to      represent advanced features. We don't care whether these      features are implemented in a browser or assistive tech.    JG: Biggest concerns with dependent UAs relate to compatibility      guideline (6 in 27 Aug draft).    JT:   a) What was the intent of the dependent UA category?     Seems to be "everything but graphical desktop browser".        JB: What about text browsers?   IJ: You conform by meeting a set of checkpoints. That's all it       means.  JT: I don't want Productivity Works to spend time putting      MSAA into its specialized interface. We would have to      in order to conform as dependent UA. They shouldn't      have to based on their "targetedness".    JG: Checkpoint about communication between dependent UAs       to promote communication between them. If that's the      major issue, let's review it. Are there other checkpoints      that don't make sense?    JT: There are others - because HPR is targetted to people     who use speech and the keyboard, we shouldn't have to     comply with 1.1.     CMN: The problem with the targetted approach is that     users working together may have different functional     needs. Graphical desktop browser is a targetted UA.    IJ: Have you seen "applies to"?    JT: No. That helps, but look at "low vision" requirements.      We have to say "not applicable". Our graphical interface      is not relevant to the evaluation.    JG: Issue: Which output of the tool do you evaluate? Primary      or secondary?     JT: The visual user interface of HPR is irrelvant for the      discussion we're having.     RS: The only reason for the visual interface is to help      a sighted user work with someone who cannot see.      JT: Also for debugging.      DP: If a blind person is teaching a sighted person, the      sighted person would still need an interface.     JT: HPR can turn on synchronziation for this purpose: cause      Netscape to bring up the same page.     DP: My concern here: can I voice command input into HRP.      That's a legitimate concern.     JT: Yes, through the keyboard API. You can use voice      recognition, therefore, to activate keys.     KB: Will the font/color adjustments apply to Lynx?     DP: Lynx doesn't care about fonts. So no, doesn't apply.     JT: We have comparable       requirements for voice (e.g., changing voice       for links).     CMN: Lynx hands off issues of font size to the OS.       But I agree that you can't style or control the       presentation of a link w.r.t. an ordinary piece of       text.     JT: For Lynx, there are no fonts.     IJ: There are colors, though.     JG: I'd like to move back to the question of        PWWebSpeak and HPR in terms of conformance.       Need to evaluate definition of "applies to".     CMN: If you take a given UA, you can say "This       UA requires a minimal set of input/output." For HPR,       the minimal output set is speech. MInimal input set       is the keyboard. That is has added input/output       is not relevant for conformance.      DP: There are one or two UAs that are uncommon in their       special capabilities for specific audiences. I think       we need only expand the definition of "applies" to       be able to exclude device issues.       JT: I agree with this approach.     CMN: Do HPR need to apply to UAGL at all? Maybe they        don't since they are trying to meet specific needs.        We've been addressing "general accessibility" up to        now. A UA that didn't allow that therefore wouldn't        conform. I don't think this is a bad thing. In short,        specialized tools may not need to conform to the        same set of guidelines as a generalized tool.     JT: Then bite the bullet and state that.    CMN: One possible outcome would be to drop the dependent       user agent conformance clause. Dependent user agents       don't conform unless they attempt to function        more generally. I think, however, that it's still       critical to explain how assistive techs will work with       general tools that conform.    RS: And for dependent user agents, we would need guidelines      for features relevant to a particular disability. What      I have a problem with is "do so natively" definition.      Do we need to redefine this for targetted UAs?    CMN: I think we should specify what we expect dependent      user agents to do in order to interoperate with a      conforming UA. But we should drop other requirements      for targetted UAs.     IJ: We've had this discussion already at the beginning       of 1999. It proved too difficult to break out       the different functions, devices, content types       into different documents or guidelines. We decided       to keep it all in one document.     GR: I propose creating W3C Notes for particular slices.       I second CMN's motion to drop the subclassing.     JG: Recall that the split was made, in part to allow       consumers to ask intelligent questions about       assistive technologies. I gather from previous        discussions that assistive tech developers want       to be able to conform to the UAGL. So benefits to       consumers as well as assitive tech developers.      RS: The impact matrix is very helpful for figuring        out what's important for a targeted agent.         E.g., I'm building a speech output device on        multiple platforms. I would want this type of        of checklist. I would want to consider less        the particular platform. If, on the other        hand, I were building a speech synthesizer to        run in the background would do something else.         IJ: We've already had a proposal (in January)         to not have conformance at all, but just         suggest profiles and have developers         fill out the checklist.        DP: Screen readers are, can, and should be providing  access through interfaces. My expectations  are rising. I think there is a need for the         dependent UA checkpoints that are in there that         promote interoperability and cooperation.           KB: One fear about the impact matrix is that        singling out a particular population will cause        people to ignore important features for other users.        In many cases, benefits are for multiple groups,        even though there may be a particular population that       would benefit most. In many cases, all users, and       use at the same time by several people, needs to be considered.       MK: The matrix is kind of a "next phase" after conformance.       GR: I don't think that targetted information should be        included in a document that addresses generality.      CMN: The impact matrix (assuming it's correct), allows you        to say "I'm not interested in a universally accessible        product" and you can be relatively sure to satisfy        requirements. I don't think we should write a Note, however.        It's a byproduct of the group.       IJ: I think our charter says that we must consider targetted        user agents. Can't just dismiss them.         RS: My main issue is "applies to". Perhaps we need wording         that some functionalities are not fundamental to          accessibility, but are only meant for people "along for the         ride."        IJ: I have problems with "along for the ride". A lot of people         would say the same thing about documentation. But it's         certainly vital to using software for many.         RS: I don't want to do major surgery on the guidelines. The          area that needs focus is "native support." Don't change          the whole document.           HB: Would it be worth having another reply (other than          yes, no,  not applicable) for checkpoints.      Action CMN: Write a proposal for moving forward on this issue to          the list.      Action IJ: In document, highlight existence of "native"      and "applies to".        

      9 November 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:     Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs, Mickey Quenzer,      Harvey Bingham, Kitch Barnicle, Gregory Rosmaita,     Tim Lacy, Jim Allan, David Poehlman    Regrets:      Debby Fletter (from AOL), Eric Hansen    Absent:      Rich Schwerdtfeger, Charles McCathieNevile    Upcoming meetings:      16 November (face-to-face)       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/ua-meeting    23 November: No meeting (Thanksgiving)    30 November: Teleconference    Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0226.html  Minutes of previous meeting 2 November     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0210.html    Review Action Items (see details below)    Announcements        1.ER/PF FTF meeting in Washington, D.C. on 4-5 December        JG: I plan to attend.

Agenda       IJ: If we have time beyond handling issues, what would we do?       1) Discuss our goals for all W3C WG in February 2001.        JG: From WAI CG, I didn't get strong vibes that other WAI WGs           want to meet with us; they want to meet with other WGs.     2) Review the trouble spots of the implementation report     3) Review the trouble spots of the Techniques document        JG: I'll try to prepare for this.     4) What we will do if we have to go to CR?        MQ: My expectation was to get implementation experience            from reviewers.        GR: Some reviewers aren't forthcoming about their support            for features, e.g., the DOM.     5) Brainstorming on requirements for next draft.     6) How to get W3C Members involved, integration of accessibility        features into specs or separate?     7) MQ: I'd like to talk about promotion of the document.        JG: We need to coordinate with EO.     8) Coordination with other WGs in general.        GR: And ER in particular.       /* Discussion about current implementations v. forward-looking       requirements */      Resolved:      - In Note after 4.14 explain that the CSS2 reference is        there to provide background information about what the        terms mean.

IJ: I haven't heard much disagreement in the way of requirements.      Mostly in the way of definitions.    /* IJ describes how alternative is more about author-side     and equivalent is about user-side */    GR: If we don't have convergence in use of terms between WCAG 1.0  and UAAG 1.0, need to report an erratum (and work on convergence  for WCAG 2.0).    GR: There are (or were) a number of sites that translated text  into braille (with GIFs of individual braille characters). But  I also want to know "this has dots 1, 2, 4, and 6". Another layer  of abstraction is "this is the precise mapping of the dot". Another  human-understandable is the roman alphabet equivalent.     GR: I can't tell whether the issue is editorial (definitional)  yet until I see another version.    JG: I think that it's really in the WCAG court to say what  an equivalent is (and how it's identified). And we need to  focus on making those available.    GR: I think that different classes of equivalents becomes a UA issue  (e.g., to provide access to more or less verbose equivalents).    IJ: We are awaiting information from Eric on this topic.    6.Issue #322: The definition of the word element    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0131.html    Open Action Items     1.GR: Contacts for Dolphin for reviewing WCAG   Continued     2.GR: Review checkpoints in Guideline 10 for implementation information   Continued     4.KB: Submit technique on providing information on current item and          number of items in search    Continued     5.JA: Review checkpoints in Guideline 4 for implementation information   Continued     6.HB: Review guideline 3 for implementation information   Continued     7.CMN: Send a proposed definition of equivalent to the group   Not done    Completed Action Items        1.IJ: Reserve hotel rooms for FTF meeting         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0220.html        2.JG: Add issues from adobe review to the issues list        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html        3.JG: Send a last call reminder to chairs, WAI groups and invited  reviewers         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000OctDec/0449.html        3.MQ: Review speech checkpoints for implementation information      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0225.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I though we agreed that in-process communication should be   highlighted as a technique. I propose the following edit:    <PROPOSED>  This checkpoint is designed to reduce delays that an assistive  technology user might experience due to communication overhead.  Timely exchange is import for preventing loss of information,  a risk when changes in content occur faster than the  exchange with the assistive technology. One effective technique   for providing timely access is to allow assistive technologies to run   in the same process space as the user agent, thus eliminating  inter-application communication delays.  </PROPOSED>     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I have proposed techniques     DP: If three spaces are not considered an empty string,     then the screen reader will not know that there is     anything there.        - Accept as we are matching WCAG 1.0 requirements:      null alt is considered valid.    - Our focus requirements of G9 mean that people      can get to the links.    - Information is available through the DOM and       can find out that images are present.    - Empty string has no characters (including spaces).    - Put in techniques document to allow configuration      in case of spaces alone.    5) Accept.  6) Accept.  7) Accept.  8) Accept.  9) Accept.  10) "Indicate the viewport's position relative to       rendered content."  11) Accept.  12) Accept. But :    - Don't emphasize single-user environment.    - Change available profiles to available default      profiles or those created by the user.  13) Accept.  14) Accept.  15) Accept. Someone might receive claim by email, or      might be on CD-ROM. People won't make a conformance      claim and hide it from people.      - Add (e.g., on the Web, on CD-ROM, etc.).  16) Accept.  17) Accept.      - Not just 8.2, but also Guideline 6.    Resolved:     - Added to well-formed claim requirements that claim     must include information that enables the user to     identify the user agent (e.g., version for      a particular natural language).    /* Eric leaves */    #492: History mechanism and relation to plug-ins     JG: You can only keep track of your own focus.   When you get back focus, restore the previous state. No  communication is necessary with the plug-in.    TL: The only difference between a new viewer and an embedded one, is  that we call the former and host the latter. When the SVG viewer is  called, IE has lost the focus. If you close the external viewer or  switch back to IE, IE picks up where it left off.    Resolved:     - No change to the document; each viewport maintains its own     history information.    #493: 3.2/3.4: Limit animations to those "in a bounding box"     Resolved:     - No exemption for animations outside the box.   - For checkpoints 3.1, 3.2, 3.7, eliminate placeholder     requirement and point to checkpoint 2.3 since unrendered     content becomes conditional content.   - For checkpoint 3.8, put this under Guideline 2 and have     it refer to checkpoint 2.3 in the placeholder case.    /* Tim leaves */    #494: Definition: "Explicit user request" slightly broken     See above resolution of 490 to modify definition of explicit user  request.    #500: Captions positioning.    JA: I asked Geoff Freed to review the proposal:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0195    #502: What constitutes blinking?     GR: Slow blinking may cause problems for people with      cognitive disabilities.  JA: Also, 3 seconds on, 3 seconds off may cause people to miss      content.  MQ: Blinking at any rate can disturb assistive technologies.    Resolved:     - Do not restrict requirement on blinking text to the range of     2 Hz to 55 Hz (as is done in section 508).   - Define blinking per CSS2. "Blinking text alternates between     a visible and invisible state."    #503: 9.3: Clarification requested: does this mean that onfocus events  are not triggered?    IJ: "onblur" isn't part of 9.4, since you've already left the      element. Or are we to break onblur semantics?    JG: The purpose of this is that some scripting is problematic  from an accessibility standpoint.      IJ: We need to clarify what types of handlers 9.4 and 9.5  are about.    JA: Also a problem with respect to 9.3; it might break  the history.    IJ: It's not clear to me what HTML attributes, for example,  are covered by 9.4 and 9.5, since those checkpoints  takl about "input device" event handlers. Are these just  about keyboard/mouse? What about onfocus itself, or onblur?

      Hello,    Per my action item of the 7 September 2000  teleconference [1], here is a proposal for  aligning the audio, video, and animation  requirements of Guidelines 3 and 4 with the  discussions during the last teleconference. This   email is in five parts: background, summary   of issues, proposals for guideline 3, proposals  for guideline 4, and a proposed new checkpoint about  accessible generated content. URIs are at   the end of the email. The checkpoint numbers   given here are those of the 1 September draft [2].    1) BACKGROUND    The previous time we had this discussion about  Guidelines 3 and 4 was 27 July [3]. At that time,   the Working Group adopted a proposal [4]   that I will summarize here:      1) Guideline three is about configuration and       global settings.       2) Guideline four is about element-level control.     The adopted proposal argued that element-level control  after a global "off" setting was unnecessary since  the user had the necessary control per Guideline 4.   However, at the previous teleconference, the  Working group asserted otherwise.    2) SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION    Our discussions have brought to light several  ideas that were not addressed in the previous  proposal:      2a) When there is a configuration not to render       some author-supplied content, the user must be       informed that this content is available but        not rendered.      2b) Typically, the way that user agents indicate       the absence of author-supplied content is with        placeholders.      2c) These placeholders must be accessible.       2d) Element-level control is indeed required after a       global configuration not to render some content       type. One reason for this (forwarded by Denis       Anson) is that N pieces of content rendered       together may not be accessible, but each one       may be accessible when retrieved individually.      2e) Automatic user agent behavior (in this case       rendering content) may not be accessible and there       needs to be a requirement to allow the user to       control the behavior manually. We already have       such requirements for form submission, page       refreshes, focus changes, etc. It is natural to       extend this reasoning to rendering: some content       rendered automatically may be inaccessible, and       and the Working Group has asked for a requirement       that the user be able to access it on demand only.    3) PROPOSALS FOR GUIDELINE THREE    Note: Checkpoints 4.5 and 4.6 combine audio,  video, and animations. For consistency, I will  combine some checkpoints of Guideline 3 similarly.  There are no proposed changes to checkpoints 3.4,  3.7, and 3.8.      3a) Add a technique for all configuration checkpoints       not to render some content that the user       agent may choose not to download this       content at all. This technique already       appears in some of the current checkpoints.     3b) Background images (checkpoint 3.1):      New:         Allow the user to configure the user agent       not to render background images. Allow        configuration to notify the user when a        background image is present but not rendered.            Note: When background images          are not rendered, user agents should          render a solid background color.           This checkpoint only requires control of           background for "two-layered renderings", i.e., one          rendered background (other than a solid          color) with all other content rendered "above it".       Comments:         - Delete the following note since already in         the guideline prose:            "Background images may make it difficult or           impossible to read superimposed text."     3c) Guideline 3 checkpoints about configuration       of audio, video, and animated images (old       checkpoints 3.2, 3.3, and 3.5)      New:         Allow the user to configure the user agent        not to render audio, video, or animated        images except on explicit request from the        user. Allow a second configuration so       that when this content is not rendered,        the user agent renders a substitute placeholder        in context. When placeholders are rendered,        allow the user to activate each placeholder        individually and replace it with the        original author-supplied content.          Note: This checkpoint applies to content          rendered without any user interaction          (including content rendered on load or           as the result of a script) as well as content           rendered as the result of user interaction          that is not an explicit request           (e.g., when the user activates a link).          Activation of a placeholder is considered          an explicit user request to render the          original content. Refer also to checkpoints          in Guideline 4 about control of audio,          video, and animation.      Comments:        - Move the following note to the guideline prose:        "Audio may interfere with other sources of         sound such as the output of a speech          synthesizer."       3d) Guideline 3 checkpoint about configuration       of images (checkpoint 3.9).      New: Same as previous checkpoint (3c) except that     it's only about images and it's a priority 2    checkpoint.     3e) Guideline 3 checkpoint about configuration       for scripts and applets (checkpoint 3.6).      New: Allow the user to configure the user agent not to          execute scripts or applets. Allow          configuration to notify the user when scripts          or applets are present but not executed.          Note: This is particularly important for          scripts that cause the screen to flicker,           since people with photosensitive epilepsy can          have seizures triggered by flickering or           flashing, particularly in the 4 to 59          flashes per second (Hertz) range.       Comment:        - I'd also like to move the note after the         checkpoint to the guideline prose or the         techniques document.     3f) Allow the user to configure the user agent        to render blinking images as motionless       images.      Comment:        - Addition control of blinking is not required.         Therefore, it is sufficient to stop the         blinking and render a motionless image instead.         4) PROPOSALS FOR GUIDELINE FOUR  Refer also to the previous proposal [5] for  changes to checkpoints in Guideline 4.      4a) Allow the user to stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and       fast reverse individual sources of audio, video, and animations       that last three or more seconds at their default       playback rate and that are not identified by the author        as style. The user must be able to control each source        recognized as distinct independently of others. [Priority 1].         Note: This checkpoint applies to content that is rendered         automatically or on request from the user. Respect          synchronization cues per checkpoint 2.4.         The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint by          allowing control of all audio, video, and         animations.      4b) Allow the user to slow the presentation rate        of individual sources of audio, video and animations         that are not identified by the author as        style. [Priority 1]         Note: The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint by          allowing the user to slow all audio, video, and         animations.       4c) Allow the user to stop, pause, resume,         fast advance, and fast reverse individual sources of         audio, video, and animations not covered by        checkpoint 4a [Priority 2].      4d) Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of         individual sources of audio, video, and animations         not covered by checkpoint 4b [Priority 2].    5) PROPOSAL FOR NEW CHECKPOINT ABOUT ACCESSIBLE     GENERATED CONTENT    In the 1 September Guidelines, checkpoint 2.7  (natural language) and checkpoint 2.5 (missing  text equivalents) require the user agent to  generate replacement content. The checkpoints  above also include a requirement to generate  placeholders (on configuration). I believe that  the Working Group has, up to now, assumed that any  content generated by the user agent in the  following circumstances must be accessible. I  propose to make this assumption explicit in the  following checkpoint:    <NEW>     Ensure that any content (i.e., any part of      the document object) generated by the user agent      conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines      1.0 [WCAG10]. This checkpoint is Priority 1 for      generated content that conforms Level A,     Priority 2 for generated content that conforms at     Level Double-A, and Priority 2 for generated     content that conforms at Level Triple-A.         Note: For example, if an image is used as       a place holder, ensure that the image has       a text equivalent per checkpoint 1.1 of       WCAG 1.0. Generated content includes content       that results from the repair of author-supplied        content (e.g., as required by checkpoint 2.5),       from a user configuration (e.g., refer to       checkpoint 2.7 and checkpoints in Guideline 3).  </NEW>    Comments:   - Checkpoint 1.3 of the ATAG 1.0 [6] reads:     "Ensure that when the tool automatically      generates markup it conforms to the W3C's Web      Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]."     This ATAG checkpoint has a relative priority.

      I'm forwarding the following URI [1] sent by Robert Neff to the  WCAG mailing list. This is an article in Federal Computer Week  about Adobe's announcement. I've quoted it below.     - Ian    [1] http://www.fcw.com/fcw/articles/2000/0821/web-adobe-08-25-00.asp    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    Adobe prepares accessible PDF reader     BY William Matthews   08/25/2000     As they prepare to comply with new requirements to make  Web sites readable by visually impaired users, federal  Webmasters point to a major concern - PDF files.    But Adobe Systems Inc., the company that invented  Portable Document Format, says a new version of its  Acrobat Reader will be available by spring. The new  version will make it possible for screen readers to  read many of the PDF files that are now unreadable,  said Rick Brown, accessibility chief at Adobe.    "The government uses PDF for scanning in old documents"  from the pre-electronic era so they can be viewed on  computer screens, Brown said. These are essentially  pictures of old pages and usually cannot be deciphered  by screen readers.    Other PDF files contain text as well as images. Screen  readers often can read the text, but not necessarily in  the same way it was arranged for viewers who have good    Adobe is designing its new reader to follow the logical  structure of each story. "Logical structure can  indicate precise reading order and improve navigation,  particularly for longer, complex documents," Adobe says  in a description of its future reader. The reader "will  be able to follow a single article from beginning to  end, much as a sighted person would flip through the  newspaper pages to continue reading an article," Adobe  says.    The new reader will work best with new PDF files,  especially those that have been designed with  accessibility in mind, Brown said. But the reader will  "attempt to make" old PDF files accessible to screen  readers as well.    Adobe also is developing "some automated authoring  tools that will make it very easy to create a PDF file  that?s accessible," Brown said.        

      David,    Thank you for the frame-related comments on the 16 July draft [1].  I have quoted your questions/comments and made some of my own below.  For editorial comments or suggestions such as cross references, I  added them directly to the document and they'll appear in the  next draft. I've also added questions that raise issues to  the issues list [2]    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990716/  [2] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html      or      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html    In quoted text below, David Poehlman comments are indicated by "*dp*".    [About the term "dependent user agent", section 3.1]  > *dp* is this still an issue that needs refinement?  it seems what is being  >described here as a dependant user agent is actually an assistive technology.     (My comments here apply to this particular comment of yours and others  related to assistive technology/dependent user agents.)    Some assistive technologies are dependent user agents. A special  keyboard,  though an assistive technology, is not a dependent user agent. I've  taken into account your question and cleaned up instances  of "dependent user agent" and "assistive technology" in the documnet.    >There is indeed a class of agents which might be called assistive user agents >which includes pwwebspeak and perhaps ibm home page reader?  So could we >substitute here and or talk about assistive technology as adding functionality or >enhancing or enabling interaction provided the ua is assistive technology aware >and compliant with operations standards?    We will never come up with a water-tight definition of user agent  or assistive technology. By defining conformance based on sets of  checkpoints, we sidestep the need for a precise definition - we are   arbitrarily choosing sets of checkpoints based on common and important  relationships between desktop graphical browsers and some assistive  technologies. The division in two may not suffice in that some software  may not fall neatly into one category or the other. This is a limitation  of this solution we've adopted. We can create other conformance  classes, but we have focused on two for the moment. It may even be  possible to define classes outside of the specification if and when  it becomes a Recommendation.     I would recommend advancing on this issue by documenting what software  the Working Group considers to fall into each category and what  does not. Anyone willing to take this action item?    [About orientation in frames, section 1.1]  > *dp* how many frames and what their names are is also   > helpful perhaps a list to pick from?    Added.     [About checkpoint 3.1]    >   3.1 Ensure that all product documentation conforms to the Web Content  >          Accessibility Guidelines.

I propose this note after the checkpoint:      "For example, when turned off, allow the user to refresh     the page manually instead (through the user interface)."      We might also mention a configurable schedule for this one.      Similarly, I also propose the following note after checkpoint 5.13     (auto forward on/off):      "For example, when turned off, offer a static link     to the target resource instead."    [About checkpoint 7.2]      > For dependent user agents. Ensure that the user has access to the    > content of an element selected by the user. [Priority 1]    >*dp* we might want to widen this a bit and add efect of focus to the rest of the >document here but we'll see how it looks elsewhere I refer here to frames >although it is not explicitly stated here and table is used as the example, it >could just as easily be frames that are used and as the focus changes within a >frame the other frame or frames may change as we know.       I've added a cross reference to checkpoint 10.1, which says to    notify users/software when document or view changes occur.    [About checkpoint 8.3]     >For dependent user agents. Allow the user to navigate among table     >cells of a table (notably left and right within a row and up     >and down within a column). [Priority 1]       >*dp* shouldn't this be a built in function of the graphical      >ua anyway since we don't know who will be using it?       The WG decided to make this for dependent user agents only and that     it sufficed for graphical desktop browsers to provide access to the     table structure through a standard API.     [About checkpoint 8.6]  > 8.6 Allow the user to navigate the document structure. [Priority 2]  > *dp* are frames part of the structure?    I would argue that they are not. The HTML WG and others felt that  frames were a visual presentation mechanism, not a structural mechanism.  CSS positioning captures most of what frames can do visually (except  setting  a target in a new window, for example). Note that a frameset does have  the useful property of allowing inclusions by reference. However, this  can also be achieved through the OBJECT element in HTML 4.0.    [About checkpoint 8.7]  >8.7 Allow the user to configure structured navigation. [Priority 3]  >    *dp* and beating it once again frames?    Yes, although this should be dealt with in checkpoint 8.1 about  frame navigation. The WG is expecting a proposal from Gregory  Rosmaita about configuration in general, so I'd like to  wait to see how it fits in with his proposal (refer to action item  in  [5]).

This one is also dropped in [6], but the example of frames  can be added to the new checkpoint on contextual info.

Eric, I'm surprised that you have focused on applicability this much.  I thought it was on the way out...    My primary concern with your comments is that they seem to change  significantly the intended scope of the document. Please bear in   mind that this document does not attempt (nor has it ever attempted)  to include requirements for user agents so that a conforming user  agent on its own would meet the needs of all users with disabilities.  Some of your proposals below suggest to me that you wish it did include  these requirements.

Is that a fair comparison?    IJ: We require in the claim that you indicate how many checkpoints      you consider don't apply.

IJ: I don't consider that the possibility that someone might abuse the  guidelines in this way means that there's a problem with the Guidelines.

IJ: I think it's a mistake to set a maximum number. I think it does  make sense to tell people that a bunch of inapplicable checkpoints is  a bad sign of ... applicability of the guidelines. Until the 18 August  draft, we had text to that effect. From the 28 July guidelines [1],  section 1.7:       This document has been designed to promote the accessibility      of general-purpose graphical user agents. While many of the      principles set forth in this document apply to other classes      of user agents, including assistive technologies, many of the      checkpoints do not. As the number of applicable checkpoints      decreases for a piece of software, the likelihood increases      that the guidelines are not an accurate gauge of the accessibility     of that piece of software.    I prefer this kind of warning to a hard and fast limit.    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000728/     > ====  >   > Suggestion 6.

IJ: That is because we very consciously chose to avoid requiring this  type of  dependency in a conformance claim between one vendor and another. Our  recent discussions about claims address the "right" to make such a  claim, but we have in the past not wanted to "require" interdependencies  (even while the actual interoperability is a good and important thing.).  If this document is aimed at developers of general purpose user agents,  then they should not "suffer" because assistive technology developers  are not holding up their end of the "bargain", due to say, a business  decision. In short, we decoupled vendors intentionally, after getting  confirmation from assitive technology vendors that the DOM and  other standard interfaces did in fact meet their needs and they were  interested in requiring that those APIs be implemented. That is as  far as we wanted to go.    > It  > appears to me that adherence to several checkpoints in Guideline 5 ("Observe  > system conventions and standard interfaces") fulfill critical prerequisites  > for operability by facilitating communication with such devices.

I am again concerned that this  > may not be adequate.    IJ: It may not be. However, we have chosen (so far) to not require  vendor  A's general purpose user agent conformance to depend (indeed, fluctuate)  based on the presence of, say, three interoperable products in the  market.  It is important that those products exist (otherwise we will have failed  in promoting accessibility). However, in terms of the *scope of this  document*, we have chosen not to include an interoperability  requirement.     > By the way, I think that we need to keep in mind that it is the checkpoints  > that constitute the normative part of guidelines.

IJ: I would STRONGLY (read: STRONGLY) object to adding these as  checkpoints to the document at this time. You are, in essence, asking  that a general purpose user agent (the focus of this document) also  be a specialized user agent for all of the functional limitations you  cite.  That would be an ENORMOUS change in the document, and inappropriate at  this  stage of the document's development.     I would not object at all at including this or similar text as  informative  material to educate readers, i.e., to explain that this is the goal  of the sum of software that a user may require for access.

I object.    1) 10.5 talks about single-key access, not general configuration.  2) 10.7 talks about saving configurations persistently  3) 10.9 talks about graphical UI configuration  4) 5.8 talks about following conventions    While 10.5 comes closest to ensuring configurability of the   keyboard, it is specifically for single-key access.

I do not agree with this one. I'm not convinced that saying   "continuous-time content" will inform many users about what these  checkpoints address.

      Hello,    Per our action item of the 9 Jan 2001 teleconference [1], Eric  and I have discussed the definitions of "animation",  "presentation" in light of issue 430 [2]. Please consider the  following proposals and questions based on that discussion. The  checkpoints in this email are those of the 16 Jan 2001 draft [3].     - Ian    [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0071.html  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#430  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010116/    -------------------------------------------------  Proposal 1: Delete the formal term "presentation"  -------------------------------------------------    A "presentation" may mean a number of things:     - A series of status slides that together convey a story;   - A video-only presentation (e.g., a silent movie);   - An audio-only presentation (e.g., a radio show);   - A synchronized collection of different pieces of content     (e.g., created in SMIL).       This last meaning is the one used in the glossary of the      16 January 2001 draft.    We might limit our usage of the term "presentation" to mean  "content with an inherent time component" (as opposed to one or  more static Web pages), but I don't think that we should. Rather,  I propose that:    a) We use the following terms instead of the catch-all    "presentation": audio, video, animation, animated image,     and synchronized content. I mention these because     they (should) all appear in checkpoints 4.4 and 4.5.    b) We may use the term "presentation" in an informal manner     (as one would in English) in UAAG 1.0, but we should     avoid it where a particular meaning might be inferred.    c) We delete the term "presentation" from the glossary.    -------------------------------------------------  Proposal 2: About animations  -------------------------------------------------    Refer to email sent to Chris Lilley requesting info  on animations:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0118.html    Suppose for the proposals below that the definition of "animation"  includes "animated images".    --------------------------  Proposal 3: Checkpoint 3.2  --------------------------    1) Do not broaden checkpoint 3.2 to include other animations     than animated images:      <OLD>        Allow the user to configure the user agent not to render       audio, video, or animated images except on explicit request       from the user.  In this configuration, provide an option to       render a placeholder in context for each unrendered source       of audio, video, or animated image. When placeholders are       rendered, allow the user to activate each placeholder       individually and replace it with the original       author-supplied content. [Priority 1]     </OLD>      Rationale: The "placeholder" requirements of 3.2 make it    difficult to imagine how this would be done for animations    in general, created through scripts, style sheets, and    markup languages. Note also that the user can control a more    general class of animations per the requirements of Guideline 4.    2) Change the content type label from "Animation" to "Image"     (since this is only about animated images).    --------------------------  Proposal 4: Checkpoint 3.4  --------------------------    1) Delete "motionless," since this is only about blinking.      <OLD>     Allow the user to configure the user agent to render blinking     images as motionless, unblinking images.    </OLD>      <NEW>     Allow the user to configure the user agent to render blinking     images as unblinking images.    </NEW>    2) Change the content type label from "Animation" to "Image"     (since this is only about animated images).    -------------------  Question about checkpoints 4.4/4.5/4.7/4.8  -------------------    Question: For checkpoints 4.4 and 4.5, are these checkpoints  intended to require control of synchronized multimedia  presentations?  Here are the checkpoints:     --------   4.4 Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of audio,   video and animations. For a visual track, provide at least   one setting between 40% and 60% of the original speed. For a   prerecorded audio track including audio-only presentations,   provide at least one setting between 75% and 80% of the   original speed. When the user agent allows the user to slow   the visual track of a synchronized multimedia presentation   to between 100% and 80% of its original speed, synchronize   the visual and audio tracks. Below 80%, the user agent is   not required to render the audio track. The user agent is   not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video and   animations whose recognized role is to create a purely   stylistic effect. [Priority 1]     4.5 Allow the user to stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and   fast reverse audio, video, and animations that last three or   more seconds at their default playback rate.  The user agent   is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video   and animations whose recognized role is to create a purely   stylistic effect. [Priority 1]   --------    Note also checkpoint 2.5:     2.5 Respect author-specified synchronization cues during   rendering.    This means that if the user slows down audio per checkpoint  4.4 and that audio is part of a synchronized presentation, then  the user agent should slow down the entire presentation  (respecting synchronization cues). Do other people have  the same understanding?     So:    1) If 4.4 (and/or 4.5) includes control over synchronized content,     should we make this clearer, or is the cross reference to       checkpoint 2.5 sufficient?    2) If 4.4 (and/or  4.5) does not include control over      synchronized content and only is about individual source sof     video, audio, or animation, then should we make this clearer?    I don't have a proposal for changing 4.4 and 4.5; I await  feedback from the WG.    Proposal:     - If animated images are a subclass of animations, then     checkpoints 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, and 4.8 require addition of      the "Image" content type label.      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

As I mentioned earlier, I think this is incomplete since UAAG  makes some requirements that are applicable and that  are meant for users with disabilities (e.g., implementation  of the DOM).     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

My mistake: 2.8 is not about "author has failed to provide"  but rather "author has intentionally provided empty conditional  content". That's what distinguishes 2.8 from 2.7.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    In reading the document today, I found checkpoints 5.6  and 8.7 slightly confusing. In the 10 March Proposed   Recommendation [1] these checkpoints read:    5.6 Implement selection, content focus, and user interface focus  mechanisms.           [Priority 1]     8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying active       elements (through a standard interface where available). [Priority  2]     1) First of all, 5.6 is in the Guideline about system conventions     and standard interfaces and yet says nothing about either of those.     However, the note after states that this checkpoint is a special     case of checkpoint 5.5., which is about using standard APIs     to provide access to user interface controls.       Proposed:       1) Move checkpoint 5.6 to Guideline 8 Orientation        (refer to part two of this message for more info).      2) Add to checkpoint 5.5 the same parenthetical already         in 5.7: "user interface controls (including selection,         content focus, and user interface focus)". This will         cover the intent of the Note after the current 5.6.    2) Second, 8.7 includes a confusing parenthetical: "(through a      standard interface where available)". It is hard to     tell whether this means through an API or through standard      mechanisms of the user interface.       I don't think it's about an API since that's covered     by checkpoint 5.5 (and if it is meant to be about     and API, we should delete it since it's covered     elsewhere). I think that this means "use standard      user interface controls to idnetify and highlight     active elements."        Therefore, I think 5.6 and 8.7 should be adjacent in     Guideline 8 and read:       a) Implement selection, content focus, and user interface         focus mechanisms [Priority 2]          Refer to checkpoint 5.9 about following conventions          for user interface design.       b) Provide a mechanism for identifying and highlighting        active elements. [Priority 2].          Note: On most systems, the focus is used for navigation                and activation of active elements.          Comment: This note already appears in the definition of                 "active element".         Alternatively, 5.6 could be moved to the section on navigation.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      30 May 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0218    Minutes of previous meeting 25 May:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0218    Next meetings: 31 May, 7 June.    Present:    Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (scribe), David Poehlman,    Denis Anson, Gregory Rosmaita, Jim Allan    Absent: Mickey Quenzer, Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets: Tim Lacy, Eric Hansen, Harvey Bingham     Reference document 25 May 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010525/    ----------  Discussion  ----------    ----------  Agenda for 31 May teleconference with assistive technology  developers  ----------    JG: I intend to send same survey as a year ago:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0488    GR: From UAAG 1.0:     "Note that the ability of conforming user agents to communicate well   with assistive technologies will depend in part on the willingness of   assistive technology developers to follow the same standards and   conventions for communication."    JG: Proposed agenda:     - Structure of document / changes in Guideline 6   - Review of previous survey    - Is MSAA necessary? Sufficient?    - Status of DOM implementations? DOM intentions?   - Interest in interoperability testing   - Security: We don't address, but good ideas are invited.   - Questions from AT developers.    IJ: I think we need to ask the question that AOL raised:   what do AT developers intend to implement?     DA: Have you spoken to Randy Marsden of Madentec?    ------  Issues  ------    #474: Is configuration required when the user agent always/never does  something anyway?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#474    Proposal:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0220    /* IJ reviews 3.3, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6 */    DA: Analogy: Is a ramp ok in all cases? Stairs may be more convenient,  but a ramp is probably ok in all cases. Similarly, the accessibility  mode in these cases works for everyone.    Resolved:     - It is sufficient to satisfy checkpoints 3.3, 5.1, 5.3,     5.5, and 5.6 without configuration as long as the user     agent provides the accessibility functionality.     - UAs should allow configuration.    #500: 4.6: When captions are positioned with constraints, how does  override work? Can captions be positioned in a separate viewport?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#500    Proposal:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0195    IJ: Other styles covered by other checkpoints.    JG: None of the current media players support the requirements of this  checkpoint. Windows Media Player always plays captions in a separate  viewport, but the captions are always just underneath the video.  If you move around, the viewport with the video moves too.    JG: Quicktime overlays text on the background of an image. "Key text"  allows authors to put the text track over a video track. With  Quicktime Pro, you can reposition where the captions are. You can have  two key text tracks. If one is larger than the video track, then you  can position it outside the region of the video track.     JG: So Quicktime lets you put the captions anywhere *on* the video,  but not outside of the video.    JG: I don't know how Quicktime handles positioning in the case of  SMIL.    JG: For SAMI, there's a hard-wired location.    JG: With RealPlayer, you can put a region wherever you want. But it's  not clear that the user agent would have to create a larger region to  position captions so that they don't overlap with the video track.    JG: So, what if the author didn't make space to move captions  off of the video, is the UA responsible for doing this?    IJ: I don't think so.    JG: So that means that the author needs to provide for space  both on and off the video track in the case of user agents  that support format-based positioning.    IJ: I don't think that we should require the user agent to "rewrite a  document to make it better."    Proposed:     - Adopt proposal with EH edit.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0205   - Clarify that last two sentences apply to both format case and     viewport case.    NO RESOLUTION    Action JG: Organize a teleconference to address 4.6 and invite media  people to attend.  For example: Rob Lanphier of RealNetworks, Kathy  Demaree of Microsoft (she is in charge of accessibility for the WMP),  Geoff Freed, and Cindy King.    #506: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3: How does one value work when different components  control different content?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#506    IJ: The point is that when a user agent module handles Web resources,  a global configuration in that module affects all resources that it  handles.    Resolved:     - Adopt proposal (with editorial tweaks).     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0221    #512: Checkpoint 4.1: Range of text sizes   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#512    Resolved:     - No lower bound due to I18N, hardware issues, individual     preferences.   - Clarify that small text size (and depends on     script) is not the intention of this checkpoint   - No exemption in the case of small text size since     we can't draw the line.    #513: Checkpoint 2.9: What if automatic rendering unspecified or  contradicts specification?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#513    IJ: A couple of options:     - Point out that 2.1 says "if the other spec contradicts UAAG 1.0,     you should / can violate the other spec in order to meet      the accessibility requirement."     - And 2.9 says "do what the spec says to satisfy this requirement,     otherwise do the following..."     IJ: In section 13.3.1 for OBJECT (HTML 4.01), it says      "[the user agent] should not render the element's contents, but it      must examine them ..."    JG: Furthermore, configuration not to render some types of objects  is one of the options (see bullet two of 13.3.1).    Resolved:     - No change.    #514: Checkpoint 1.1: If UA functionalities are keyboard operable,  must all UI controls be?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#514    IJ: In practice, most user agents enable keyboard operation of user  interface controls.     Resolved:        -Change 1.1 to state that the user must be able to operate with the     keyboard any functionality that is available through the user     interface (in some configuration).      - Typically, this will involve keyboard operation of user interface     controls in addition to direct keyboard operation of     functionalities.      - Direct keyboard operation alone may cause problems     due to the cognitive load of memorizing shortcuts. See Guideline     11 for configuration requirements.      ---------------------  Explicit user request  ---------------------    Proposal:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0223    JA: I think that if the submit button has focus or you select it, then  that should be considered an explicit user request. It doesn't matter  where the activation came from (e.g., AT or through the user  interface).    IJ: What about an onfocus handler attached to a button? It's not  an explicit user request in that case.    DA: Should the user agent correct for malicious design?    GR: It's not malicious as much as "photon-dependent" assumptions.    JG: In techniques document, we could mention configurations      to exempt specific categories (e.g., press on submit buttons).      Allow users to have more convenience by configuration.    JA: I have Ad-Blocker software for pop-up windows. This software  blocks all of them (even when I explicit request to open a viewport).    Resolved:     - For checkpoint 5.5:        - Change to be a configuration to prompt for any form submission.       IJ: No extra implementation burden, IMHO.     - In techniques, mention other configuration options.     - Adopt proposed definition of "explicit user request".     - Clarify in definition of "user agent user interface" that these   things are not part of content nor created by content; they are part   of the user agent.    ---------------------  Completed action items  ---------------------    2.IJ: Revise proposal to address Issue #474.    Source:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0164.html  Done:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0220    3.IJ: Mention "themes" in the section on configuration files (along   with profiles, init files).

A couple of comments:    1) I'm not sure it's necessary to distinguish what you are calling  "native content" from other content.    2) Does native content also exclude style, scripts, and binary     code? Does that amount to "human readable text"?      _ Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't think WCAG is way off, only that a slight clarification might  be useful:    1) Today, provide text equivalent and auditory description for visual  track     of a multimedia presentation.    2) When most UAs can generate speech on the fly from text, the text  equivalent     is necessary and sufficient.    - Ian         > Al  >   > > - Ian  > >  > >[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0337.html  > >--  > >Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  > >Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  > >Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783  > >    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Reference Document:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990617    1) The title "Scope of these Guidelines" confuses me.     This section discusses two things: (a) the audience     for the guidelines (b) what is meant by authoring     tool. I think 1.1 should be merged into the first     two paragraphs of the Introduction and follow     this outline:       - Authoring tools play a critical role      - Here's what we mean by authoring tool     - Markup must be accessible (cf. WAI-WEBCONTENT)     - Tool must promote accessible authoring practice       (e.g., by automating tasks)       Note: This proposal kind of subsumes one I           just sent on the Introduction text.         2) The term "Web format" is used several times, as is     "Web content". What's the difference?    3) In fourth bullet, propose adding the word "content"     after "multimedia".    4) I think section 1.2 should be dropped and replaced     by a section entitled "How the Guidelines are     Organized", as in the Web Content Accessibility and     UA Accessibility guidelines. Refer to [2].    [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#organization        

      WAI UA Telecon for 1 July 1999    Chair: Ian Jacobs  Scribe: Charles McCathieNevile  Time: 12:00 noon to 1:30 pm Eastern Standard Time  Call-in: W3C Tobin Bridge (+1) 617-252-7000)    If you have other agenda items you'd like to discuss,  let me know.    Regrets: Jon Gunderson, Rich Schwertdfeger, Mark Novak    Update on Open Action Items:     1) Action CMN: Send URI on default keyboard bindings to list. Ian                    will then include in Techniques document.     2) Action CMN: Send request to blinux users for info about orientation.     3) Action IJ: Send similar request to IG.     4) Action GG: Send ideas on dependent tool point of regard to list.     5) Action Editors:        - Add checkpoint about turning on/off author-supplied          keyboard bindings.        Status: Done in internal source files.    Agenda:    1) CMN proposes allowing the user to configure the arrangement of  user            interface controls (visually) as a P3.    2) Checkpoints for guideline 3, about documentation, should be P1.  having to     guess these things makes it effectively impossible.

      Hello,    As part of our Candidate Recommendation plan of action [1], we proposed  to improve our documentation of how well deployed user agents satisfy  the guidelines. In order to update the implementation report (latest  version 26 Jan 2000 [2]), please send any additional information you  have about how user agents satisfy the checkpoints, preferably with  links to evidence of implementation. In particular, we could use  information about Mac implementations.

      Hello,    The 9 July versions of the User Agent Guidelines [1] and techniques [2]  are now available on line as are the list of changes to the guidelines  [3]  and the techniques [4].    In this release, the tar and zip archives should be entirely  self-contained -  I wrote a little script to download all style sheets and images so  that the document may be viewed locally.    Also, some patches to html2ps mean that the postscript and pdf  versions should be better too.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19990709/  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/changes  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19990709/changes    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

Yes. Tim showed me a very simple drawing on his whiteboard once.  An arrow closed into a circle (with arrow head touching arrow tail).  The system modeled by the circle was the "old Web", where the system  sits and waits for user interaction (e.g., following a link). After  that action, the system waits again, completing one loop.    In the Semantic Web, there's another agent: the machine. The machine  can do some things automatically, allowing a lot of loops to happen  before the system stops again to wait for user input.     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

GR: Proposed useful baseline for deciding what's necessary for          single-key access: there are many single actions that          you find on a menu bar. Perhaps start by saying "For all          single actions enabled by the UI".        IJ: In Word, for example, you can put buttons for each          functionality on the tool bar.        RS: You probably want to exclude author-defined access keys.         GR: There's a difference between serial single-key strokes          and modifier keys (two at once).        JG: Doesn't seem to me to be impossible to active functionalities          without single key.        IJ: What does "single key" mean:       a) Not two keys at once?       b) Single action?

Yes, I think it would be disorienting to move from row N down one row  and find yourself in row N + 20. Instead, you might have to have  to have your position adjusted left or right. Cells (in the HTML model)  start in the row / column position where they are specified. They may  extend into the row or column (left or right depending on the table  direction).  In the case you describe above, I'd move the focus down one row  into the cell that happens to span that row.    That's how emacs seems to work when I move the cursor up and down  among lines of text of differing lengths (although I'm sure  this is configurable): If horizontal position N exists in line L + 1,  move the curor from L(N) to L+1(N). If not, move it from L(N) to  L+1(end-of-line).     _ Ian     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      7 June 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0245    Minutes of previous meeting 31 May:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0230    Next meeting: 14 June    Present: Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (scribe), Stephanie Potter  (RealNetworks), Erik Hodge (RealNetworks), Geoff Freed (WGBH),   Harvey Bingham, Mary Beth Janes (Apple), Mickey Quenzer,   David Poehlman, Cindy King (Gallaudet)    Regrets: Tim Lacy, Jim Allan, Eric Hansen, Gregory Rosmaita    Reference document 4 June 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010604/    ----------------------  Discussion  ----------------------    Issue 500: Checkpoint 4.6 positioning requirement.    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#500    Accessibility requirements:   * Move captions off of video (interference)   * Move captions over video track (low vision)    CK: One reason to allow for overlapping is that the author has not  provided the captions; a third-party has provided the captions. One  example is television.    IJ: People have asked us why top/bottom/left/right is not sufficient.    CK: If you have a video with wording already on it (e.g., there are  alerts at the bottom of the screen), you can't always assume that the  caption will go in a particular location (where there might be  critical location).    GF: I think that Quicktime does this already.    /* Ian introduces the issue */    EH: I'd like to speak to the points about system-captions:     * We're not making any plans to change our SMIL 1 behavior.   * We're working on our SMIL 2 implementation. (There are some     additional switches for subtitles.) The author places captions     in a particular location.     IJ: Is your concern override of author style or the reflow issue?    EH: The latter. Sometimes there are interdependencies. There is also  the ability within SMIL to move regions. The author can allow control  of regions (e.g., on keyboard events).    IJ: That's why we suggested that it would be possible to render the  captions in a separate viewport.    EH: Yes, that could be done.    IJ: The transparency part would be covered by control of foreground  and background colors (checkpoint 4.3, which is separate).     EH: In the Windows environment, this can be done: allowing one  viewport to show through another.    MBJ: I'm mostly here to take questions back to our group.    EH: If the author doesn't specify that the captions are in a separate  viewport, does the UAAG requirement still apply?     SP: Suppose the author creates a presentation with both video and  captions in the same viewport.    IJ: Our requirement still holds, and there are several implementation  options: same viewport, different viewport.    SP: It can get complicated if you pull, say, four different captions  out into four different viewports (e.g., in different languages or  multiple speakers, or a news presentation with one media window, one  window with a stock ticker).    IJ: But if the author can already specify that, why is it more  complicated?    SP: If it's allow only what the author can do, then that's less of a  problem.    IJ: Right, we don't require any more than what the author can do.    CK: Check out http://depts.gallaudet.edu/    /* IJ checks out this page, but it's almost empty... */    CK: Most of the time you want captions in a separate viewport. Authors  don't want their visual space left blank in cases where the users  don't want to view captions.    EH: Question: If you have captions below the video and the user  requests that the captions go in a separate viewport, would it go  against the spec if we left the text in place and created a separate  window?     IJ: I think it would be ok if the first captions were not overlapping  with the video, and the user wanted to move the (second) captions to  overlap the video.    HB: The one they move around would be enlarged text.     IJ: Why not allow two configurations:      1) view in place   2) view in separate viewport    IJ: Allow the user to toggle them independently. In short: the  tool already does what we want, but not always when we want it. We are  asking for configuration to do these things even when the author  hasn't said so.    MQ: A good reason to have captions in a separate viewport is to allow  users with screen access programs to zero in on specific information.    DP: Some users may find it confusing to have too many captions tracks  running simultaneously. Users may want to turn them on and off  independently.    GF: I was a little puzzled by the scenario where you have two captions  regions at once.    IJ: How important is transparency?    CK: Traditionally captions have a background. Having a black  background behind white lettering is preferred. We did some research a  few years back with deaf users. We did shadowing and other variations,  and, because of the video behind it, the users preferred a background.  I think transparency is an important option, but shouldn't be a  requirement.    EH: I think that whether you have a requirement for transparency or  not, our QA department would require it of us.    IJ: Our spec says:       "Note: When captions overlap the synchronized visual track, the user    should be able to view the visual track behind the captions."    IJ: I think we would need to be clearer that transparency should be a  configurable option.    /* Ian reads 4.6 of 4 June 2001 draft */    EH: Clarifying a: If the author can specify it, the user can?    IJ: Yes.    IJ: Is it reasonable to think of an implementation where the user can  change values in the DOM?    EH: The SMIL DOM will probably not be in the SMIL 2  Recommendation. We're interested in the SMIL DOM, however. We would  implement all DOM things in one effort. People want to read the DOM  data more than write values into the DOM.    /* Review of RN comments from 10 May */    RealNetworks:      "3.2 Difficult to apply to a SMIL playback environment in a useful    way.  Unlike HTML, *all* media (text included) is done as included    media which the SMIL engine itself has little knowledge of.    IJ: Wouldn't the player simply not hand off the content to another  plug-in?    EH: The SMIL player would have to query the server for information  about the content type. At that point, it could choose not to play the  information. It's not as simple as it sounds.    EH: Would silent playing satisfy 3.2?    IJ: Yes. We've talked about that explicitly.    RealNetworks:     "3.3 Seems mutually exclusive with 2.5.  May require changes to   client-server protocol for RealText, seems very difficult for Live   Text applications, and may not be possible in other settings."    IJ: We distinguish streaming content from animated presentation of  that content. E.g., movie subtitles are streamed but not animated.    EH: We use text as building blocks. But animation is about moving  glyphs. The problem with letting it be "still". E.g., a series of news  items that scroll up and constantly refresh.    IJ: We've already said you can drop packets.    EH: I'm ok with that.    EH: With a marquee, there's no concept of a line break.    EH: Would a source view be sufficient?    IJ: In my opinion, not ideal, but sufficient.    JG: Yes, I think that a source view would be sufficient. Casual users  may not realize that a source view would satisfy their needs. It seems  like there's an authoring issue here, as well.    JG: How much flexibility does the author have in breaking up the text  into chunks?    SP: Typically it will all be done in one request. Suppose you are  pulling content from a database.    EH: I think that streaming text format presentation should be done on  the client side.    IJ: Do you throw away received text content?    EH: There are configurations (loop=true) where we keep content. But in  general, we throw out content as soon as it's not visible any more.    MQ: But I may not have had time to read the text that's arriving.    IJ: In general, we say don't rely on the author's time specification.    DP: I'm not sure that real text can be used by a screen reader  anyway. In order for real text to work with screen readers, it would  have to be converted to something usable.    EH: You could create a realtext window that is 10k pixels high (for,  say, 1000 lines), and allow the user to scroll through it.    /* GF and EH are working on a new standard for streaming text */    GR: I've been coordinating this with the WAI PF WG.

      Hello,    After several hours of discussions today with Charles  and Eric Hansen, I would like to propose the following   changes to the document. The checkpoint numbers are those  of the 7 May Guidelines [1].    This proposal concerns "volume" related checkpoints. Here  are the checkpoints that include requirements for volume  control:    3.2 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of       background audio. [Priority 1]   3.4 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of       audio. [Priority 1]   4.8 Allow the user to configure the audio volume.       [Priority 2]   4.10 Allow the user to configure synthesized speech volume.       [Priority 1]     At the 8 June teleconference, we resolved to change  the priority of 4.8 to P1.    I propose changing the requirements embodied by  these three checkpoints to the following:     1) On/off control of global audio      (When audio is a distraction. This is a special       case of the second requirement, but can stand alone.)     2) Control of global audio volume      (For users who are hard of hearing and users for whom       audio is a distraction.)     3) Relative control of volume among audio objects.      (Currently, this is only applied to the particular       case of synthesized speech. For notes on discussion       about this requirement, refer to 8 June minutes [2].)    Note that checkpoint 3.2 is about "background audio". What is the  difference between turning off background audio and turning  off audio, except when background audio is an identifiable track  that may be turned off independently of other audio? I'm not  sure there is a difference, but to capture the requirement  of being able to make background audio go away, I propose   augmenting the scope of 4.10 to cover all audio objects.  Thus, we would end up with the following three priority  one checkpoints:    1) Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of audio.  2) Allow the user to configure the audio volume.   3) Allow the user to control the volume of audio sources     independently.    Notes:    1) The applicability clause is in effect here. Therefore,     if some other agent renders the audio, that agent is     responsible for volume control.    2) It might be possible to narrow the scope of checkpoint     three to the two cases already discussed in the document:     background audio and synthesized speech. However, defining     "background audio" is difficult and I don't know whether     life would be any easier on developers if we did. Does anyone     know of existing software where the user can control the     volume of different audio sources independently?        - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000507  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0429.html      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hi Eric,    Here's an argument against adding this: Section 1.2 of the 16 Jan  draft [1] includes this statement:       This document was designed specifically to improve      the accessibility of mainstream user agents with multimedia      capabilities for users with one or more disabilities      (including visual, hearing, physical, and cognitive).

I agree that this is the goal. However, if we ask how this is ensured,  the UA has to do something. Hence we immediately fall back on "The  user agent has to provide a mechanism..." The goal is user access,  but where possible, we're trying to tell UA developers what to do  to achieve that goal.    There  is only one checkpoint with the verb "ensure" in it  ("ensure that all functionalities are accessible through the keyboard").  "Ensure" is used in guideline text, where the goal can be emphasized  more than the means.    > Expose the current view, selection, and  > focus to assistive technology.    This is already covered explicitly in checkpoint 12.2:       Provide programmatic read and write access to user      agent functionalities and user interface controls     (including selection and focus) by using operating     system and development language accessibility      resources and conventions.        > If I have three views/frames/windows in a row, and the current view always  > contains the system caret and I can't select anything, is checkpoint 9.1  > satisfied?

      Hello,    In the 11 April 2001 draft [1] of UAAG 1.0, checkpoint 4.6 reads:      4.6 For graphical viewports, allow the user to position text         transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions in         the viewport. Allow the user to choose from among at least         the range of positions available to the author (e.g.,         the range of positions allowed by the markup or style         language).    Based on discussion and resolutions at the 19 April   2001 teleconference [2], I am trying to clarify the checkpoint.   The fully revised checkpoint is at the end of this email.    Things to take into account:    0) This checkpoint is about control of captions position with     respect to one or more synchronized visual tracks (and not     just any other piece of content). This checkpoint is      for graphical viewports only.    1) This checkpoint should only be about synchronized text tracks,     not [collated] text transcripts. I think the whole point of this     checkpoint is to ensure that synchronized information is both     legible and nearby. I think that in general, authors will specify     captions to accompany a visual track (in the same viewport), but     not transcripts.       Proposed: Drop text transcripts and collated text transcripts     from this checkpoint. Note that checkpoint 2.5 also refers to     [collated] text transcripts and should continue to do so: this     ensures that they are available at the same time as a visual     track.    2) Respect the author's positions and styles (e.g.,     colors, etc.) as expressed in the content. However, allow     the user to override the author's specified position.    4) The user agent is not required to lay out other content     (i.e., reflow) after the user has changed the position of     captions.    5) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup     language or style sheet language for control, then the user agent     must allow the user to choose from among at least the range of     positions enabled by the format.    6) If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint otherwise (e.g.,     by making available captions in a separate viewport), then     the user agent must:       a) Allow the user to position the captions to        overlap the visual track. The captions background        should be transparent to allow the visual track        to show through.        b) Allow the user to position the captions to        not overlap the visual track.    7) The checkpoint should allow for configuration or control.    Given all of this:    <NEW 4.6>     For graphical viewports, allow the user to position captions     with respect to synchronized visual tracks as follows: If the     user agent satisfies this checkpoint by using a markup     language or style sheet language to provide configuration or     control, then the user agent must allow the user to choose     from among at least the range of positions enabled by the     format. Otherwise, the user agent must allow both     non-overlapping and overlapping positions (e.g., by rendering     captions in a separate viewport that may be positioned on top     of the visual track). The user agent must allow the user to     override the author's specified position. The user agent is     not required to change the layout of other content (i.e.,     reflow) after the user has changed the position of captions.         Note: When captions overlap the synchronized visual track,       the user should be able to view the visual track behind        the captions. Refer to checkpoint 4.3 for requirements       related to the control of background colors.  </NEW 4.6>     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0046    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

By "appended to" you mean "at the very end of the page,  after all other links".     Can the append be changed to insert? It would not change the  behavior the mouse-user perceives in any case (since the mouse  user is not making use of the tab order).

      Hello,    As part of determining the minimal requirement [1]  for checkpoint 7.6 (navigation to important elements),  I sent a proposal [2] to include a list of the important  elements for known languages (e.g., HTML, SMIL)   in the Guidelines (though it may be more appropriate to  have markup language specific information in the Techniques  document). Here is a first draft at lists for HTML, SMIL, and SVG.    For HTML (drawing from the HTML 4.01 table of elements [3]):      a) Active elements: A, INPUT, BUTTON, OPTION, TEXTAREA    c) Headers: H1-H6    d) Frames: FRAME, NOFRAMES    e) Container elements: FIELDSET, OPTGROUP    f) TABLE, FORM, P, ADDRESS     Question: Should media objects be included (OBJECT, IMG)?             What about lists? DIV?    For SMIL  (drawing from the SMIL 1.0 DTD [4])      a) Active elements: a, anchor    b) Container elements: par, seq, switch     Question: Should media objects be included?    For SVG (drawing from the 29 June SVG Draft DTD [5]):    a) Active elements: a    b) Grouping element: g     Question: Should shapes be included (e.g., rect, circle, etc.)?    For MathML [6]?

      DOCUMENT IN REVIEW:     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/    Hello,    Charles McCathieNevile has proposed [1] the the UA guidelines  address support for natural language as an accessibility issue.  This proposal is lent support by the Web Content Accessibility  Guidelines [2], which contains two natural language-related   checkpoints - 6.1 and 6.2. Checkpoint 6.1 is a Priority 1  that reads:       6.1 Clearly identify changes in the (natural) language          of a document's text.    What form would UA checkpoints for natural language support  take?     1) One area seems to be related to descriptions and captions     of audio and video, but this will be covered in Guideline     5. by two proposed checkpoints (one to choose from among     available captions and descriptions for video, one for     audio). These checkpoints were added by consensus at     the 17 Feb teleconf.    2) Another checkpoint might mirror that of the Web Content     Guidelines: Notify the user when markup indicates a      change in natural language. In HTML, this is done     with "lang", in XML, I believe it's "xml:lang". This     feature could be turned on or off.    Other areas of concern for natural language?     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0237.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226   [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0206.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I'd also          suggest allowing a long time. Book extra time (3-4 weeks)          Note: CMN will be in the UA in April.           GR: Other WAI meetings around CSUN.        JG: WCAG may not meet then due to unavailability of chairs.         Possibly 27 March.       JG: Who's willing to go to a meeting late March, early April:         KB, CMN, DB, DA, GR, IJ, HB, JG.    4) Candidate Recommendation Preparation       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0049.html        HB: Do we get an early read from developers?       IJ: I think coordination is the piece that's missing in our         preparation for CR.       KB: The plan is reasonable.        DB: I will coordinate with IE Team.       GR: JG should contact MH at ProdWorks.       GR: I can work with Dolphin.       GR: I can talk to H?kon (since I'm a beta tester). How would         we handle a review of a beta-version?       IJ: I will talk to H?kon.      CMN: I'll be talking to RealNetworks people in Seattle.       JG: Other Netscape contacts?       GR: Mozilla?         JR: We can talk to IBM contacts about Mozilla.       Schedule for CR:       IJ: Probably not ready for CR 14 January. Will try for following  week.    5) User Agent Responsibilities Document       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/01/ua-resp-20000109        GR: I like the direction it's taking.       JG: Send comments to the list.    6) Issue LC#162: Raise priority of 8.9 (consistency in configs) to P2.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#162         KB: How will developers say that they meet this checkpoint?     JG: How much consistency is required?     IJ: Seems like usability, not accessibility to me.     GR: If the configuration changes significantly, it should be noted         in documentation and README.     IJ: Seems like definition of P3 applies.     DA: Can be a bigger problem for users with cognitive difficulties.         Rearranging controls makes it very difficult.     KB: Is documentation of changes more important?     IJ: Another factor - difficulty of establishing minimal         requirement.     JG: If the change makes using the tool easier, but there is         inconsistency, what do you do?     DA/GR: I think it's arguably a P2, but we do have a problem with         identifying how you meet it.     CMN: My gut feeling is P2, but not sure.      JA: Same here. It's hard to nail down which direction to go on this.      GR: We need to point developers to the other aspects of the          question, notably documentation of changes.      HB: I think P3 is ok.      DB: I think P3 is ok.      KB: This falls to me in the category of general UI design.           Proposed:              - Delete checkpoint 8.9. Move discussion to guideline  rationale                or principles of accessible design.              - Talk about documentation of changes in G11.      DA: We're trying to say: don't make arbitrary changes. Will that  being         in prose alone make it clear that this is an accessibility         issue?        GR: I'm ok with deleting the checkpoint as long as clearly          indicate that documentation important.        DA: I still think it's a significant issue, even if it's in the          documentation. It's a burden beyond the documentation.        KB: I agree that it's an important issue.        IJ: Proposed:          - Delete 8.9          - Add a checkpoint in documentation (P3)?        GR: Dolphin offers compatibility modes. This has boosted their          sales. Propose adding a technique to configuration checkpoint          about compatibility with previous UIs.        Resolved:          - In principles of design, add consistency to list of             good design ideas.          - Delete 8.9          - Add a P2 checkpoint in G11 about documenting changes          - Add a technique to config checkpoint about compatibility            modes.       Action IJ: Update document with these changes.    7) Issue LC#166: Review priority of 10.5 (default configs that interfere  with     OS conventions)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#166         IJ: 10.5 in 20 Dec 1999 draft.     DA: If the OS intercepts keystrokes, the UA won't see those         inputs.     JG: But that's the same for everyone.     DA: But may be an accessibility if you can do it through mouse but         not keyboard.     KB: That's covered by 1.1     GR: Do we have "mobility access keyboard modifiers reserved for         the operating system" in the techniques document?     JB: I think in the appendix.     GR: Based on the second sentence it's a P1 item. (e.g., breaking         accessibility input methods).        Resolved:         - Change 10.5 to P1 "Avoid default input configurations that                  interfere with operating system accessibility  conventions."         - Move first sentence of note afterwards to techniques for 5.6       Action IJ: Update document with these changes.    8) Issue LC#175: Proposed raise (to P1) of checkpoint 4.18        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#175        IJ: 4.15 in 20 Dec draft.     GR: In the absence of notification, serious accessibility problems.         People think that their history mechanism is broken. People         often work around by shutting down the browser window.     DB: I think it's inconvenient, but not impossible. P2.     GR: The key point is knowing; not the event itself.       Resolved:         - Leave P2       - Move "SMIL" example in Note to techniques. (Ian to simplify)       - Add cross-ref from 4.15 to 9.1       Action IJ: Update document with these changes    9) Issue LC#176: Proposed change in priority (P3 to P2) for checkpoint  8.7     (link information)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#176        IJ: 8.3 in 20 December draft.        KB: If a UA implements CSS, do they meet this checkpoint?     IJ: If pseudo-elements supported.     DA: If you have a page with lots of links, if you don't have          a way to know which you've visited, you have to memorize that         and it's difficult to access the data.     GR: There are a lot of superfluous links on pages, notably portal         pages.     DA: I think it's a P2.     GR: I think P1, but can live with P2.     JA: I think it's a P2.     HB: I think it's a P2.     DB: I think it's a P2.       Proposed:          - Make 8.3 and 8.7 P2.       DB: I have a reservation about making 8.7 P2. I think  developers         might not add features because of this.       DA: You can't find a way to present link information that is          accessible to everyone.        GR: Refer to section 3.3 of techniques document (link techniques)       KB: Do we have a checkpoint for link presentation?       IJ: Yes: 8.6       KB: If the UA supports CSS, does that suffice? Or does the UA         also have to provide a piece of UI for presenting information?         Or must the default style sheet display all information?       Consensus:       - The concept is P2.       - Problems with ambiguity of the checkpoint.         There may be some implementation problems.       - Configuration less important if UA makes right choice         about what information to present.       Action GR: Send screen shot of JFW link view.       Resolved:         - Add (back the old)          checkpoint for visited/unvisited links P2. If you don't have         access to that information is to follow a link and then return.         For complex pages, this becomes an unreasonable burden for         people with non-graphical browsers or cognitive disabilities.          - Leave 8.3 and 8.7 as is (removing visited).       Action IJ: Update document with these changes.

Your suggestion 4 was considered at one point. We did not include  a checkpoint for the following reasons:    1) Support for basic presentation features affects all users, therefore,     it's not a requirement for an accessible user agent.    2) We do require conformance to implemented specifications, and those     specifications say what to do in the way of presentation,  interaction,     etc.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hello,    It is true that the Web Content Working Group anticipates  upating the techniques document more frequently than  the guidelines. Note that it can't be too frequently, because  the document has to be somewhat stable as well.     While any translations are appreciated, I realize that it  would be more difficult to translate a changing document.   On the other hand, since the techniques document contains   a lot of HTML examples, the amount of English may not be  that much.    I think it is much more important to translate the guidelines  than the techniques. But if resources are available, all  translations are welcome.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Telephone May 1999 only:     (212) 688-4489  Cell phone May 1999:         (917) 450-8783  Otherwise Tel/Fax:           (212) 684-1814

There needs to be    an option to allow the user to say one of:     a) If the author has specified a font family, use that. If        not, use my font family (over the UA's default), or     b) Always use my font family over the author's specified        font family or UA default font family.    Netscape 4.73 allows me a little more control: The choice of  two font families: one for fixed-width fonts and one for   variable width fonts. I don't really know how the UA distinguishes  the two (it can be done in CSS, but I don't know how it works  in the HTML FONT element case).     - Ian         > Jon  >   > At 02:18 PM 7/25/2000 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Jon Gunderson wrote:  > > >  > > > >  > > > >4.1 Allow the user to configure and control  > > > >     the size of paragraph text.

Sean,    Thank you for making your site accessible! The problem you cite is  a browser issue (how they print) and a CSS support issue. The only  information I know of provided by this Working Group about user  agent support for style sheets is in the "User Agent Support   for Accessibility" page [1]. In that page, there are some links  to resources where you may find more information about support  for style sheets.    Hope this helps,     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

To address this point in particular, I propose that we add a checkpoint  whose language echos that of Candidate Rec [1], checkpoint 5.2:       Provide programmatic read and write access to content using standard     APIs  (e.g., platform-independent APIs such as the W3C DOM, standard      APIs for the operating system, and conventions for programming      languages) [Priority 1]     Then, the checkpoint requiring DOM for access to content would be an  important  special case of this checkpoint (and both would be priority 1). A note  would  indicate that for XML and HTML, satisfaction of the DOM requirement  would meet  the more general checkpoint.     - Ian    > [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128/  > [2] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#190  > [3] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#194  > --  > Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  > Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  > Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      UA/GL teleconference to coordinate issues  26 August 1999    Present:    Gregg Vanderheiden  Chuck Letourneau  Wendy Chisholm  Ian Jacobs  Al Gilman  Jon Gunderson  Charles McCathieNevile  Gregory Rosmaita  Jason White  Marja Koivunen  Dean Denman (The Lighthouse, joined after 1 hour).    Next scheduled meeting of GL WG: 9 September.       Note 1: We will try to schedule a meeting for 2 September.            If we can schedule this meeting, we will invite            UA to join the GL call to discuss outstanding            issues on 9 September.      Note 2: Meetings will henceforth last 90 minutes.    Agenda [1]  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/19990826.html#agenda    ----------------------  1) Review of action items  2) Navigation bars  3) Long description media types  4) Specificity of checkpoint 1.5  5) Metadata [Not covered]  ----------------------    1) Review of action items.     (Previous minutes)     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0266.html       CL: Talked to Coodination Group about a standard set of          questions for Web development "instructors".          Judy said good idea, and falls within EO, but no         time to address this today.       JW: Two other points made as well:         a) EO has clarification of guidelines on their agenda         b) Concerns about "scope creep" for GL.       WC: Rob sent a note to GL with questions.        2) Navigation bars       JW: Al's suggestion [1] regarding a mode in which DIV/title         can be regarded as a container that can be skipped         is a valid suggestion. I do have reservations about         the use of MAP to contain navigational links. Don't         want to use this unless in a spec. Could propose to          HTML WG, but don't want to endorse without making         it part of the specification.           Furthermore, future technologies (schemas) will allow         us to do this correctly.       [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0293.html       CMN:          a) For DIV/title: It's a backwards step. It's the navigational          equivalent of using FONT everywhere to create structural          illusions.         b) For MAP: The suggestion comes directly from the HTML 4.0           specification [2]. Shows how to use MAP with straight text.          Similar situation as we were in with longdesc. We recommended          that people used d-links until longdesc was supported.           Similar with MAP: use of MAP as block-level container          is supported - it is rendered. HTML 4.01 has this.            [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html/struct/objects.html#h-13.6         c) The "skip navbar link" is a hack that is similar to          the d-link. Useful if understood by humans, but not          machine recognizable.       GV: (Scribe missed comments)       JW: About DIV - it's a container element for style sheets         and other purposes. When it does this, in an outline         reading of the document, it should appear as part of         outline.        WC: DIV with a human-readable title is a bridge to XML.         Are there other elements that need to be grouped (e.g.,         images)?       CMN: But using DIV this way takes you out of the "standard"         hierarchy. So it's like the XML approach, but it's not         XML. So use xhtml instead.        IJ:         a) For medium term: use schemas. Don't focus on HTML           but move towards xhtml + schemas.        b) For immediate: use scripts (for example).          What problem are we trying to solve?        GV:         a) We can add additional functionalities to existing           browsers (plug-ins). So don't focus only on short-term           solution.          b) What strategies apply today?        JW: I see DIV as the only short-term generic solution          for adding structure that we're looking for. I think          the long-term solutions should be schemas.          IJ (to CMN): How does DIV/title strike you in the short term?                CMN: Marginally inferior to MAP/title solution.           HTML 4.0 doesn't say explicitly that you don't            need an image. CMN notes: MAP content is rendered           by all browsers I've tested but Amaya.         IJ: HTML 4.01 language of 13.6.1 section on rendering           of block-level content of MAP is new. Since HTML 4.01           in PR now, good time to ask an AC member to add           a phrase that would be helpful to address this            issue (e.g., no image necessary, "should" render           content).         JW: Two times to render content:              a) Image map not represented in display medium.             b) No image associated with MAP element.            So I propose adding to HTML 4.01 a comment about          rendering MAP block content along the lines of          "The user agent should render MAP content, notably           when there is no associated image." (Note           use of "should".)            [Scribe note: Suppose the user were able to          configure the browser to render or not to           render block content in a MAP element. UAs would          not be able to render a document progressively          in "don't render block content"  mode since that          would imply having to wait for all images (in          fact, all content) to know whether the MAP was           associated with any of them.]         CMN: What about OBJECT element? If you want to do what         Jason suggests, do this:                <OBJECT data="image.gif">                  <MAP name="foo">                 ...block content...                </MAP>              </OBJECT>            Doing this, you get links instead of the image (if         MAP content is rendered).         GV: Are we trying to push understanding of MAP to         far? Is this just a loophole we are exploiting?         AG: HTML 4's intention was to allow authors to          specify URLs one time only.         CMN: Also to allow image maps or text links, both based          on a single element content. The spec allows this, but          doesn't say that you can do this even if you never           intended to use an image.               GV: What about case of bulleted list of links? You           wouldn't want to put that in a MAP.         CMN: Users approach these lists differently than          navbars.         JW: I'd like to separate          a) How MAP is defined          b) Technique of when it should be used for             grouping links. Author discretion enters here.          MK: There can be a lot of navbars in a document          (e.g., CNN site). Users want to be able not          just to skip, but to return to navbars.         WC: For DIV/title, if author puts information           in "title", UA can present this information to           the user.        CMN: MAP/title will allow the same thing.         JW: With appropriate wording in HTML 4.01,           I'd agree with Charles' proposal. Otherwise,           I'd opt for DIV with title.         IJ: What about scripts?         AG: Problem of Lynx, which doesn't support scripts.        CMN: Then include a "skip nav bar" in the block of           links. But this pushes the problem from one           of listening to physically tabbing through a list           of links. The "skip nav bar" approach is still           the solution here. Or use a browser with a structure           view (e.g., Amaya).         WG: So first link inside of MAP is to jump over the           others?        CMN: So this will work today (e.g., with scripts, CSS)           and tomorrow. Also, use an image map up front and           text links at the bottom.           Conclusion:       a) For today, use MAP/title. Put a link in the MAP          to skip over the others. Use CSS or scripting          to hide it. Also, put image map at the top and          text links at the bottom.            WC: Some bugs using tabindex within frames in               at least IE 5. Don't believe supported in NN 4.0          b) For tomorrow: Use MAP with semantics as written in the          spec.             JW: Ask PF WG to consider this scenario and other            structural navigation issues when considering            schemas.         Actions:          1) CMN: Raise awareness with AC Members about enhancing                accessibility in HTML 4.01.             JW: I will dissent use of MAP unless the update               is made to HTML 4.01.          2)  WC: Propose techniques based on this discussion.           JG: Does this discussion represent consensus between UA and GL?        WC: No. I will write up the GL side of this discussion, send          to GL for comments, then send to UA.        CMN: UAs should expect to find MAP if they expect to           skip blocks of links.         MK: What about getting to the central content of the page?         AG: You may find repeated MAP elements, but you won't, from           this proposal, know how to find the primary content.           There are undoubtedly refinements to be made.           3) Long description media types             See Al's proposal. [3]     [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0297.html       GV: longdesc was designed to lead to something really         accessible. Other than "why limit it if we         don't have to", what's the benefit for making         this more than text?       AG: We're trying not to make it different than a standard         URI reference, which doesn't limit to a specific         media type.       IJ: But no "type" attribute with longdesc.       GV: But putting audio at the end of longdesc         raises barriers.       AG: But to meet WCAG, you'd need an auditory         description to accompany the audio clip.       JW: I don't think it's approprite to limit content         types for longdesc in an HTML spec. I think          the WCAG should have jurisdiction.       MK: "longdesc" also used in SMIL.       GV: I'd like to register nervousness on this point.         I fear people will put content out their that         will impose too many layers before getting to         accessible content.       IJ: Drop longdesc from SMIL and use schemas.      CMN: Drop IMG entirely.      /* Chuck leaves the call */       JW: In response to Greg's concern, I'd be willing         to have non-normative language in an HTML         spec that longdesc generally points to text.       GV: Use the Techniques Doc to address the longdesc         issue.      CMN: Having text is nowhere near as good as having         full markup: Put HTML at the end of a longdesc.       GV: Why use a movie at the end of a longdesc?      CMN: E.g., instructional videos.        GV: Why not put it on the main page?       CMN: No particular way to do it. The primary version         may be images plus text. The decision of         what is main and what is secondary is up to the         author.       IJ: This sounds like a cognitive technique: put text         as primary content, video as complement.       JW: Longdesc should not designate plain text alone,         but markup.      CMN: Yes, at a minimum, refer to markup.       JW: But this should not be normative in the HTML spec.       GV: We need to talk about the purpose of longdesc:         should limit it to a description of the image, not         supplemental information about the context in which         the image occurs. Similar to using alt text just         for the purposes of a tool tip. Warning: if the         function goes beyond a description of the image,         this could lead to problems.

I don't think that the checkpoints of Guideline 12 can be  reduced to one checkpoint. The requirements are:     a) What must be documented:      - feature that benefit accessibility (12.2)      - the default input configuration (12.3)      - software releases that affect accessibility (12.5)        Our definition of "documentation" is not normative.      Only the above checkpoints make requirements about      what's in the documentation.     b) How the documentation must be organized:      - it must have a section just about features        that benefit accessibility (12.4).     c) Finally, the documentation must conform to WCAG (12.1).     - Ian     --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

Here's what the Web Content Guidelines says:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  The content of a document refers to what it says to the user through  natural language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc. The structure  of a document is how it is  organized logically (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of  contents, etc.). An element (e.g., P, STRONG, BLOCKQUOTE in HTML) that  specifies document  structure is called a structural element. The presentation of a document  is how the document is rendered (e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional  graphical presentation, as an  text-only presentation, as synthesized speech, as braille, etc.) An  element that specifies document presentation (e.g., B, FONT, CENTER) is  called a presentation element.     Consider a document header, for example. The content of the header is  what the header says (e.g., "Sailboats"). In HTML, the header is a  structural element marked up with,  for example, an H2 element. Finally, the presentation of the header  might be a bold block text in the margin, a centered line of text, a  title spoken with a certain voice style  (like an aural font), etc.   </BLOCKQUOTE>     -Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

It was very hard to separate the issues because of the way the  word "equivalent" is already defined in the document. We could  not simply use the word "equivalent" in 2.3 and say "provide  access to each element of each set of things considered equivalent"  because "equivalent" has built-in meaning related to accessibility  in the document.    Therefore, we chose another word: "alternative". We didn't  touch the definition of equivalent.     - Ian      > At 07:36 PM 2000-10-27 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Hello,  > >  > >Per our action item of the 26 October teleconference [1] related  > >to issue 321 [0], Eric and I would like to propose the following  > >change to checkpoint 2.3 (from the 23 October draft [2]).  > >The change uses the term "alternative" instead of "equivalent"  > >and we explain why below.  > >  > ><OLD>  > >2.3 Provide easy access to each equivalent and each equivalency target  > >through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing  > >configuration to render the equivalent instead of the equivalency  > >target; (2) allowing configuration to render the equivalent in  > >addition to the equivalency target; (3) allowing the user to select  > >the equivalency target and then inspect its equivalents; (4) providing  > >a direct link to the equivalent in content, just before or after the  > >equivalency target in document order.

      Hello,    Issue 195 [1] states that reviewers of the Candidate Recommendation [2]  had difficulties understanding the wording of checkpoint 1.5:    <BLOCKQUOTE>    1.5 Ensure that the user interface provides information through         redundant output modes. [Priority 1]   </BLOCKQUOTE>    Therefore I propose this clarification:    <BLOCKQUOTE>    1.5 Ensure that the user interface presents information through        more than one output mechanism.          (Note afterwards):        For example, alert the user to an event with a graphical        cue, and an audio cue, and a text message on the status bar.        Refer also to checkpoint 5.4.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    Also, we can add to the techniques document that the user may want   to configure the output modes.     - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#195  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hi Mark,    I don't believe the current version of the techniques document [1]  is different with respect to the above paragraph. The editors  would welcome any effort to:    1) Reduce redundancy in sections (now numbered) 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3.           Can we abstract the features and describe them one time? Then,     in subsections dedicated to each platform, we can simply state     which features are supported and any differences from the  abstractions.     This would make the document easier to read and reduce the chance     of error.    2) Establish a definitive and correct list of features.    Please let us know if you want to take a stab at this.    Thanks in advance,     - Ian    [1]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981030/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

For these people, the single command qua a-singular-user-input doesn't  work.     Also, as you indicate that it's more difficult to define the concept  that you have touched on. I don't think it's worth the effort since  I think we can get along without it.     I like Jon's suggestion that   one checkpoint should address the keyboard-specific needs indicated  above (motion across the keyboard + keys in combination) and  that this checkpoint only be about single key press access.    After that, I think that the other checkpoints can be specified  without recourse to a hard-to-define concept.     _ Ian     > While it will be more difficult to define, I'd suggest that a "single command"  > encompass "a-singular-user-input  to  a-user- agent-action".

The format  you get depends on what our server and your client agree on  (we make both PNG and GIF available, and probably will  add SVG as the number of SVG clients grows). In fact,  I believe our server is configured to suggest PNG first,  then GIF.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I feel very strongly the opposite of that "might be thinking":  the author is the sole arbiter of what the author thinks  is important. And the author designs pages based on what  is important to the author. The author should consider  usability to be important.     _Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The Authoring Tool Guidelines includes references to accessibility  guidelines for different platforms. (Refer to [1], Guideline 7).  Perhaps the UAGL should adopt checkpoint 7.1:    7.1 Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards and  conventions      (Priority 1 for standards and conventions that are        essential to accessibility, Priority 2 for those that       are important to accessibility, Priority 3 for those        that are beneficial to accessibility).

Checkpoint 10.3 is about user control of keyboard, voice, and other  input configurations.

ONE GENERAL COMMENT ON YOUR COMMENTS:    You apparently have an entirely different model for organizing  the checkpoints in mind. It would be useful to me if you  were to repropose each Guideline based on the model you have  in mind. In short, how would your table of contents for the  Guidelines look read?    > SPECIFIC COMMENTS  >   > Section 1.5  >   > A.

This is out of scope. The information you would like should appear in  a FAQ about the Guidelines, stating precisely that these Guidelines  are *not* law and explaining how they might be referenced. Refer to  issue 7 of the WCAG Fact Sheet [3] that was published when WCAG became a  Recommendation in May 1999:    <QUOTE>  11. Will these guidelines become a requirement? Are there legal  consequences       for not making accessible pages?   </QUOTE>    We could certainly make similar clarifications in a UAGL Fact sheet.

It's a good point though so move it to the note  > or Techniques document.    The second sentence:    <QUOTE>  User agents are not required to reimplement low-level  functionalities (e.g., for character input or pointer motion)  that are inherently bound to a particular API and most   naturally accomplished with that API.  </QUOTE>    Has been included to address the concern expressed by some that  people might think checkpoint 1.1 means that users have to be  able to enter text with the mouse. If we move the sentence to  an informative note or the techniques document, the "requirement"  is lost. So it has been included directly in the checkpoint as  a clarification. If it's not clarifying anything, we may need  to change the wording.       > Guideline #2  >   > A. In the description paragraphs, are there formats from other areas that  >    should be called out?

SMIL and HTML are listed as examples, and while I wouldn't want the  rationale section to grow too much, nothing prevents us from including  references to other technologies. It would be even more appropriate  to do so in the Techniques Document, but we have not had the resources  to address more than SMIL, CSS, and HTML for now. SVG and XML should  be included soon.     We are always welcoming text for the Techniques document, so if you  have proposals, don't hesitate to send them.       > Checkpoint 2.3 - I think of speech recognition when I see the term  > natural language.

The term "natural language" is defined in the glossary of the  Guidelines,  so technically speaking you don't have to "leave the guidelines" to  find that information.(There could be more links to the term from  the checkpoints; I'll add them.) Or do you mean that you don't even want  to have to consult the glossary?    Natural language is not limited to speech synthesis or voice input.  The term is meant to refer to human languages that are spoken,  written, or signed.     One way to render content according to natural language markup is  to use an appropriate font family. Another is to render as speech  using the appropriate speech dictionary.     > Checkpoint 2.7 - What if the object isn't video or audio? Is this  > checkpoint just for timed media or does it cover things like graphics  > or interactive objects that say nothing about themselves?    The checkpoint reads: "When no text equivalent has been supplied,   indicate what type of object is present."    This applies to any object for which an alternative equivalent  has not been provided.    > Checkpoint 2.9 - Natural language again.

Again, I don't think this is limited to speech recognition. I hope  the glossary definition will suffice, but if you think further  clarification  is necessary, please let us know.     > Guideline #3  >   > A. A number of the checkpoints mention rendering.

Meta-comment: It is true that some checkpoints might appear logically  in more than one location. We've tried to group tightly related  checkpoints  even though one or more might appear in other Guidelines and still make  sense.     Also, another reviewer has asked that the Guidelines and checkpoints  be more clearly divided along the lines of "Accessible content"  and "Accessible User Interface". [This comment was made to me,  by Phill Jenkins at an Authoring Tool Guidelines meeting  in Cambridge a couple of months ago.]    While the WG has already chosen this order for the Guidelines  (refer to Issue 59 [4]), the Working Group might consider further  cleanup.

My personal take is: the guidelines should remain vendor/platform  neutral where possible. MSAA and JAAPI are implementations of the  checkpoints and as such appear in the Techniques document. DOM is  required explicitly, so is mentioned in the Guidelines. It is true  that HTML, SMIL, and other markup languages are not required in  the Guidelines document; they are examples only. There are checkpoints  for style sheets explicitly, so CSS and XSL could appear in the  Guidelines.    This merits some discussion.

General related document comment: the guidelines contain both  >       specific and general guidelines all mixed together.    Do you mean general checkpoints or guidelines? Assuming you mean  checkpoints, the answer is: yes, there is a mix. First of all,  I don't know what it would mean (or how one would know) that all  the checkpoints have the same level of precision/generality.    Some of the generality has been included to allow for flexibility.  Some of the precision has been included to address particular needs.    >       The Techniques document provides clarity on some of the general ones  >       but not all.  >         a. How will the developer know when they have successfully met  >            those guidelines like the above?    There is no absolute measure. I think the standard should be  something like "a reasonable person, shown evidence, would   agree that the checkpoint has been met." The issue of "who  determines conformance" is one that is being addressed in the  WAI Coordination Group.    >         b.

It's not a seal of approval from W3C; it's an icon that represents  someone's  belief that a UA does or doesn't meet the requirements of the document.  I think the analogy is quite strong with case law: much is left open to  (and relies on) interpretation, review, and communication.     > Guideline #6  >   > A.

We could move checkpoints around to match that expectation:    1) Move checkpoint 5.6 (DOM) to G6.  2) Move checkpoint 5.5 (promgrammatic notification) to G9 on  notification     (will that be consistent with other checkpoints in G9? to be  verified...)  3) Checkpoint 5.1 needs clarification anyway.  4) Checkpoint 5.7 (timely notification) refers to "information", which     may be about content or controls. That could stay in G5 and, having     moved 5.6 to G6, we could refer to it from the DOM checkpoint.    That would leave all G5 checkpoints about the UI.    Thoughts?    > Guideline #7  >   > A.

User  agents can actually generate useful information (such as a structured  view). Some of the checkpoints in this section refer explicitly to  "author-supplied" information where that is meant.

If  it leaves the viewport and the viewport doesn't follow, a user  could become disoriented. Therefore, the viewport should follow  changes to the selection or focus.    However, saying "The viewport should follow changes to the selction  or focus" doesn't capture the key piece: the selection or focus  must be in the viewport after the change.       > Guideline #10  >   > A.

The Techniques document [1] already points this out. The first  bullet for checkpoint 11.4:      "In some modes of interaction (e.g., when the user is entering      text), the number of available single keys will be      significantly reduced. The number of available single keys     will also be determined by the keyboard device capabilities."     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010323/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      13 July 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Harvey Bingham   David Poehlman   Kitch Barnicle   Mickey Quenzer   Tim Lacy   Dick Brown   Gregory Rosmaita   Eric Hansen   Charles McCathieNevile   Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets:   Mark Novak   Jim Allan    Next meeting: 20 July.    Regrets for August: Jim Allan      Agenda [1]  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0038.html    Discussion        0. IJ: I talked with MAC IE developer Tantek ?elik about the UA         Guidelines. I will send comments about this discussion and          issues raised to the list.        1. Please comment on 7 July 2000 Working Draft.         http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707         a)  HB: Has there been any effort to harmonize definitions        across guidelines?           IJ: Yes.           GR: I recommend taking this to EO.        GR: I reviewed the draft and am still concerned about speech            characteristics being a P2. We may be missing the needs of            some people.          /* Discussion of increments for 4.11 */          Resolved: Change 4.11 to 5% increments.         b) Definitions          EH: To help break logjam in defining some of these issues,       I think we should define "primary content" to be content intended       to be used by people without any disability. Until conventions       are established for indicating that content is primary or  alternative,       that certain assumptions should be made. For example, if you have       content in the "alt" attribute, we assume that that's       alternative. Same for "longdesc".          CMN: I have a long and complex argument against this proposal.         GR: I have a simple one: primary content is in the mind of the       beholder.         /* The Chair moves this discussion to the mailing list. */         /* EH leaves */        2.Proposed changes to audio volume control checkpoints         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0004.html         Resolved: proposal accepted.       Action IJ: Implement this proposal.        3.Minimum list of single command functionalities for checkpoint 10.5         JRG:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0037.html        KB:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0433.html          HB: I don't like all the implications of the list.          Who hesitates to create an explicit list of functionalities:        CMN, KB, IJ, DB, HB, GR.          DP: I like the list, but it shouldn't be the *only* list.          HB: Some of the proposed functionalities have limited domain        (e.g., font size).          KB: When I was first trying to come up with this list, I        wondered whether "search" was critical, since you need to        do this by entering text.          JG: Note clearly that this is single-key (in the case of a  keyboard).        Not modifiers.          Resolved: Unless someone sends a new proposal that we accept,        then this list is ok.              5.Minimum requirement for checkpoint 7.5 on searching:         case-sensitive forward.          IJ: I think that forward is P1. Anything else is convenient.                GR: You search from an arbitrary point, you don't know where you        are.             HB: When you find content, you need to figure out your context.          IJ: We assume that you need to be able to search from the        beginning. You need to be able to continue from where you are.         Resolved:         - You need to be able to start a forward search from a location           in content selected or focused by the user.            [The default starting point is the beginning of content.]         - When a match occurs, you need to be able to            continue searching forward from that location in content.         - Case-insensitive search option (when applicable to            the text language).         - Include in techniques context information (e.g., 3rd match,           bottom of document reached).               GR: Is search necessarily on a per-viewport basis?          IJ: Both functionalities are useful: search on a set of           documents, search on this document only.         GR: What about framesets?         JG: I think that it would be useful to be able to search           on all frames in a frameset, but that we shouldn't           be that specific in the guidelines.         Action IJ: Add search options to techniques document about       searching on framesets.        6.Minimum requirement for Checkpoints 2.7: For author-identified but         unsupported natural languages, allow the user to configure the         user agent to identify those language changes in content.  [Priority 3]         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html         IJ: I retract the proposal. I don't want to say "in content". I  think       that style and the DOM in tandem would allow people to know.         IJ: Also, I think that "notification" is the wrong idea.        I think identification is necessary. Prompts are not.         DP: I agree, I don't think that the user should be interrupted.         /* Rich joins */        Action IJ: Repropose checkpoint 2.7.        7.Minimum requirement for Checkpoints 6.1: 6.1 Implement the      accessibility features of all supported specifications (markup  languages,      style sheet languages,        metadata languages, graphics formats, etc.). [Priority 1]         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html        IJ: In short - implement the features related to the requirements      of the WAI guidelines.        CMN: Re circularity; I have concerns about how far "applicability"      goes.        /* IJ notes that IETF drafts have "security issues" sections,         which allows people to know what security issues are raised by         a spec. We don't have the same thing for accessibility. */        IJ: Basically, I want people to:         - Look at specs for identified accessibility features.         - Look at WAI guidelines to find out accessibility           requirements.         - Look at system level accessibility requirements.         - That's all you're required to do.       CMN: The process I have in mind is this:        - You're building a VRML browser. You go to the VRML spec          and implement what it requires.        - Then you go to WCAG 1.0 and see what features in VRML let          you do this.         - I'm not so sure about system-level requirements.          GR: Those are required by ATAG and UAAG.          (You don't need to do anything in addition to meeting ATAG           and UAAG.)       Resolved:      The set of things to implement is :          - Those things labeled in the spec as such.          - Those things in the specification which support            WAI Guidelines requirements.        8.Minimum requirement for Checkpoints 8.1: 8.1 Make available to the       user the author-specified purpose of each table and the      relationships among the table cells and headers. [Priority 1]         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html        IJ: Do we need to say more than "support what the spec says"?       In my discussion with Tantek yesterday, we talked about UA  requirements       to conform to specification but also to *not conform* by       performing repair functionalities. I'll raise this issue on the       list.         /* DB leaves */        IJ: I am proposing to leave the checkpoint as is and adding      as a note that information that relies on spatial relationships      in a two-d environment must translate those relationships      if rendering serially. And leave this as a note as well:      "For graphical user agents, it is sufficient        to render a table as a two-dimensional grid with header       information, and to make available all content per checkpoint       2.1."         GR: This assumes that you can view header and cell information       together on the same screen (size of table, screen magnification,        etc.)         KB: I have concerns similar to GR. The spatial is only       meaningful if you can get at the information needed.         IJ: There may be some rendering situations when you simply       can't render cells and header cells at the same time.         HB: You could enable scrolling.         HB: A concern that I have: most markup used today does not       use the features available in HTML.         JG: I think we may need a query interface.         /* We don't have any other query requirements, only "make          available" */           IJ:        - I think we might want to point out danger cases instead          of establishing minimal requirements, and possible techniques:          a) MQ: For large tables, or large text, need to ensure             that relationships are available, e.g., through a query             interface. Refer to structured navigation, which could             be used in conjunction with a query mechanism.          b) For many cases, fixed headers and footers will suffice             (i.e., rendering alone will suffice). Heads up on serial             rendering.         Resolved: In 8.1, change "relationships" to       "author-specified relationships". No change to        make a minimal requirement.         Action IJ: Make rendering v. query clearer in the note after       the checkpoint.             Action HB: Propose a finite set of information about tables       calculated by the user agent based on author-specified       markup that might be incorporated as a minimal requirement for       checkpoint 8.1.        9.Minimum requirement for Checkpoints 8.2 and 8.3: Distinguishing         link checkpoints.          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html       12.Minimum requirement for checkpoint 4.13: Allow the user to  configure   how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background  color).   [Priority 1]         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0036.html       13.Minimum requirement for checkpoint 4.14: Allow the user to  configure   how the content focus is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background   color). [Priority        1]         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0035.html       IJ: I propose for 8.2, 8.3, 4.13, and 4.14 one mechanism beyond         color. Note that this is for the UA's user interface, the          information must also be available through an API.        GR: I would also add - don't rely on font characteristics alone as         well.       IJ: If you your solution uses fonts, you need to make sure that         the user can control font family and font size.       Action IJ: Propose change for these four checkpoints that basically     says:        - At least one mechanism other than color.        - Any mechanism used must meet the accessibility requirements          of this document (e.g., related to color selection, font          size or family selection, etc.).    Open Action Items        1.IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers.         (No deadline.)    Completed Action Items        2.JG: Check on availability of telephone bridge for starting telecon         one half hour earlier.            Results: We will have two-hour teleconferences starting today.       3.GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and see whether they can       be clarified to account for control of rendering of audio (and  possibly       other content) on load.

      Hello,    Checkpoints 10.8 and 2.3 as listed in "Determining Conformance to the   User Agent Guidelines 1.0" [1] are the following:       Checkpoint 10.8  Ensure that frequently used functionalities                       are easily activated in the default input                      configuration.        Checkpoint 2.3  If content available in a viewport has equivalent                      alternatives, provide easy access in context to                      the alternatives.       1) For 10.8, I propose that the minimal requirement is for     one-stroke activation in the default input configuration.     I propose that the set of frequently used functions be      whatever the minimal requirement for checkpoint 10.5 turns      out to be.  Refer to Kitch's proposal [2].    2) For checkpoint 2.3, Jon has already proposed [3] (I'm paraphrasing):     that the UA can either render primary and alternative content  together     or the alternative in place of the primary.       I think that there are other solutions that would also satisfy the     easy access requirement, such as these:         - Provide a link to the alternative content, readily available         inline.         - Allow the user to query the primary content for alternatives         in the user interface (e.g,. through a context menu). For this         to work, you would need to be able to select the primary content         and then query the UA for alternatives, and of course the  selection         must be accessible, etc.         - Allow the user to toggle a switch globally so that all          alternatives are rended inline.         - Allow the user to toggle a switch globally so that a link is         available for each alternative (inline).       I also think that "configuration" and "control" are both important     in this context: I may want to tell the UA one time "Always give me     text equivalents". I may also want to query objects one at a time for     their equivalents.       Jon refers to an exception case: "multi-media checkpoints that      require the option for simultaneous rendering of primary and      alternative equivalent content." (Checkpoint 2.4).        Some comments:       1) I'm nervous about telling user agents how to design their        user interface, except where we have clear requirements (such        as implementing a focus).        2) A given piece of content may have several alternatives. Consider        IMG in HTML, which has both "alt" and "longdesc". The HTML spec        doesn't say how longdesc has to be rendered.       3) What about something like this:           Provide single-stroke access to equivalents, either by         allowing the user to turn on and off rendering of equivalents         or by providing direct access (e.g., via a link or context         menu) to equivalents rendered in a separate viewport.           Notes:         a) What about control v. configure?         b) "Turning on and off rendering of equivalents" doesn't say            whether primary content is to be rendered at the same time            or not. This eliminates the need for Jon's exception case.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0525.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0394.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

[Priority 1]   > </BLOCKQUOTE>    Working group comments to my previous proposal suggest that we  need to reach a common understanding of the purpose of this   checkpoint before a rewrite will help. Here are pieces of  my understanding of the requirement intended for 1.5:    1) We are expressing a user-interface requirement, not a programmatic     access requirement. Checkpoint 5.2 already requires programmatic     access to user interface controls.    2) I don't think 1.5 is meant to require a text equivalent for each     message to the user. I think that text is a useful technique that     enables different output modalities. Note that programmatic access      to UI controls is covered by checkpoint 5.2    3) I don't think that the requirement is for a user agent to provide     a user interface controls, say, both graphically and through audio     (but not speech if speech is not supported).    So what is this requirement supposed to say? A previous incarnation  of the checkpoint (from the Last Call draft  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/) suggests that  it's really about messages through the UI:    <LAST CALL>        1.5 Ensure that all messages to the user (e.g., informational         messages, warnings, errors, etc.) are available through all output         device APIs used by the user agent.  </LAST CALL>    How about this:    <NEW PROPOSAL>        1.5 Ensure that user agent-initiated messages to the user            (e.g., informational messages, warnings, error messages, etc.)            are available through all output channels supported by the user            interface.  </NEW PROPOSAL>    Notes:   0) I'd rather not talk about output device API.   1) Applicability still applies here.    2) I've limited the scope slightly (perhaps uselessly) to those      messages initiated by the user agent. I'm not particularly wedded      to that bit of the proposal.   3) The note afterwards would be the same as the one below in the      OLD PROPOSAL.     - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#195  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128    <OLD PROPOSAL>     > Therefore I propose this clarification:  >   > <BLOCKQUOTE>  >   1.5 Ensure that the user interface presents information through  >       more than one output mechanism.  >   >   (Note afterwards):  >       For example, alert the user to an event with a graphical  >       cue, and an audio cue, and a text message on the status bar.  >       Refer also to checkpoint 5.4.  > </BLOCKQUOTE>  >   > Also, we can add to the techniques document that the user may want  > to configure the output modes.    </OLD PROPOSAL>    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The issue was raised, even in Proposed Recommendation,  whether adoption of operating system features by the user agent would  allow for conformance. This is captured in the definition of  native support. Two changes would be necessary to get rid of the  definition:    1) Move the part about adoption of OS features to the section on  conformance.  2) Change the conformance provisions (as described by Charles [1]) to     allow conformance with the proper scoping (this piece of software  version     2 with that piece of software version 3).     For a long time, we have avoided conformance provisions that would  create  dependencies between vendors. I think, however, that I agree with  Charles  that it would be fine to allow conformance claims that involved several  pieces of software as long as the combination was identified in the  claim.  I want to avoid requiring conformance by software in tandem, but I don't  see any reason to prevent conformance by software in tandem. A claim is  a claim.      - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0223.html    P.S. For some reason, I think I used to want to prevent this situation  of allowing conformance by software in tandem, but this morning I can't  remember why! I looked back at the summary of conformance issues [2] and  couldn't find any evidence.

I have two comments:    1) I think Eric's proposal is a clarification of the current  implications     of checkpoint 11.1. Therefore, I think it can be incorporated as     an editorial change.    2) I think Charles' comment raises a new issue for this checkpoint.     We have had two previous issues about relative priority      checkpoints (Issue 267 [1] for checkpoint 11.2 and Issue 111 [2]     for checkpoint 6.1).        In both of those cases, we did not choose a relative priority     scheme and both checkpoints remained P1. For checkpoint 6.1,     it was felt that authors would never use P3 features unless     UAs supported them. And for checkpoint 11.2, it was felt that     knowing about UA features that promote accessibility     (whatever their priority) was critical to using the tool.         Checkpoint 11.1 is slightly different; it's about the     documentation itself, not features being supported or     documented.        I understand Charles' point, and I could live with a relative     priority checkpoint here. However, I would prefer just leaving     it a Level-A requirement and keeping the document simpler.     I would not be in favor of choosing Level Double-A just because     it's in the middle.     - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#267  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111     > Charles  >   > On Thu, 17 Aug 2000, Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   >   Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   >  >   > "Hansen, Eric" wrote:  >   >   > > New:  >   > >  >   > > "11.1 Provide a version of the product documentation that conforms to  >   > > level-A of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10].

There are a number of checkpoints, in fact, where      finding the answer requires intimate knowledge of the          software's specs. That's an issue I'd like to discuss       elsewhere. However, to answer this specific question,       in my opinion, the developer      must make claims (somewhere) about what APIs are supported.

IJ: So should all UAs be required to support all input-device       APIs available for the operating system?       I don't think so, even  though we hope that mainstream              browsers support at least mouse      and keyboard APIs. That's why I think in the end it's not      the available APIs that matters, but the available APIs that      the software developers claim to support.    > >PROPOSAL 2) Checkpoint 3.2.

IJ: I don't understand "staying within". The problem is that      navigation and access are intimately linked here. Navigation      is just a technique for more efficient access to cell content     (just as tabbing navigation provides efficient access to links      and form controls). One day I want to delete this checkpoint      and make it a technique, another I think it's important as      a checkpoint in its own right. Can we shorten to "Allow the      user to navigate the cells of a table" along with the good      examples you provide below?     > For example, keyboard navigation from cell to cell  > might be accomplished using the using the arrow keys  > where as voice navigation from cell to cell might be  > with voice commands like up, down, right, and left.

The WG discussed what type of support for RDF and metadata  in general UAs should provide. This was considered  due to checkpoint 13.2 of WCAG:        "Provide metadata to add semantic information      to pages and sites."    The result of discussions was: implement the spec. We couldn't  come up with any Guidelines-level requirements since metadata  could be used for everything.     For discussions, refer to issue #72 [2] and the 15 September  resolution (from minutes [3]):          Resolved: Include as techniques.    Marja, Jim Allan, Charles, and myself were asked to provide  links to sources of metadata in various specs (HTML, SMIL,  CSS, Schemas). Links to those resolutions are in [3].    Refer also to minutes of 9 September GL meeting [4] where  we said about metadata:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  9. CMN will take the issue regarding meta data to PF    (see list of potential strategies).

      Hello,    Per my action from the 16 November face-to-face meeting [1],  please consider this proposed change to checkpoint 6.2.    From the 23 October draft [2]:      6.2 Use and conform to W3C Recommendations when they are         available and appropriate for a task. [Priority 2]           Note: For instance, for markup, conform to HTML 4 [HTML4], XHTML        1.0 [XHTML10], or XML 1.0 [XML]. For style sheets, conform to        CSS ([CSS1], [CSS2]). For mathematics, conform to MathML        [MATHML]. For synchronized multimedia, implement SMIL 1.0        [SMIL]. For information about programmatic access to HTML and        XML content, refer to guideline 5. User agents may conform to        other specifications in addition to those required by this        checkpoint. For reasons of backward compatibility, user agents        should continue to implement deprecated features of        specifications. Information about deprecated language features        is generally part of the language's specification.    The discussion points at the face-to-face meeting were  the following:    1) It's a P2 issue to implement W3C specifications, or if     you don't, implement formats that allow conformance to     WCAG 1.0 (at any level of conformance).    2) It's a P2 issue to conform to a spec, not just     to implement it incompletely.    3) It's important to support deprecated features, but     this will not a requirement of UAAG 1.0 (per our resolution).    4) It's important to implement the latest version,     but developers should consider supporting the version that     has the latest accessibility features. [This is for Techniques]    5) One reviewer requested a clearer statement of     what "available" means.    Putting these together:    <NEW>    6.2 Use and conform to either (1) W3C Recommendations when they are         available and appropriate for a task, or (2) non-W3C         specifications that enable the creation of content that        conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0        [WCAG10] at any conformance level. [Priority 2]           Note: For instance, for markup, conform to HTML 4 [HTML4], XHTML        1.0 [XHTML10], or XML 1.0 [XML]. For style sheets, conform to        CSS ([CSS1], [CSS2]). For mathematics, conform to MathML        [MATHML]. For synchronized multimedia, implement SMIL 1.0        [SMIL]. A specification is considered "available" if it is        published (e.g., as a W3C Recommendation) in time for        integration into a user agent's development cycle.  </NEW>    For the techniques (in addition to other points):    1) For reasons of backward compatibility, user agents should continue  to implement deprecated features of specifications. Information about  deprecated language features is generally part of the language's  specification.    2) If more than one version or level of a specification is appropriate  for a particular task, user agents are encouraged to conform to the  latest version. However, developers should consider implementing the  version that best supports accessibility, even if this is not the  latest version.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-324  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The "provide" in the checkpoint below is  meant for the user agent, and the UA will usually (always?)  derive navigation mechanisms from markup: LINK elements, header elements  used to contstruct a table of contents, etc.    Furthermore, the requirement for metadata from authors is   checkpint 13.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines   (under Guideline 13) [1]:         13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and  sites.    The UA Working Group has discussed how to support metadata provided  by authors and decided that user agents should   handle metadata according to specification.

The intention is to allow the user to select content (e.g.,  structured by element or text content that may span element  boundaries) and have it rendered as speech or braille.   UAs should also allow users to select content and find  out contextual information about it (e.g., row/colum  coordinates of a table cell).    > And didn't find help in the techniques  > document.     Alas, the techniques document has been slow to catch  up to the guidelines.

I think  that the user should be able to select any rendered text content.  I believe that the user should be able to select any non-text  content as well, but there are undoubtedly implications to  be considered for graphics, etc.    > If none  > can be selected, is 7.2 vacuously satisfied?    Probably, we should clarify that this refers to content  rendered natively (i.e., not by a plug-in, etc.).     Please let me know if this clarifies the checkpoint. If  not, or if you think there are issues, please let me know.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

Of course, that doesn't mean Lynx isn't  useful, and it may even be very accessible when used in  conjunction with assistive technology. Here's our disclaimer  from section 3:      "Note: Conformance to the requirements of this document is      expected to be a strong  indicator of accessibility, but it is      neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for ensuring the      accessibility of software. Some software may not conform to this      document but still be accessible to some users with disabilities.     Conversely, software may conform to this document but still be     inaccessible to some users with disabilities."    I am pretty sure that people probably agree that Lynx should  be praised as a tool that makes content accessible to many people.  However, shouldn't Lynx implement the accessibility features  of HTML like other browsers? As for the DOM requirements, the  WG has reinforced their presence in the document several occasions.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/#Conformance    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The HTML 4.0 specification says that when a label receives  focus, it passes it on to the explicitly associated control. Thus,  I don't see the need to search on attribute values of LABEL here.  I do see the need to be able to search on the content of LABEL  in this case.     - Ian

GR: not available    5.Issue #321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of checkpoint  2.3         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0085.html    /* AG joins, CMN joins */    IJ: The problem is in the definition of equivalent. It has      implications related to accessibility. The real issue, I believe,      is not about 2.3 but the definition of equivalent. We proposed      "alternative" because it includes "equivalent" and doesn't have      implications about disabilities.      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0157.html    AG: You may have meant that, but you didn't write that.       Definition of equivalent is broken and needs to be fixed.      I don't think we can close this today.    /* AG has to leave */    EH: A couple of pieces from WCAG that I tried to use are to:   - Have a dfn of equivalency that makes UAAG 1.0 consistent with     WCAG 1.0. Also, language from the WCAG definition of equivalency:     Refer to WCAG:      "In the context of this document, the equivalent must       fulfill essentially the same function for the person       with a disability (at least insofar as is feasible,       given the nature of the disability and the state of      technology), as the primary content does for the person       without any disability."     http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#glossary       If you drift too much from this definition, you break the     relationship between UAAG 1.0 and WCAG 1.0 and possibly to     things out of scope for UAAG 1.0.    JG: I think we need to focus on the disability part, not the      more general scope required by "alternative" (e.g,. in      other languages).    IJ: So implications of changing definition of equivalent:      - Relationship to WCAG 1.0 needs examining.      - Relationship to other terms may be broken.    EH: On the "mathematical" interpretation of equality: It's  still applicable here. You can refer to an elephant and  a horse as having an equivalency relationship if you limit  the scope of the attributes to being, e.g., they are mammals.    JG: Our main issue is that there has to be recognized  markup for the UA to be responsible for handling the  equivalents.    CMN: I don't think that it's necessary to restrict   what we call "equivalency relationships" to those that  are for people with disabilities.    IJ: Are you arguing that our requirements should be  larger?    CMN: No. But I still think that the definition is too narrow.    IJ: Why increase the definition if there are no requirements  that benefit?    CMN: Missing a reference group: users of large print.    IJ: Yes, that is true: as defined in this document, equivalency  does not include a reference group requiring large print.  Let's expand the list of reference disability groups rather than  eliminating our assumptions.    EH: We need to think carefully about adding/substracing reference  groups because this is the definition that affects the scope of  WCAG 1.0, checkpoint 1.1. Note that the current definition is  only about pre-rendered content, not rendered content.    CMN: In principle, I agree. We are about ensuring access to  content for users with disabilities. In practice, I think that  our method of defining things is :    a) Deficient in current document.  b) Likely to be deficient if we attempt to define by list.    CMN: Proposed definition of equivalency:     - Delete equivalency target.    - Change "two pieces" to "two or more pieces".      IJ: It's easier to write binary relationships.      CMN: But I think it's harder to talk about equivalents           composed of several pieces.      IJ: That can be covered by saying that an equivalent may          be composed of several pieces.    IJ: There is no "direction" in the definition of equivalent. Where's  the direction?    CMN: Part of my problem is that that definition makes an  assumption about authoring...    IJ: No it doesn't. Text equivalent says nothing about author  intent, only about renderability and potential accessibility.    EH: Here's an example that touches on the issue of directionality.  A  sense in which content is bi-polar: there is a person with a  disability at one end, and a person without a disability at the other.    /* Eric gives example with different types of equivalency    relationships. In one, the text is the equivalency target    and a picture is an equivalent, e.g., deaf non-reader.    In another example, the picture is the equivalency target    and the text is the equivalent. But in the first case,    the "picture equivalent" is not a text equivalent. But there    is only a P3 WCAG 1.0 requirement for this.      Note: there's no reason why we call one the target and one    the equivalent. It makes more sense as written because of     how wcag 1.0 is written.  */    CMN: In markup, you sometimes have things that are explicitly  equivalents of one another (e.g., IMG and "alt" in HTML). In SMIL,  the equivalency relationship is not directly defined. It could be  inferred in a number of cases. The equivalency relationships are  not specified by the author. Can you capture the situation where  it's unambiguous which is the equivalent and which is the  equivalency target?    IJ: Is an equivalent assumed to be accessible to a user  without a disability?    EH: No such claim.    JG: Listening to this, I think that the definition of equivalent needs  to be bound to a disability need. Also, there doesn't seem to be a  compelling argument about using equivalent/equivalency target.    JG: To move forward, I think we may want to incrementally  add to what WCAG says and then let WAI solve the problem outside  of the UAWG. I think we should not try to have a definition of  equivalent that differs substantially from the WCAG 1.0 definition.  Having a broader definition is an issue for the WAI CG.  I don't think that we should change the definition on our  own.    IJ: Is the issue closed? Will the WG entertain a   proposed definition?    CMN: I'm in an interesting position. I'm a sometime  participant and also responsible for reviewing the document  for WAI PF and WAI ATAG. As a comment from PF, I would propose  to change the definition. I think this is an editorial point,  however.    CMN: My meta-comment from PF: Groups say "we don't want to change"  all the time. If no WG wants to take the lead, nothing will change.    Action CMN: Propose a change to the definition for in one week.    6.Issue #322: The definition of the word element  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0131.html    Closed Action items        1.DP: Review checkpoints in Guideline 1 for implementation  information         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0205.html        6.JA: Review checkpoints in Guideline 4 for implementation  information        7.JG: Review checkpoints in Guideline 2 for implementation  information         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0200.html        9.EH and IJ: Propose new language for checkpoint 2.3        Guideline 7:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0152.html        Guideline 5:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0146.html        8.JG: Send information to CG on interested people to work on  glossary             (Eric, Harvey, Ian)    Open Action Items        2.GR: Contacts for Dolphin for reviewing WCAG        3.GR: Review checkpoints in Guideline 10 for implementation  information        4.MQ: Review speech checkpoints for implementation information      In progress.        5.KB: Submit technique on providing information on current item and             number of items in search          --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,     In the 27 August draft [1], applicable checkpoint is defined  as follows:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  A checkpoint applies to a user agent unless:                 a          * The checkpoint definition states explicitly that          it only applies to a different class of user agent.          * The checkpoint addresses a content type (script,          image, video, sound, applets, etc.)         that the user agent does not recognize.          * The checkpoint refers to a content type that the user          agent recognizes but does not support natively.          * The checkpoint refers to the properties of an         embedded object (e.g., video or animation rate)          that may not be controlled or accessed by the user agent.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    I would like to change this definition as follows:      The spirit of these guidelines is the following:    If a user agent offers a functionality, it must     ensure that all users have access to that     functionality or an equivalent alternative. Thus,    if the user agent supports keyboard input, it must     support accessible keyboard input. If the user    agent supports images, it must ensure access to each image    or an alternative equivalent supplied by the author.    If a user agent supports style sheets, it must     implement the accessibility features of the style    sheet language. If the user agent supports    frames, it must ensure access to frame     alternatives supplied by the author.      Not all user agents support every content    type, markup language feature, input or output    device interface, etc. When a content type, feature, or    device interface is not supported, checkpoints with requirements    related to it do not apply to the user agent. Thus,    if a user agent supports style sheets at all,    all checkpoints related to style sheet accessibility apply.     If a user agent does not support style sheets at all,    the checkpoints do not apply.       The applicability of checkpoints related to     markup language features is measured    similarly. If a user agent supports tables, it must    support the accessibility features of the language    related to tables (or images, or frames, or video, or    links, etc.). The Techniques Document includes information    about the accessibility features of W3C languages such as HTML,    CSS, and SMIL.      The following summarizes criteria for applicability.    A checkpoint applies to a user agent unless:         * The checkpoint definition states explicitly that          it only applies to a different class of user agent.          * The checkpoint includes requirements about          a content type (script, image, video, sound,          applets, etc.) that the user agent does not          recognize at all.         * The checkpoint includes requirements about          a content type that the user          agent recognizes but does not support natively.         * The checkpoint refers to the properties of an         embedded object (e.g., video or animation rate)          that may not be controlled or accessed by the user agent.          * The checkpoint includes requirements about an         unsupported markup language or other technology        (e.g., style sheets,  mathematical markup language,         synchronized multimedia, metadata description language, etc.)            * The checkpoint refers to an unsupported         input or output device interface.

FTF meeting information        JB: We need to finalize the meeting in the next few days. Also,         people need to reconfirm their availability for the dates in         question: 10-11 April.        JG: We need at least four teleconfs to settle outstanding issues.       JG and IJ will follow up with Judy.          2. Additional telecons scheduled for 23 February and 1 March (2pm ET)      2) Discussion        1.Update on current state of the UA guidelines and       W3C process overview.            JG provides process background.       2.Using DOM to access WWW content             JG: At ftf in December, we decided to rely on DOM for              access to content.              http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991209             JG: Why the DOM?              - Standard access to structure.               - Don't recreate relationships based on graphical rendering.            JG: Useful to WG to know some of the reasons why some              organizations are already using a DOM or the W3C DOM.            CL: We're using the IE DOM. One main reason is that in HP 5,              we interpreted HTML, but couldn't handle Java. We're              waiting for Mozilla.             RS: One reason we're interested in the DOM is to be able              to monitor changes to documents.             KH (IBM): We are developing on top of IE as our first target. We  would then build on whatever IE starts. As a developer working on the  project, coming up to speed involves how the IE DOM maps to the W3C  DOM. We haven't done much with events yet, but will probably have to.  Imagine a scenario where a low-vision user and a sighted user are  collaborating. We need information about mouse events in our rendering   agent. E.g., changes to focus. Also, RS and I were discussing  yesterday about notification to our browser about changes to the DOM.            HB: How are changes to the DOM propagated to other user              agents?            JG: Sychronization has been a topic that the WG considers              needs to be addressed (in a timely fashion).            KH: I think it's important to have notification that some               piece of the DOM has changed.             PLH: What DOM are we talking about?                   JG: Most of the developers here are probably familiar with the               IE DOM.           PLH: The IE DOM includes all of W3C DOM Level 1 and some of DOM               level 2.            JG: I proposed last week that we limit read access to DOM              Level 1. And some other parts of DOM Level 1 for writing.              This is on the agenda for next week's meeting.            GG: It's hard to get useful events from IE's implementation              of the DOM. You don't know which elements may be changed               through external scripts. We track other events (document              load, window open, etc.)             RS: One problem is that IE's DOM is inbetween DOM 1 and DOM 2.              Glen's issue "Where do I attach my event handlers?" is one              we're dealing with in the DOM WG.             SS: CAST's E-reader is not really a screen-reader since it  doesn't target blind users. More for users with learning  disabilities. The graphical rendering is critical. Also  text-to-speech. We host the IE component in our shell for the browser  functionality. Our developers are currently working with Form  elements. Those are the events where we would want event  notification. I haven't run into any serious problems yet with the IE  DOM. At this time, information about loading, or window spawning, is  available to us. Some of our limitations are due to the limitations of   the IE component.           DG: With Windowize, we get most information through MSAA. But  that doesn't give us everything that we need.           JE: We don't have any experience with the DOM. We rely on MSAA  and an offscreen model. DOM looks like it has a lot of potential. I'd  be interested in knowing what applications support DOM.           PLH: IE5 supports DOM level 1 and part of DOM level 2. Netscape  is not DOM Level 1, but Mozilla will be completely DOM Level 1  enabled. Operasoft intends to support DOM 1/2.            JG: I don't know about multimedia players.          PLH: IE 5 plans to support the SMIL DOM. Also, RealNetworks  plans to support the SMIL DOM.           JG: Is DOM compelling for the Mac environment where there is  isn't MSAA?           HR: Yes. DOM will be very useful, also for XML applications.    /*  2.Interfaces to the DOM */           JG: Note that IE uses the COM model to allow assistive  technologies to access the DOM.            PLH: But COM is a DOM-binding. The DOM spec provides              three bindings: ECMA-script, IDL (Corba), Java.            RS: For DOM 3, we want to require that binding names map  specifically to names in the DOM. This will save effort for assistive  technologies. E.g., the IE DOM API name doesn't match the W3C DOM  name.    /*  3.Read only versus read/write access  */           JG: One developer suggested that read access was the primary  requirement for ATs, and write access was only important for things  like form controls, or other elements that can be modified through the   user interface. Would this satisfy AT demands?            SS: I think that as a first pass, read access is more  important.             IJ: One way to formulate the propoposal was that you have to  be able to do through the programmatic interface what you can do  through the UI.            RS: You may want to insert bookmarks on the fly. You may also  want to impose style changes.            KH: We need to be able to manipulate the input elements. We  might also want to highlight elements dynamically (e.g., bouncing ball   effect). We might have to manipulate some style properties.            PLH: There is a range interface in DOM Level 2.            RS: There isn't a selection model in DOM Level 2.            DA: Are bookmarks persistent?                   RS: Current examples are not.            DG: At some point I'd like to allow the user to fill out  forms.                MQ: Jaws for Windows modifies the view sent to the user. They  put table row and column information in the document tree.     /*  4.Checkpoint 5.5 Ensure that programmatic exchanges proceed in a            timely manner. [Priority 2]  */           RS: We did some initial testing about accessing the DOM  out-of-process (e.g., in Windows, through the COM module). It was 12  times faster in process. Currently, in-process not possible unless you   embed the browser in your application. We have been struggling with  the issue of how to define "timely".           DG: The DOM in IE may be responsive, but the COM has a  tremendous amount of overhead.            RS: That's right. We'd like to have a technique for getting at  the DOM in process. How to we clarify what "timely" means at the  checkpoint level? A scenario where it becomes a problem: sizeable  document, listening for changes. In this case, the performance  degrades exponentially. Glen Gordon complained that the performance  hit caused lots of problems. So the question is: how do you specify  the "timely" requirement?           DB: We've been trying to get Rob Sinclair and Rob Rylea  involved. I can't offer much at this point.           RS: One suggestion: "Provide access to elements in-process."           IJ: That sounds like a huge implementation requirement.           RS: I don't think so. All systems have the notion of a  registry. It would be possible for user agents to launch assistive  technologies and communicate with them in-process. For AT vendors, it  means being able to handle caching operations and being able to talk  with the "mother" user agent. Take the Java example: a Java process  can load an assitive technology. Very very fast.                   HR: Often, in timing, there is information in events. "Timely"  means that the information in the events must be available on  different timing scales.            IJ: So you have to be able to preserve information across  different scales.           SS: Does this mean that timing issues are negligible when the  AT is in-process?           RS: Accesses in-process were on the order of tenths of  nanoseconds. COM is smart, so in-process, doesn't do mappings that  take time.           DG: I think that performance is critical to being able to use  the DOM.            SS: Does timing mean more than no loss of information? Does it  include an upper limit.           IJ: I would object to timing requirements. Also, it sounds good   to say "timely means that information conveyed by events is available  to assistive technologies" but, how to know how to verify this?          HR: A second timing issue - responsiveness of the system to user   interaction. Ten seconds is too long. Then this becomes a performance  issue. But I don't have a way to address this.          PLH: I don't think that it makes sense to impose timing  requirements on user agents.           DA: So talk in absolute time, but in terms of  overhead. E.g. "1.5 times as fast".            JG: I don't think we can do this.           RS: What we are trying to do is create an "engine extension". ..           JG: I hear developers saying this is an important issue.                      IJ: I really don't see how we can talk about performance  requirements, even though I realize that the user's experience is  important. What is the functional requirement?           JG: I want to continue the timing issue on the list.      ---  JG: What resources would be useful for people? The survey showed these   requests:       3.Resources needed to help AT developers use the DOM in their  products           1.Example code           2.On-line resources           4.Access to experts           5.Other types of resources     JG: People did not seem to consider a workshop crucial.     DG: I also wanted well-written documentation. When experts aren't  available.    SS: I think that demo code is critical. Also interaction with  experts is critical. Also other developers with experience.  I don't know how you intend to implement available experts. I'd  suggest making this specific.     JG: I can't guarantee these resources. I want to take information back   to the WAI on what developers want.     KH: I think that the above order is a good one.     HR: A reference implementation of the DOM would be helpful. Without a  large mother application.    PLH: I know there's a generic DOM module developed by IBM, called, I  think "Weblet". The goal is to build the Java DOM for the browser. It  runs with IE, and the developer is working on the Netscape version.    Action PLH: Send URI to this work to the UA WG mailing list.      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't think it's a question of "justifiable". Exemptions  are possible through our various mechanisms: applicability,  conformance levels, content type labels, and input modalities.  That's what I intended by "exemption".     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    The AU Guidlines 1.0 Recommendation [1] includes the following Note  about conformance:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Note: Authoring tools that conform to this document will propagate  accessible   Web content and be useful to anyone regardless of disability. There will  also   be authoring tools that produce accessible content in favorable  circumstances  (e.g., a text editor used by a motivated author), or provide an   accessible interface to authors with certain disabilities, but  that do not conform to these guidelines.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    As part of our efforts to clarify the intended user agent  audience for these guidelines, I propose adding some similar text,  such as:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  These guidelines are designed so that conforming user agents,  when used in conjunction with assistive technology, are accessible  to most users with disabilities. Some user agents may not conform  to these guidelines but still be accessible to some users with   disabilities. This document should help developers of all user  agents improve the accessibility of their products.  </BLOCKQUOTE>     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10/#Introduction  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I've published the 31 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and  Techniques [2]. It is my strong hope and expectation that these  documents will be the ones that go to last call (possibly with minor  editorial changes and additional techniques). These documents  incorporate all the resolutions to all the second last call issues.    If you have substantial comments, please hold them until last call.  If you have editorial suggestions, you may send them and I'll try to  incorporate them before last call, but may wait until last call.    The changes in this version [3] are on the Web and quoted below as  text.  Noteworthy changes are:     - New checkpoint 3.8 about toggling placeholders.   - Checkpoints 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.7 now require     a publicly documented API if a standard one doesn't exist.   - Checkpoint 11.4: Minimal requirement for single-key bindings     now the set of functionalities in 11.5. Also improved Note     after checkpoint.   - Executive summary now integrated as an appendix.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010331/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010331/  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html#WD-UAAG10-20010331    -------  CHANGES  -------    General     * Integrated executive summary per [54]29 March 2001 teleconference.   * Further deleted instances of "must" to fall in line with RFC2119.     "Must" only used in checkpoints, in references to checkpoints that     use "must", and in section on conformance.    Guidelines     * Added Note before Guideline one about checkpoint     "interdependence".    Checkpoints     * 1.2: This checkpoint moved from Guideline 9 per [55]29 March 2001     teleconference since about device-independence.   * 2.3: Clarified (with one word) in checkpoint what was already in     the Note: that the config requirement is global.   * 2.5, 2.6: Added that these are special cases of 2.1.   * 2.7: Editorial changes to remove "author's intention" and instead     focus on how the content is encoded. Same language as 2.6 in     essence.   * 3.2, 3.7: Per comments from Greg Lowney, changed to not talk about     activation of placeholders (but same requirement).   * 3.4, 4.16: Added some rationale to Notes about turning off     scripts/style sheets as a last resort technique.   * 3.8: New. Added per decision at [56]29 March 2001 teleconference.     See [57]issue 467.   * 4.6: Changed "same" to "at least" for clarity, per decision at     [58]29 March 2001 teleconference.   * 4.11 (and elsewhere): Changed "speech playback rate" to "speech     rate".   * 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7: Important Per decision at [59]29 March 2001     teleconference, added requirements that if standard APIs not     available, use some publicly documented API to provide access.   * 8.2: Tweaks in Note about conformance to W3C specs.   * 9.2: Per decision at [60]29 March 2001 teleconference, did not add     requirement for reverse navigation, but did add suggestion to     note.   * 9.4: Per decision at [61]29 March 2001 teleconference, changed     language from "query" to allow for non-query techniques.   * 10.2, 10.6: Fixed label: These checkpoints are for content only.     Moved 10.6 to section on content requirements.   * 11.4: Minimal requirement is to have single key bindings for at     least all of what's in 11.5, per decision at [62]29 March 2001     teleconference. Add a Note to encourage developers to supply a     bunch of single key bindings AND that most functionalities should     be available for single-key bindings. Other edits as well to     clarify the meaning of single key, option for modifiers for     default input config. See [63]issue 468.    Conformance     * In applicability provision 3, cleaned up references to event     handlers.   * Added (new) checkpoint 3.8 to content type label groups Video,     Audio, Animation, and Image.   * Added note that checkpoint grouping/order has no bearing on     conformance.   * Added note that link to techniques after checkpoint is     informative.    Glossary     * Some general (minor) editorial cleanup.   * "Placeholder": updates and cleanup of definition. Added some     techniques as well to convey idea.   * Updated definition of "Documentation" and deleted "document source     view" per decision at [64]29 March 2001 teleconference to     implement [65]proposal from Ian.   * Event handlers: Cleaned up definition and added definition of     "explicitly associated event handler".   * Assistive technology: Added as another example of an AT     definition, link to AT act of 1998.      References     * Added [AT1998].    Techniques     * 1.2: Added query and non-query techniques. Added config option to     non-query technique.   * 1.2, 9.4: Added information about what constitutes an input device     event handler in HTML 4 and DOM 2.   * 2.5, 4.6: Added techniques for SMIL 1.0 user agents on recognizing     as captions what is guarded by the system-captions test attribute.   * 2.7: Added very little in the way of examples of conditional     content.   * 3.4: Added technique to increase granularity of on/off control.   * 8.2: Added link to W3C tech reports page.   * 9.4: per [66]29 March teleconf : added technique to restore state     variables after refresh of content. Removed first technique since     part of checkpoint now.   * 11.4: mention that entering a special mode (e.g, via one key) and     having single key bindings after that is also useful.      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't believe we should have a checkpoint specific to style sheets,  even though they would enable user agents to satisfy many of the  checkpoints. In fact, we went from a checkpoint about style sheets  to one more generally about supporting W3C specs.    On the other hand, a note in the Techniques (or even the Guidelines)  about how an implementation of CSS1 (or CSS2) would satisfy  many checkpoints (and which ones) would be helpful.    Hakon, do you still have a list of checkpoints you feel would be  satisfied? Can you make that available to the WG?    You might want to look at the latest version [2] from 9 August.

This is being debated now on the list. I proposed deleting  this checkpoint [3] in favor of other solutions.

      23 May 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0186    Minutes of previous meeting 18 May:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0174    Next meetings: 24, 25, 30   Regrets for 24th: Denis    Present:    Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (scribe), Denis Anson,   Mickey Quenzer, David Poehlman, Jim Allan, Gregory Rosmaita,   Tim Lacy    Absent: Rich Schwerdtfeger  Regrets: Eric Hansen, Harvey Bingham    Reference document 11 April 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/    ----------  Announcements  ----------     - IJ: Document in preparation.   - Len Kasday memorial service tomorrow, 24 May 2001    ----------  Discussion  ----------    #485: 10.2, 10.4, 10.7: "Provide a mechanism" what must be         done through the UI?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#485    Q: Is the API requirement for UI controls necessary, or is it just  necessary to provide access to UA functionalities?     TL: IE lets you trigger some functionalities through an API that  doesn't involve UI controls. You can get and set different properties  of elements (mostly content), and then these elements are rendered  through the UI. Say the focus is on a button. An assistive technology  can query the DOM or MSAA trees for information about the button.    IJ: For example, can you print without manipulating UI control  objects?    TL: Yes.    DA: The reason for APIs is to have a standard method.    JG: I think we're missing a requirement that ATs be able to *activate*  UI controls of the conforming user agent.    IJ: I think writing to a control has that effect.    TL: Yes.    Proposal:     - The requirement is that the user be able to operate the same     functionalities that are available to the user through the     user interface.   - Write access to UI controls is preferred.   - Read access is still required.    IJ: I could see the WG saying "The abstract requirement of  programmatic operation is fine, but the real world today   means that the API needs to interact with the UI controls."    JG: We can talk about this at the teleconf with ATs.    TL: I don't have an example of an AT interacting with IE other than  through UI controls.    JG: AOL has a custom API for some reasons.    TL: But it is possible to write a browser where Trident handles the  content, but the container is written in such a way that you would  only be able to access the UI controls through a specialized UI.    IJ: Would it be desirable or permissable to have an API that allows  the AT to operate the user agent entirely without ever touching the   native UI?    Resolved cascade for checkpoint 6.4:     a) Requirement is for programmatic operation of what       can be done through the user agent user interface.   b) If available and appropriate, use an API that allows       read/write access to UI controls.    ----------  Question: Are configuration files a sufficient "mechanism"  for 10.2, 10.4, and 10.7?    GR: In order for this to be of use, then the syntax needs to  be well-documented.    DA: Would it be considered acceptable to set the Windows features  through the registry only?    IJ: I would let the market decide here..    DA: One risk would be that the developers push accessibility  features into a text init file.     TL: The UI for configuring the UA needs to be accessible, however you  do it. If everyone is relegated to a text file, then I think that the  requirement would be met.    /* TL leaves */    Proposed:    - Configuration files would satisfy checkpoints       10.2, 10.4, and 10.7.    - Include strong recommendation to provide access through      the user interface as well.    DA: People who are not hackers, or who have a cognitive  disability cannot configure the UA through an init file.    IJ: Slight contradiction with style sheets, though. We have no  requirements about *how* you edit style sheets, only that they be  applicable and selectable. Tantek wants to implement the focus  highlight through style sheets. The user agent override the style  through user style sheets.    MQ: Editable text configuration files are useful.    DA proposal:     - It is not acceptable to provide inaccessible user interface     controls to meet the requirements of this document,     and to compensate with configuration files. If a     control is provided, it must be accessible (and it's fine to     have an alternative configuration mechanism such as an     editable configuration file).   - If no user interface control at all (for anyone), then     configuration file suffices.    JA: IE 5.5 (Windows and Mac) lets you create and apply user style  sheets. (under Tools/Internet Options/Accessibility/..).    GR: IE's style sheet support is truly minimal.    Resolved:     - Say in techniques for 10.2, 10.4, 10.7 that configuration     files are ok.   - If editable configuration files are used,      document the syntax etc. of the configuration files.   - Recommend that these features *also* be configurable     through the user interface.   - In techniques for 11.6, if profile is editable, document     the syntax and semantics.   - In techniques for 12.2, state that documentation of     configuration files when used to satisfy other requirements.     Give example of focus style through style sheets.    For the record:     - Possible P2 requirement (in future document) that any     configuration be possible through the UI.      #486: 12.2, 12.4, 12.5: Definition of features that benefit         accessibility.   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#486    Resolved:   - Accept Ian's proposed editorial changes to 8.1, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5   - Move definition of "features that benefit accessibility" to     checkpoint 12.2 (not in the Note).    #487: 12.5: "All changes" is too broad (for a number of reasons)   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#487    GR: You don't have to document code changes. There is no low-level  code change requirement.     MQ: Would it clarify things if you said "things that affect  usability"?    JG: Is this just about the user interface?    GR: No, functionalities as well (e.g., support for "longdesc").    GR Proposal:     - Document changes to user agent functionality and      user interface that affect accessibility.    DA: If the user has to do something different, tell them.    IJ: Should 12.5 be a P3?    GR: There's a problem of changes to the help system, which would not  let me read the rest of the documentation.    IJ: I disagree with this reasoning. I think that a new user is  in the same boat.    /* Ian drops request to lower 12.5 to P3 */    Proposed:     - 12.5 Document changes to user agent functionality and user   interface that affect accessibility.    DA: What about changes to APIs? You don't want products to break  suddenly.    JG: I don't think that Guideline 12 is really about documentation  for developers. Therefore, I don't think that changes to API  should be part of 12.5. We might talk about developer documentation  requirements in a future UAAG.    Resolved:     - 12.5 Document changes to user agent functionality and user   interface that affect accessibility.    #488: Glossary: Is the glossary normative or informative?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#488    GR: I am against splitting the glossary into normative/non-normative.    Resolved:     - Add to glossary something like:        "This is a normative glossary, although some of the terms (or      parts of explanations of terms) do not affect conformance."    #489: Does "document source" include HTTP headers?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#489    Resolved:     - Yes, HTTP headers are part of document source.   - "Document source" isn't really used in our document. Document     object is (and HTTP headers have already been taken into account).   - No change to the document.    DP: But what is "text source" in 2.2?    IJ: Good question. We eliminated "document source" to avoid this  problem.    JG: I think it's the text bits that the user agent receives, and is  the basis on which the document object is constructed. Our assumption  is that it does not include meta information from the transport  protocol.    Resolved:     - In definition of document source, state that it is prior to repair.   - In checkpoint 2.2, state that the text source is *prior* to     repair. It's a text "resource manifestation" as used in [WEBCHAR].    ----------------------  Completed Action Items  ----------------------    6.JG: Schedule a telecon with AT developers on changes    Source:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0174    10.DP and GR: Produce an example scenario to justify this checkpoint   9.5 and to satisfy Issue #482    Source:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0164  Done:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0204    11.DA: Write Loretta Reid for info about Adobe APIs used for   accessibility, including security features    Source:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0174  Done:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0173    The following will be done in the next draft:    1.IJ: Edit the text of checkpoints 2.1, 2.2, 8.1, and 8.2 so that UAs   are not required to conform for all formats that are implemented.

Windows Media player offers both: rewind a little, rewind to the  beginning  (according to the help documentation)    RealPlayer offers rewind a little (but there is buffering).   To go back to the beginning, you stop the stream, then hit play.    QuickTime player on Windows offers three functionalities  (for both forward and reverse directions):     a) Back to beginning/end   b) Step back/forward   c) Fast reverse/forward.    Since the "fast reverse" functionality is implemented by at  least these three tools, I think we should change checkpoint 4.6  to read "start, stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and   fast rewind audio, video, and animations".    We can define "fast advance" and "fast rewind" in the techniques  document and say, for example, that the speed of the advance/rewind  may vary based on how long the user requests it, etc.     - Ian    P.S. I would like to find more implementation information on  audio and animation support.     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Here's an issue: does it have to be for the Web? Does an intranet count?  in the UAGL, we are facing a similar puzzle: we say that documentation  must conform to the WCAG.

      Hello,    I received an action item to review the order of the guidelines  and propose a new order based on importance. Here are  some  of the criteria I used for sorting:      i) Number of high priority checkpoints in the guideline   ii) Semantic grouping of related guidelines  iii) Rough division in two groups:          a) Reduce inaccessibility          b) Promote accessibility       Perhaps the (a) group is more important than the (b) group.        Note that this is only a rough notion.    Here's the proposal:    1) Support input and output device-independence     [All priority 1 checkpoints]    2) Ensure keyboard access to user agent functionalities     [This one is related to device-independence and so the first two  should     be close.]    3) Ensure user access to document content     [This one might follow the next two, but seems very     important since it's about availability of content.]    4) Allow the user to turn off features that may reduce accessibility     [Lots of Priority 1, but this is because the ideas are finely     grained.]    5) Ensure user control over document styles     [The previous two should be close]    6) Observe system conventions and standard interfaces     7) Support applicable W3C technologies and guidelines     [Should be close to previous one]    8) Provide navigation mechanisms     9) Help orient the user     [The previous two should be close]    10) Notify the user of document and view changes     11) Allow the user to configure the user agent     12) Provide accessible product documentation and help      [Still important, but someone has to be number twelve!]     - Ian    Reference Document:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990809   --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

How about this positive spin:    "By automating accessibility tasks that can be carried out   by the computer, authoring tools allow authors to invest their   time and energy in those accessibility practices that require human   judgement and creativity."    - Ian

      Hello,    I regret that due to a very tight schedule for the Web  Content Accessibility Guidelines, I will not be  able to attend the call this week. I regret particularly  that I had committed to scribe and now I must retract  that offer.      - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      Hello,    Since I was out of the UAGL loop during the final   phases of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  Recommendation, I have been catching up on email and minutes,   and retracing a lot of the discussions, proposals,  and resolutions. I wrote the attached summary as a way to   keep track of what's been going on.     The only proposals in this summary have to do with  restructuring current content. There are no proposed  checkpoints or checkpoint changes. I may turn this  summary into some proposals once the WG has commented.  There are a few open questions in the summary.    Please let me know whether you think this indeed  sums up where we are,     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Telephone May 1999 only:     (212) 688-4489  Cell phone May 1999:         (917) 450-8783  Otherwise Tel/Fax:           (212) 684-1814        text/html attachment: 31-uagl.html          

      Al, Daniel,    At the 24 November UAGL teleconf [1], I was given an action  item to propose to this WG the adoption of the term "synchronized  equivalent" or "synchronized alternative" (proposed by Eric Hansen in  [5])  instead of the term used in the last call draft [2],   "continuous equivalent (track)".    There is some precedent for the new term. From WCAG 1.1, checkpoint 1.4:    <BLOCKQUOTE>    1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g.,        a movie or animation), synchronize equivalent        alternatives (e.g., captions or auditory descriptions of the        visual track) with the presentation.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    The term "continuous equivalent track" first appears in the SMIL  Access Note [4].    Please let the UAGL WG know if the term "synchronized equivalent"  accurately describes captions, auditory descriptions, or other  alternative formats that must be synchronized with an audio or  video track.

For Java, try [1], [2], [3]. I looked at the Macromedia site but  didn't find information about accessibility there.    For the need you are expressing: Quick access to key accessibility  features that need to be used or implemented, we are producing  Notes for W3C Technologies. There is one available for CSS 1/2 [4],  an older one for HTML 4 [5], and very soon one for SMIL 1.0. Other  Notes will follow.     - Ian      [1] "IBM Guidelines for Writing Accessible Applications Using 100% Pure  Java"      http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/snsjavag.htm    [2] Java Accessibility Utilities      http://www.sun.com/access/    [3] "Java Accessibility Guidelines and Checklist"      http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/accessjava.html    [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS-access    [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/HTML4-access.html     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Proposed rewrite:        To "check for" an accessibility problem means that it is      identified by the tool in at least one of the following ways:         a) Where it is possible to identify a problem from syntax, the          tool must automate this check. For example, check for the          presence of the "alt" attribute on the HTML IMG element.         b) Where it is possible to identify a problem mechanically but          not directly from syntax, the tool should automate this          check. For example, calculate whether two colors do not          provide sufficient contrast when compared to user preferences.          When the tool's calculations are best guesses (e.g.,           linearization of a page), prompt the user to confirm the          results.         c) Otherwise, prompt the user to verify accessibility. For  instance,          if an image has an associated long description, ask the user          to confirm that the description is appropriate for the           image. Subtle, rather than extensive, prompting is more likely          to be effective in encouraging the user to verify accessibility.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    Having published the 13 January 2001 draft of  the UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and Techniques, I thought  it might be helpful to summarize where I think we  are.      - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010113    1) There are 26 open issues. See my summary of them     below.    2) Once we have resolved the remaining issues, we      need to respond to each reviewer and explain our     resolutions. If we have not convinced     a reviewer to withdraw an objection, then we     present the objection to the Director in our      request to advance to the next stage of the process.          Suggested Action IJ: I will probably be the one to write      emails to all the reviewers explaining the WG's      resolutions.    3) We have to decide whether we wish to return to     Candidate Recommendation for implementation      experience, or request that the Director advance     the document directly to Proposed Recommendation.     I think that we will probably discuss that at     the face-to-face meeting based revisions     of the guidelines and the implementation report.     Where we have weak implementation experience, we     may decide to seek out implementations or to      delete some requirements.       Suggested Action IJ: Prepare a new implementation report     for the face-to-face meeting.         Suggested Action Working Group: Keep sending implementation     reports to the list!    4) Timeline. This is not an official timeline, just     a projection by me.            4.1) We complete our open issues over the next three        teleconferences: 18 Jan, 22 Jan (a Monday), and        25 Jan. In order to complete the open issues        rapidly:         a) You are strongly encouraged to attend the          teleconferences.       b) I include some rough proposals for some of           the issues below.       4.2) During the month of February:        a) Send responses to reviewers and document           any outstanding objections.        b) Prepare a new implementation report.        c) Create a stable version of the guidelines           for review by the Working Group before the           face to face meeting.       4.3) 1-2 March: Face-to-face meeting in Cambridge.         4.4) If we decide to request to advance directly        to Proposed Recommendation, then:          a) We need to ensure that we have implementation           experience for all of our requirements. In           some cases, I don't believe we need to show           implementation experience because other groups           are responsible for this (e.g., WCAG or DOM).          b) Suppose the Director sends the Proposed Rec           to the Advisory Committee on 21 March (which           gives us several weeks to deal with issues that           arise at the face-to-face meeting). That           means that PR ends 18 April, we allow 3 weeks           to address issues that were raised, one week to           prepare the document, and UAAG 1.0 becomes a           Recommendation around 15 May.       4.5) If we decide to spend some time in Candidate          Recommendation, add a couple of months to this          timeline.    ----------------------------------------------  Status of remaining issues and some proposals  ----------------------------------------------    321, 322, 358, 359:     These are all about definitions and editorial changes     (to checkpoint 2.3 and possibly a couple of others).      Status: Eric, Al, and Ian are still working on a proposal    to resolve these issues.    324: How do developers interpret the phrase        "appropriate for a task" in checkpoint 6.2       Status: Awaiting discussion of proposal from Ian:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0437.html     327: Add requirement for support of charset expected of each API?      Status: We resolved to add a requirement at 16 Nov    face-to-face.  Awaiting discussion of proposal from Ian:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0088.html    373: Checkpoint 10.5: Propose raising to Priority 1      Proposed: The reviewer suggests raising the priority of the    checkpoint to document changes that affect accessibility from    P2 to P1.      Proposed by IJ: Don't raise this priority. It's already P1 to    document all features that benefit accessibility. Therefore,    while useful, lack of documentation of the changes specifically    would not make understanding the documentation impossible.    382: Checkpoint 3.2: Hard to do in many cases (e.g., when scripts  used).      Status: I wrote the reviewer asking for more details and have    not heard back yet except that the reviewer acknowledged    reception of my request.       Proposed by IJ: Since 3.2 is about animated images, not all    animated effects, scripting is not an issue. No change to the    document.    389: Conformance: Hard to test conformance in an objective       fashion.      Status: I wrote the reviewer with clarifications and asked for    comment. No response yet.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0038.html      Proposed by IJ: We have reduced some of the conformance    requirements as a result of the reviewer's comments. We have    worked very hard on this conformance scheme and rejected a    number of others. If the reviewer has specific suggestions, we    will consider them.    394: Checkpoint 2.1: Vague about what cannot be provided through       a source view.      Status: Awaiting discussion of proposal from Ian:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0043.html    443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse)       specific events.      Status: The document currently requires emulation of    mouse-specific controls by virtue of our requirement that the    user must be able to do everything through the mouse.      Discussion:         a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific    bindings specified by the author?      b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse    events through the keyboard benefits the user?    444: Guideline 1 rationale needs clarification.      Proposed: Guideline 1 rationale needs editing based on our    change to checkpoint 1.1 (and not requiring that the user    enable mouse-only operation of the user agent in order to    conform). I believe that this is editorial and that the WG    doesn't need to spend time on it.    445: Checkpoint 1.3: What about systems that do not use the       keyboard at all, but provide accessibility solutions?      Proposed by IJ: UAAG 1.0 is designed to promote accessibility    of the Web for users with many types of disabilities. Keyboard    access is considered fundamental for this. This document is not    designed to promote the accessibility of specialized user    agents.  Therefore no change to our requirements.    446: Checkpoint 6.1: Consider making the checkpoint scalable       (variable priority linked to WCAG).      Proposed by reviewer: Make checkpoint 6.1 a relative priority    checkpoint with respect to WCAG 1.0.      Status: We have already discussed this (refer to issue 111 [2])    and resolved to leave this a priority one checkpoint. The    rationale has been that if user agents don't implement    features, authors will never be able to use them. Therefore,    UAAG 1.0 must "lead".      [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111    447: Conformance by default w.r.t. configuration requirements      Status: The reviewer's comment was that the document said that    the user agent should work by default. But since the document    requires lots of configurability to meet the different needs    of users, for which users should the document work by    default? The problematic sentence in the last call draft was          "Note: User agent developers are strongly encouraged to      design software that conforms in the default configuration."      That statement has been removed from the 13 January 2001     draft because it doesn't make sense: You don't "conform"     in the default configuration. You simply conform or you don't.      Therefore, unless there are objections or other comments. I     would consider this issue resolved.    448: Checkpoint 5.7: Is CSS read-only or read/write?       [This is checkpoint 5.9 in the 13 January 2001 draft.]      The reviewer's comment was "Is this section referring to    viewing the page or editing the page? Why would a user need to    access the CSS when viewing a document?"      Proposed IJ: Make this requirement read-only access.       - We already require that a conforming user agent       allow the user to select and apply user style sheets       (checkpoint 4.15 in 13 Jan 2001 draft).       - We require that the user be able to operate the user       agent through keyboard alone.       - Therefore, the user should be able to apply user style       sheets through the conforming UA's user interface. ATs       do not need to write to user style sheets through       an API.       Can people suggest a scenario where the AT would need to    write to the conforming user agent's user style sheet    through an API?    449: Create an executive summary for UAAG 1.0       Proposed by IJ: I agree that a 2-page summary of the    UAAG 1.0 as an appendix would be a useful addition.      Suggested Action editors: Write an executive summary.    450: If UA is implemented in Java, what system conventions should       it follow?      The reviewer's comment: "Several checkpoints refer to using    operating system conventions. What about a user agent that is    written in Java? In that case it is up to the virtual machine    to use the system conventions. Checkpoints that this might    affect: 1.3, 5.8, 8.6, 9.2. Also, section 3.2."      Comments from Al Gilman on this topic [3]:         "I believe that the UAAG as is should win out on this point.       That is to say, I believe that the UAAG never says simply       'follow OS conventions.'"      Status: Several checkpoints in the 13 January 2001 draft refer    only to OS conventions: 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, and 5.13.       Discussion: Should "OS conventions" be "system conventions"    (where system may include a programming environment) for    some or all of these checkpoints?      [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0370.html    451: Checkpoint 2.6: Generalize to decorative content, not just       null alt       (Checkpoint 2.7 in 13 January 2001 draft)      Proposed by IJ: This proposal came from the WCAG WG, which is    working on requirements in WCAG 2.0. For the moment UAAG 1.0 is    based on WCAG 1.0, and this is a repair checkpoint for when the    author has not met the WCAG 1.0 requirement of providing an    equivalent. I propose that we not increase the scope of the    checkpoint in this version of the document, and consider a    broader checkpoint in a later version of UAAG that would be    based on WCAG 2.0. We have edited 2.6 to make it more format    based.    452: Checkpoint 2.2: Review minimal requirement (three options?)       The reviewer writes: You need to provide more options to    companies to address different types of situations and uses for    timing. Suggest a 3 option approach 1 - user can turn off all    timing OR 2 - user can adjust the timing to 5 times (or 10    times) the default setting. OR 3 - user is offered more time    and has at least 10 seconds to respond to offer.      Proposed by IJ: We resolved that the minimal requirement was    to pause the presentation since we could not determine    with certainty that fixed time delays (or multiples as the     reviewer suggests) would be useful. This sounds like a useful    configuration option for the techniques document.     453: Checkpoint 3.5: Generalize to "programmatic objects"       Status: For issue 364 [4], we resolved to include plug-ins.    Refer to Ian's request to review this resolution [5] since    plug-ins are not author-supplied.       Proposed by IJ: I don't know what "programmatic objects"    includes besides scripts, applets, and plug-ins. Why     exclude more? There are no other checkpoints that would use    the term "programmatic objects", so I'd prefer to be explicit    rather than abstract here unless there are other programmatic    objects that aren't covered.      [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-364     [5]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0025.html    454: Checkpoints 3.6/3.7: Should these be Priority 1?       (These are the redirect checkpoints, currently P2     requirements.)      Discussion: If the user can't control redirects and refresh,    will access to some content be impossible?      Comment by IJ: I can see the reviewer's point. However, I am    reticent to raise the priorities at this stage.    455: Guideline 4: Change to "Ensure user control of       presentation"?      Proposed by IJ (Editorial):      - Move checkpoints 4.15-4.19 to Guideline 8. These seem      to be more about viewport, focus, and other UI behavior,      rather than styles.      - Change Guideline 4 title to "Ensure user control of       rendering and styles". I prefer not using the term      "presentation" since we use that term in the context      of multimedia presentation.    456: Editorial: Need to clarify in section 3.2 that we do not       mean system APIs.      The reviewer's comment: "It was my understanding of this    section that if a standard accessibility API does not exist for    an operating system, that the developer must create and use    their own. This would cause an AT developer to learn a    different API for each browser on a platform that did not have    an accessibility API."      Comment by IJ: Section 3.2 of that draft was about using    OS features as part of conformance. I don't understand the    reviewer's comment w.r.t. that section. I would note that    our current checkpoint 5.6 states:             "5.6 Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the      operating system and supported programming languages)."      This doesn't mean that if one doesn't exist you have to    invent your own; it wouldn't be standard.    457: Checkpoint 5.4: Ambiguity about what exactly required:  standard APIs only?        Checkpoint 5.4 is about read/write access to UI controls    through standard APIs.      Discussion: From Wendy's comment and after discussion with    Charles, it seems that this checkpoint is not clear: is access    to UI controls required even when there is no std API for doing    so?    458: Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an  image map? What is required granularity?      Proposed IJ:     - User must be able to activate all links.     - For image maps specifically, I would argue that the       image map as a whole needs to be highlighted, but not       individual links.  --  Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I think the requirement is stronger than what you are suggesting.  Graphical  desktop browsers are, in fact, required by these guidelines   to make information available to ATs. It's a Priority 1 requirement  (checkpoints 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6), hence "must".      > Also, the following  > statement --which appears numerous times-- makes no sense to me:   >   >       o Links to definitions are highlighted through the use of style sheets.   >   > The offending phrase is through the use of style sheets.

Links to definitions are indicated graphically with green, italic text  by  default. The idea was to allow users to specify their own style  preferences  for that class of links if desired. We try to expose the use of style  sheets for this purpose without going so far as to say  "class="dfn-instance")  Note that we also use: rel="glossary" and title="Definition of XYZ" in  the  link, so there's no shortage of information.        > Section 2  >   > Guideline 2  >   > Nit:word closed is repeated in:   >   >       of closed closed captions (or subtitles) available (e.g., in     Fixed.     > Guideline 3:  >   > In 3.7, the statement   >   >       Users should be able, for security reasons, to prevent scripts from executing on their machines.   >   > though factually true has nothing to do with accessibility --especially the way it is tacked on to the bit about  > avoiding flicker.

Perhaps the note belongs in the techniques document. The question that  motivated the Note was: Is it possible to conform to the DOM while   doing more than what the DOM specifies?

      Hello,    Judy sent a lot of great comments about the latest draft,  and I'd like to add a few.      >3. The guidelines themselves should be as directly stated as possible. Use  >the active voice (actually, the imperative -- start each guideline with a  >verb), which has more impact, and is easier to understand and translate  >than passive voice (see 3.C.4).    I agree, although some of the wording in the current guidelines   is probably mine. If the imperative is used, the guidelines  must clearly indicate who is the understood "you".    Thus, the table of contents would become something like:    3.A Integration of accessibility awareness              3.A.1 Support all accessiblity features of relevant  languages                     (HTML, CSS, SMIL, XML, etc.)              3.A.2 Emphasize accessible authoring practices               3.A.3 Expose all inaccessible markup              3.A.4 Promote accessibility awareness in tool suites              3.A.5 Integrate accessibility features naturally              3.A.6 Allow users to configure levels of accessibility  awareness    3.B Provision of accessibility information              3.B.1 Provide context-sensitive accessibility help to  authors              3.B.2 Provide rationales that stress Universal Design              3.B.3 Offer practical and accessible solutions in examples              3.B.4 Package multimedia files with pre-written descriptions    3.C Accessibility Task automation              3.C.1 Allow the user to check for and correct accessibility                    problems automatically              3.C.2 Ensure that all markup inserted through the user  interface                    is accessible              3.C.3 Ensure that conversion tools produce accessible markup              3.C.4 Avoid removing or modifying existing structure or                    descriptive content              3.C.5 Offer dedicated accessibility tools      One problem is that not all of these entries "strike me" (for example  3.C.5 and  3.B.3). I recommend narrowing the scope of these guidelines slightly so  that  a stronger message is apparent.    I have some questions about 3.C.4. There are two phenomena we can  describe  here: (1) the structure and content of a document, and (2)  the way the characters appear in a file. As an author, I am always  frustrated  by authoring tools that modify (2). Authoring tools that reformat files  wreak havoc, for example, on archiving tools such as CVS. This  phenomenon,  however, is probably not the focus of this guideline. The guideline  states  that authoring tools should not modify existing structure. I think  instead that we should say:        - Authoring tools must be allowed to change a document to make        it more accessible. (They should be able to read inaccessible        markup and write accessible markup).        - Authoring tools must allow users to know when such changes are        made. I could easily imaging working with a trustworthy tool with        the option "Tell me when you've modified the document" turned off.        Although in general I don't appreciate software doing things        behind my back, in this case, I would rather not be interrupted        is the only changes being made are to promote accessibility. Users        should be able to choose to be notified or not.    In general, I recommend that the guidelines allow users to turn on  and off certain features. For example, 3.A.3 already reads "All  authoring tools for a specific markup languagemust be capable of  searching [for] and flagging inaccessible markup...Authors must  be made aware of the existing and location of inaccessible markup  as soon as possible..." I think users need to be able to configure  their tools so that they may be informed at different times. For  instance, I don't like Word to show me spelling and grammar errors  by underlining text (it's distracting, it hurts performance  etc.). I would rather check for spelling errors in a different  phase of editing (in batch mode, actually). In short, authoring  tools must provide certain functionalities, but allow the user  to configure the tool according to taste (this could/should actually  be a guideline related to the user interface of tools).    I'll have more comments soon,     - Ian     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I still think that we need to allow  the user agent developer to provide access through the UI  rather than in content. Here's a shot:     <NEW_UI>   2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives,      provide easy access to the alternative equivalents      through at least one of the following mechanisms:      - Allowing configuration to render alternative         instead of primary content.      - Allowing configuration to render alternative in addition to        primary content.      - Providing a direct link to the alternative in content,        just before or after the primary content.      - Allowing the user to select the primary content and then        inspect its alternatives.   <NEW_UI>    Notes:    1) I put back the word "easy" since that helps understand the     rationale.    2) I hesitate to put four techniques in a checkpoint, but if   implementing any one of them would mean that the UA met the  requirement, then I'm ok with that level of specificity.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Most of what the individual should do is a question of how to process your  complaint through customer service and escalate when not receiving  satisfaction.  This working group may not be the best place to find the  answer to that kind of question.    Geocities, for example, responded well in the end to a flap caused when  they added a watermark that destroyed access to the pages posted there.    A WCAG topic that this question suggests is: "Are the accessibility  techniques for server side image maps covered in the techniques document?"  Specifically, that the server-side image map should respond to (0,0)  coordinates with an alternate navigation page, and that clients should send  (0,0) when a server-side image map is activated without the mouse pointer  in the area, as by keyboard tabbing and <enter>.    Do the server add-ins include text links equivalent to the sensitive image?    Al      >  >  >David M.

      Hello,    I spoke with both AOL and Adobe today and have a few notes from  those meetings. Based on our very useful discussion, I hope that  both companies will send in formal last call comments. I would  like to thank them for taking the time to chat with me and to  review the document!    Below I have jotted down some remarks that I don't think would be  part of a review by either company.     Reference document: 9 April 2001 draft [1].     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-UAAG10-20010409/    ---------------------------------------------  Issue 1) Is focus always required?  [Proposal]  ---------------------------------------------    A number of checkpoints make requirements related to the content  focus: 1.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.5, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6,  10.2, 10.3, 10.7, 10.8, and 11.5. If the format does not include  any interactive elements, what should become of the focus  requirements? For instance, if a user agent is rendering a movie  format or an image format where there is no interactivity (in the  sense of interactive elements) by specification, what should  happen to the focus requirements?    Proposed:    Perhaps the answer is that these checkpoints don't apply because  the format doesn't allow the user agent to recognize (or control)  enabled elements.    ---------------------------------------------  Issue 2) Checkpoint 9.3: Plug-ins and history  [No proposal]  ---------------------------------------------     Suppose that a plug-in is used to render a particular image  format in a viewport "V". Who is responsible for maintaining the  history information (of focus, selection, and point of regard)  when the user takes focus from "V" and then gives it back to "V"  later? Is it the plug-in's responsibility? Or another module of  the user agent (in which case, what is the API used to send  history information back to the plug-in)?    ---------------------------------------------  Issue 3) Checkpoints 3.2/4.4: All animated images?  [No proposal]  ---------------------------------------------     It's not clear that all animated image formats make sense with  the requirements of checkpoint 3.2. For instance, those animated  images "in a box" make sense (e.g., with respect to placeholders  that are also "box-like"), but other animated SVG images may not  be "box-like".    There may be some cases where certain animations are authored in  a way that makes certain requirements not really apply. For  instance, it's possible to author an SVG animation where the  animation changes based on user input. What does "fast forward"  mean for such an image (checkpoint 4.5). In other cases, there  may be interdependencies among animations that make the  element-level control of 4.4 difficult or impossible (these are  the animations that are not "box-like")..    I hope that the Adobe review will help us get clarification on  these technical issues.    --------------  Clarifications  --------------    Here are some proposed minor clarifications:     - The definition of user agent mentions plug-ins (as potential     components of a conforming user agent). They should also be     mentioned in the definition of viewport, and possibly in      the Note after checkpoint 9.1, since a plug-in may contribute     a viewport to the set of (navigable) viewports.     - There are some bugs in the definition of "explicit user     request". The term "recognize" is used, and that is part of     the definition, but the user agent may recognize something      that the *user* doesn't know about (e.g., because it's part     of the markup that the user doesn't see). We need to clarify     how an "explicit user request" is identified. I don't have     a proposal today.     --------------  Techniques  --------------     - Add more techniques about plug-in interfaces.   - Checkpoint 3.6: Add the same HTML markup used in 3.5.    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I've published the 21 November Techniques document [1], which  integrates many of the techniques sent lately by people in the  WG. I have not listed the changes explicitly at [2] since  they are numerous and spread out all over. However techniques  from Jon Gunderson, Rich Schwerdtfeger, David Poehlman, Gregory  Rosmaita, Jim Allan, Mickey Quezner, and Madeleine Rothberg  were incorporated.     More to come...     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991121/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Thus, after "6.

What if  > some links reoccur? Are they counted? First occurrence number used?    This is meant to refer to element instances (not link text or link  destinations). Thus, every "A" element is numbered (uniquely). It's  useful to know that I'm on the 75th link of the document if I  have a navigation mechanism that lets me return to it (by number).    I admit, this is very technique-y as it suggests numbering links  as a way of letting readers know where they are. There are undoubtedly  other techniques. For this reason, I question whether these  checkpoints should be checkpoints at all (to be discussed at the  23 June teleconf).     >UL 2, LI 2.    > [Should a "download progress" indication be available?]    Refer to checkpoint 8.14     > [Should we include a suggestion to download text and ALT="..." before images?]    This could appear in the techniques document, but in my opinion  goes to far in suggesting an implementation. The purpose of the  checkpoint is not to ensure fast downloads (though this is interesting)  but to provide a measure of progress (whatever the speed).     > >3.1 Conformance  >   > >Conformance claims  >   > [Suggest if dependent UA, further qualify limits expected by that UA.

If author, should audible  > style sheets be a separate list item?]    I would suggest that "support for author style sheets" means that  they are parsed and cascaded with other style sheets according to   the style sheet spec.

      Jon,    Please add to the agenda an item about the UA Guidelines dependency  on DOM Level 2. The DOM Working Group has been held up in their process  of different interpretations of the XML namespaces Recommendation [1]  by various XML Working Groups. Since it might be a while before DOM   Level 2 advances to Proposed Recommendation, we might want to change  our DOM requirements to DOM 1 so that we can move forward. Please  note that if we make this change (which is significant, even if it's  motived by a process issue, not a consensus issue), we may not be  able to move directly to Recommendation. This would be the subject  of the agenda item.

      Phill,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed your last call  issues (360-370).    The complete second last call issues list [1] is available  online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been  incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].      NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call    draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have    been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.    Please indicate whether you are satisfied with the UAWG's  resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment.  Refer to section 5.5.2 of the 8 February 2001 W3C Process  Document [3] for information about requirements to formally  address issues prior to advancing to last call.

In this configuration, provide an     option to alert the user when executable content is available (but     has not been executed)."    ---------------------  #368: Checkpoint 10.1: Use relative priority       Comment: As you know from our face-to-face meeting in     Cambridge [6], there is not agreement in the Working Group    about the priority of this checkpoint (some participants    demand Triple-A WCAG 1.0 conformance, others Single-A or    relative priority scheme). Thus, for the moment, the Chair    has resolved to leave the requirement as is: Double-A    WCAG 1.0 conformance for checkpoint 12.1.      [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes    ===============================================  The UAWG agreed with you, but please confirm:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #367: Checkpoint 1.2: Clarification required for cross-platform  implementations, published APIs, more      Comment: Checkpoint 1.2 has been subsumed by checkpoint 6.6,    which I believe is in the spirit of your suggestion:       "6.6 Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the operating     environment). Where these APIs do not enable the user agent to     satisfy the requirements of this document, use the standard input     and output APIs of the operating environment."    --------------------  #370: Checkpoint 7.6: Clarification required on how important elements  identified      Comment: Checkpoint 9.9 has been clarified. The Note now reads:        "Note: This specification intentionally does not identify which      "important elements" must be navigable as this will vary according      to markup language. What constitutes "efficient navigation" may      depend on a number of factors as well, including the "shape" of      content (e.g., serial navigation of long lists is not efficient)      and desired granularity (e.g., among tables, then among the cells      of a given table). Refer to the Techniques document [UAAG10-TECHS]      for information about identifying and navigating important      elements."    ===============================================  The UAWG adopted your suggestion:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #360: Checkpoint 2.2: What if time interval controlled by server? What  about security issues?      Comment: Checkpoint 2.4 now states in the Note:        "Note: In this configuration, the user agent may have to pause the     presentation more than once, depending on the number of times input     is requested. In SMIL 1.0 [SMIL], for example, the "begin", "end",     and "dur" attributes synchronize presentation components. The user     may explicitly complete input in many different ways (e.g., by     following a link that replaces the current time-sensitive resource     with a different resource). This checkpoint does not apply when the     user agent cannot recognize the time interval in the presentation     format, or when the user agent cannot control the timing (e.g.,     because it is controlled by the server)."    ---------------------  #361: Checkpoint 4.14: List of options is too long / consider  ease-of-use       Comment: With you present at the WG's face-to-face meeting in    Cambridge [5], we split this checkpoint into three checkpoints:    4.13, 4.14, and 4.15.      [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes#speech    ---------------------  #365: Checkpoint 4.12: Re-evaluate priority of increase/decrease and  allow other techniques (also, other issues)      Comment: These have been removed from checkpoint 4.11, which now    reads:      "4.11 Allow configuration and control of the synthesized speech    playback rate, according to the full range offered by the speech    synthesizer.        Note: The range of playback rates offered by the speech        synthesizer may depend on the natural language."    ---------------------  #366: Editorial: Please put direct links to WAI resources.       Comment: Done.    ===============================================  The UAWG answered the following questions:  ===============================================    --------------------  #362: Checkpoint 2.7: Clarifications required (e.g., is this an  accessibility issue?)      Comment:       * The Working Group clarified the text of what is now checkpoint  2.10.      * The accessibility issue is that users who must access content        serially are spared (hence P3) the hassle of viewing content        that is rendered as "garbage" due to lack of support for the        natural language in question.    --------------------  #363: Checkpoint 3.3: What if scripts used for blinking? (also, other  issues)       Comment: As for other requirements in the document, if blinking    cannot be detected from the way the author has encoded information,    the checkpoint does not apply. Checkpoint 3.3 now reads:      "3.3 Allow configuration to render animated or blinking text as     motionless, unblinking text. [Priority 1]          Note: This checkpoint does not apply for blinking and animation       effects that are caused by mechanisms that the user agent cannot       recognize. This checkpoint requires configuration because       blinking effects may be disorienting to some users but useful to       others, for example users who are deaf or hard of       hearing."    --------------------  #369: Checkpoint 7.4: Conformance possible if you can't get to  elements with event handlers?      Comment: At the Cambridge face-to-face meeting [6], the Working    Group reiterated the requirement that users be able to     trigger event handlers explicitly associated with an element    in a device-independent manner. Please refer to checkpoints     9.1 through 9.7 in the 9 March 2001 draft. Note, however, that    at its 15 March teleconference [7], the Working Group decided to    lower the priority of checkpoint 9.3 to P2.

      Hi Amaya Team,    I saw that my request [1] related to start-up behavior  was integrated into v 4.3! Thank you for the quick  attention. I look forward to using the new version.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/2001JanMar/0124.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Scott,    As I read checkpoint 1.1 today, I think it may be a bug in the  spec [1] to have included frames in this list.     Frames are generally used to create a two-dimensional graphical   presentation. There's nothing inherently inaccessible about doing  that (though we hope CSS positioning will replace frames, and  frames are not promoted by W3C). However, if designed poorly,   a frameset may not linearize well -  relationships among   components may not "translate" to a serial rendering and therefore  a page may be unusable by users who access it serially (e.g.,  blind users).    Frames can be made accessible through a combination of efforts  by authors and user agents: authors are required to title frames  properly and to provide frameset alternatives when the frameset  does not make sense when linearized. User agents must provide  navigation mechanisms so that users can get at components quickly  when rendered linearly.     I do not believe that it is necessary to provide a   "text equivalent" for a frameset, notably one that only   contains text content. To make the frameset accessible, ensure  that is linearizes sensibly (frames should be titled for this  reason) and if not, provide an alternative to the frameset  that does. I note that it is preferable to avoid an alternative  page and to make the frameset accessible directly.  An alternative to the frameset need not be text exclusively,   as long as the alternative content is itself accessible (e.g.,   images with text equivalents, etc.).     I will forward these comments to the GL Working Group for   their consideration.

In the 9 March 2001 draft [1], checkpoints 3.2 and 3.7 both  include this sentence:       "When placeholders are rendered, allow the user      to activate each placeholder individually and       replace it with the original author-supplied content."    Based on our discussion during the teleconference that it  was also ok to have the user agent render the original  content "temporarily" in another viewport, I propose  not to state this in the techniques, but to change  the checkpoint text to allow this:       "When placeholders are rendered, allow the user       to view the original author-supplied content      on activation of each placeholder."    Then, in the techniques document, state:       "When a placeholder is activated, the user agent      may render the original content in context or in another      viewport."    I intend to include this text in the next draft, for there  was agreement at the teleconference that this was acceptable  behavior. If there are disagreements, please indicate whether  you disagree with the substance (i.e., rendering in another   viewport does not satisfy the user need) or the proposed text.

      Hello,    After 6 phone calls following the meeting today, I forgot  to send out the minutes...    Here are the raw minutes from the meeting. Sorry for the  delays.     - Ian    WAI UA Teleconf  8 June 2000     Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Denis Anson   Gregory Rosmaita   Harvey Bingham   Dick Brown   Jim Allan   Kitch Barnicle   Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets:     Eric Hansen   Tim Lacy    Next teleconference: June 15    Agenda [1]  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0406.html    1) Review of Action Items    Completed Action Items        1.All: Review config and control definition proposal by EH        2.All: Send situations/comments on why Checkpoint 4.8 should move to  P1        3.Editors: Update document based on MR proposal for control and         configure and the resolutions made during this telecon        4.Editors: Cross reference 4.8 and 4.10 and make clear that  checkpoint                  4.8 for non-syntheisized speech audio        6.JG: Contact Denis Anson related to importance of control of  objects             within control objects    Continued Action Items        5.IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers.             (No deadline.)        7.CMN: Propose a technique that explains how serialization plus              navigation would suffice for Checkpoint 8.1.        8.GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples  in             the techniques document.       GR: I finally got info from David.        9.KB: Propose a minimum or preferred set of functions that should be             available to single command configuration       KB: Later today.    2) Process status report        IJ: Do people agree that we've made enough changes to         return to last call?       GR: If we've done our job, we shouldn't get many new comments.         Also, we owe reviewers a chance to confirm our implementation.       IJ: "Going back" means to get signoff on changes, but not to         add new stuff. We need to be very conservative about changes;         no new stuff if possible - only trying to clarify our existing         requirements.       JG: We already have a lot of good stuff in the document to get         people started.       Suggested path:       1) 3-week last call.     2) Skipping CR.     3) Proposed Rec.       Availability of WG during next two months:     Good: DB, JA, IJ, KB (july better than june), GR,           IJ, HB     Bad : JG            On resolving issues in a new review:       JG: I propose telecons instead of a ftf meeting.       IJ: I will be working on        a) A new draft of the WD for the WG       b) Proposals to finish the min requirements.       c) Integrating the min requirements into the document.    3) Next ftf?       JG: Discussion in WAI CG the other day about meetings.         Our charter says we have to meet 4 times/year.     IJ: What about September?     JG: Yes, end of September, early October?     DB: Sounds good.     DA: Mid-semester for me, but not a busy semester.        JG: We need to find a host...     KB: Let's block out dates among ourselves as early as possible.     HB: Note - WAP and other mobile groups haven't been involved         in our activities. Perhaps we should invite them to participate.       Action JG: Send proposal to Judy proposal for WG ftf meeting     end September. Look for a host involved with multimedia or mobile.       4) PR#285: Raise checkpoint 4.8 "Allow the user to configure the audio              volume" to priority 1      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#283       DA: When there are background sounds (information)          drowning out voices, definitely a P1 issue. You need to         be able to control the speech volume independently to improve         the signal to noise ratio.       GR: There are a lot of cases where sounds are used to provide          information and turning off background sounds prevents access         to information.       JG: You could turn off sounds and then turn it on again to         get information. Sighted users have a "gestalt" view of the         content - they get info from images and background sounds and         other content at the same time, even if peripherally.       HB: Implementation sounds like a mixer panel.       IJ: Is there only ever one source of synthesized speech?         If there are several sources, are we requiring the UA         to support volume level for each one?       JG: Recall that P2 for this checkpoint was in part based on         the WCAG assumption that there's a P1 requirement for         text equivalents for sampled sounds. Therefore, the          information would still be available, even if you         turned off background sounds.       GR: What if the source is streamed, so you can recover it?       IJ: That's an implementation issue...       GR: Just because WCAG 1.0 requires a text equivalent doesn't         mean that it will be provided. This requirement is         P1 for cases (at least) where the text equivalent is         not available.          IJ: Any implementation about individual control of synth speech         volume?       JG: Yes. Current screen reader technology only allows configuration,         not dynamic control. Real Audio has a control on their media         player. In MS technology, you can control each voice volume         independently. Part of the SDK (speech development kit).       Straw poll:       Make P1: DA, GR, JA, HB       Don't know: JA, KB (but leaning to P1), IJ       Leave P2: DB       JG: There's no guarantee that if you implement this as a UA         that you will actually control the hardware. People could         turn the sound way up and still not be able to hear it.       IJ: Most speakers have physical controls.       KB: What if you can't make the physical changes.       IJ: Three issues:       a) Control of volume by software (by the user).       b) Relative volumes between audio and speech (bring          up the voice, for example).          HB: So we're talking about pre-mixing.       c) Just volume control in general (for people          who are hard of hearing).       Resolved: Change 4.10 to be "Allow the user to        control synthesized speech volume relative to       other audio sources. P1"       DB: Are we ignoring something else than synth speech that     should also be independently controlled? What about control     of contrast, for example?       IJ: Synth speech is a known important item. We will miss        some. Contrast has not come up with reviewers...       Proposed: Change 4.8 to P1 and say "If the operating       system does not provide a way to change audio       volume, allow the user to configure the audio        volume."       KB: But like other requirements, this is implicit :          you can meet a bunch of other requirements by just         using the OS features.       DB: Yes, we have assumed in some other cases that people         will go outside the UA to accomplish certain tasks.       Resolved: Leave 4.8 text as is, Raise to P1.       RS, DB: I can live with this.       Action editors:       1) Change priority; Reasoning - some users need this       2) Emphasize use of system-level (global) volume control.       3) Add to definition of "native support" something that          the OS controls don't have to be in the UA's user interface          itself. The UA uses the features, but doesn't have to          provide direct access to those controls.    5) Review of EH's proposed definition of "configure and control"     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0400.html       Resolved: Adopt this definition.        

      Hello,    Here's a proposed new checkpoint for 7.5:    <NEW>     7.5 Allow the user to search within all rendered text content         accessible through a viewport, including rendered         text content outside the point of regard.         Allow the user to start a forward search from a location          in content selected or focused by the user.          After a match, allow searching from location of the          match. Provide a case-insensitive search option when         applicable to the natural language of text. [Priority 2]   </NEW>    Add to Techniques:    1) When the point of regard depends on time (e.g., an audio  viewport), the user must be able to search through   content that will be available through that viewport. This  is analogous to content rendered graphically that is   reachable by scrolling.     2) The user must be allowed to search among rendered  text equivalents, as these are part of rendered text  content.     - Ian    Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   > Hello,  >   > Checkpoint 7.5 of the 18 August Guidelines [1] begins:  >   >     7.5 Allow the user to search for rendered text content,  >         including rendered text equivalents.  >   > The definition of "rendered content" is "that part of content  > rendered in a given viewport (whether visual, audio, or tactile)."  > This definition limits severely what type of search would  > be required through an audio viewport since there is very little  > content rendered aurally at any given moment.  >   > To fix this problem, I'd like to propose a model that seems  > to work for both two-dimensional and one-dimensional viewports:  >   a) A viewport does not reveal all rendered content at once.  >   b) The search requirement is for content that is rendered  >      through the viewport, even though that content may not  >      be available in the user's point of regard.  >   > I don't have a proposal for new wording yet.

My problem is that the word "user" appears five times in the sentence.  I don't find this expression of the requirement any clearer. I have  found this checkpoint requirement difficult to express in very very  short language.     _ Ian     > Jon  >   > Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP  > Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology  > Chair, W3C WAI User Agent Working Group  > Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services  > College of Applied Life Studies  > University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign  > 1207 S.

      Hello,    In the 16 Jan 2001 version of the Guidelines [1],  checkpoint 2.2 reads:        2.2 For a presentation that requires user input within           a specified time interval controlled by the user agent,           allow the user to configure the user agent to pause          the presentation automatically and await user input           before proceeding.    I am working on an action item with Eric to improve   the definition of "presentation". In reviewing checkpoint  2.2, I had the following ideas.    1) I feel like checkpoint 2.2 may be unnecessarily     bound to the term "presentation":     - We don't have a rock-solid definition of "presentation"     Right now, the definition suggests synchronized multimedia.     - I believe that this checkpoint covers more than just     synchronized multimedia presentations.    2) Checkpoint 2.2 is clearly about content that depends  on time. This implies that that there may be different   user interactions possible over the course of time, and  the checkpoint should be sure to allow that (notably  for consistency with checkpoint 2.5 to respect synchronization  cues). A user agent should not satisfy checkpoint 2.2 by  removing all time-dependencies; it should only satisfy  checkpoint 2.2 by pausing when user input is required and  resuming thereafter. Thus, content might evolve for one minute,   then pause indefinitely for user interaction, then resume  another minute, then pause indefinitely, etc.    Please consider this rewrite (that includes a couple   of other simplifications as well) to take into account  these two points:    <NEW>  2.2 For content that requires user input within a   time interval controlled by the user agent, allow  configuration to make the time interval "infinite"  (i.e., pause automatically at the beginning of each   time interval where user input is required,  and resume automatically at the completion of user  input).  </NEW>     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010116/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Nuts.    It's really really hard to predefine categories.

      Reference Document     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/    Hello,    In looking at the section on conformance [1] in the 9 July  draft, I see the following sentences:    > In order to conform as a desktop graphical user agent,   > the user agent must do all of the following:    >   1.Satisfy all the Priority 1 checkpoints listed  >     in this document that apply to that class of   >     user agent, and     >   2.Satisfy those checkpoints natively unless the   >     checkpoint explicitly indicates that it may be  >     satisfied through communication with other software.     We make use of point 1 by distinguishing desktop graphical  user agents from dependent user agents in some checkpoints.    However, I don't see any checkpoints where we say that  conformance is possible by communication with other software.    I propose that we discuss point 2. at the next teleconference  and consider dropping it. I suspect that it's role has  been subsumed by point 1. in practice.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/#conformance      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

Meanwhile, issue 449 is to create an executive summary  of UAAG 1.0. I think that we should resolve this issue  by adding an executive summary as an appendix to the  document. I started writing one, but have been absorbed  by other work.

I keeps getting an error when I try to print. Just thought you should know. It is really the only format I am interested in.    Paul,    Check out entry 2 on the 'errata' page [1]. Depending  on which version of Acrobat you are using to print (and  I'm going to assume you are using Acrobat in Windows), Acrobat  has some problems with this document, even though the document  is valid PDF. You can try to print the Postscript version as well.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA#entry-2      > Paul Houser, MCSE  > Internet/Intranet Support  > Kansas Department of Transportation  > 785.296.8411  > phouser@ksdot.org  >     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I guess what's need here is "or through an API". I believe we've  been working under the assumption that, for example, text messages  on the screen suffice since they can be picked up by assistive  technologies.

I'm not sure you're referring to 2.7, which reads  "When no text equivalent has been specified, indicate what   type of object is present."    Checkpoint 2.8 reads "When alternative text has been   specified explicitly as empty (i.e., an empty string),   render nothing."    But 2.8 uses "i.e." not "e.g.", so I don't think it suggests  more than one possibility.     > GV#12 -----------------------------  > Guideline 3 and 6   (and also a bit on 5, 9 and 10)  >   > Up to here (and for most guidelines that follow) you have a very nice  > consistent style for presenting the guidelines.  > First - you have a short phrase like title for the guideline (in a box)  > Second - you have a bold sentence - which I take to be the real guideline.  > Third - you have non bold text providing background  >   > In guideline 3 (and 6 ) however you change this format  > The title (in the box) of Guideline 3 looks like a Guideline.

The checkpoint  doesn't go so far as to say "don't change anything", it conveys  the notion of consistency. Furthermore, the second sentence indicates  explicitly where flexibility may be applied: Consistency is less   important than accessibility and adoption of operating   system conventions.      > GV#26 -----------------------------  > 9.3    Is use of the RETURN key included in what we mean here?

I don't believe that synchronization is a minimum requirement. I think  it's  an important technique for facilitating navigation between related  views.  But I for the reasons listed, I don't think that all related views  should be   synchronized. I don't think that we can just say "allow the user  to synchronize related views" because we don't know what the semantics  of  those views will be (we don't require any but the outline view) and  there  are other unknowns about what synchronization would mean in some cases.      - Ian     > Jon Gunderson wrote:  > >  > > Based on Ian's analysis [1] of the problems of including a synchronization  > > checkpoint I recommend that we reverse our decision to include a checkpoint  > > on synchronization.

I think that I agree with Eric's assessment about the  relationship between 2.5/2.6 and WCAG 1.1. I am not sure about adding  "recognized" in front of "non-text content" since we would end up  saying "recognized video" or "recognized captions" everywhere. This, to  me, is still an editorial issue: include "recognized" in every  checkpoint,  or factor it out? I am favorable to stating once in the applicability  section (which means we could/should remove "recognize" from each  checkpoint's  text).     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    In the 14 October draft [1], G4 reads:      "Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content"    I propose changing this to:      "Provide ways to check for and correct inaccessible content"    A couple of reasons:   - I don't like "methods" here. Method implies for me some methodology.     I believe what is meant here is "service" or "tool" or "feature" or     something similar. I propose "way" since it's a little less specific     than "service".   - I think "check" should be "check for" anyway.   - None of the other guidelines use gerunds (not important, but still)    - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19991014    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Why not Word then (no!)    A lot of people ask for PDF. We do have to draw the line somewhere  (e.g., we don't provide a stuffit archive). Arnaud and I thought  PDF and PS was enough and I haven't changed this list since then.     > Use "important", the defined term, not critical (or add critical in  > the index definition)    Agreed.     I have a separate problem with defining the word "important". It already  has a meaning in English.

I'd rather not affirm that.    Proposed:    "When you embed an object in a document that has its "own interface"  (i.e, it may not be controlled by the user agent), you must consider and  ensure the accessibility of that interface (e.g., device-independent  access to functionality, keyboard operability, self-voicing, etc.)  If  the interface of the embedded object cannot be made accessible, an  alternative accessible solution must be provided."     > >   1.

Hi Bertilo,    We tried very hard to use CSS floats instead of a table, but  the behavior across browsers was inconsistent and in some cases  made the content inaccessible. Had the results been different  across browsers but acceptable, we probably would have gone with  floats.    You are right, the data isn't tabular and we're using a table  for layout. However, we made sure that the results made  sense when "linearized" (e.g., when used with Lynx).     > If the window is made less wide than the logo plus the menu column,  > the menu disappears from view.

We tried that design as well, then changed it to the current  form in order to save a little space.

      Hello,    I've published a new draft of the User Agent Guidelines, available  at [1]. The techniques document that goes with it is at [2].     The techniques document is largely empty today. Please bring your  ideas about fleshing it out to the face-to-face meeting in Minneapolis.    It is difficult to summarize the changes in this draft of the  guidelines since there have been many. I recommend that people  review the entire guidelines document to verify whether changes  they requested were made. If not, please inform the editors.    Aside from general editing, some of the main changes include:    - Section 2: General principles of accessible design. The number    of principles in this section has been reduced to 6 in the hopes    of making them weightier.    - Section 3: Terms and definitions. There is language that    the definitions are meant to make the guidelines useful, but    not more than that. The definitions have been tightened up.    "Point of regard" has been added, but it is not fully defined    yet (it may come from one of insertion point, user selection, or  focus).    - The guidelines now have more rationale/background information    - The techniques are now written with a consistent voice.     - Each technique links to its "expansion" in the techniques document.    As noted above, not many of the techniques are discussed more fully    in the current release.    - There are techniques for scripts in 5.2 and 6.5    - In this release, the Postscript, PDF, and text versions of     both the guidelines and techniques documents are available (from links  at the            beginning of each document).    All comments are encouraged.      - Ian and Jon    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981019/  [2]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981019/wai-useragent-tech  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I don't find it jolting to  say "a text equivalent for the image" and "equivalent text  for the image" in the same document. It's perhaps slightly better  to use the term consistently, but I don't think it causes confusion.

I remember your reticence about this in the WCAG 1.0 discussions, but  as I recall, the WG decided to go ahead with the expression.

      Hello,    Checkpoints 4.13 and 4.14 of "Determining Conformance to the   User Agent Guidelines 1.0" are:     Checkpoint 4.13  Allow the user to configure how the selection                     is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background                     color).      Checkpoint 4.14  Allow the user to configure how the content focus is                     highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).     I propose for both of these the following requirements:    1) The UA must allow for at least one highlight mechanism that doesn't     rely on color alone.    2) The UA should follow applicable system conventions for selection     and focus rendering.    3) The UA may satisfy this checkpoint by implementing the CSS     ':focus' pseudo-element.

      Hello,    The Amaya FAQ [1] says:      "Amaya cannot be used to check documents validity. It accepts      valid and invalid documents and tries to dynamically correct     detected errors. For example it's able to add missing end-tags     and to move misplaced elements."    [Question: What is the relationship between that correction   and tidy's [2] functionality/heuristics?]    I downloaded the W3C home page, whose DOCTYPE is     <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">    and edited it in emacs, removing one ending </li>. Amaya   was not able to correct the error (it just assumed I meant  to continue the <li> and it choked much later on). Tidy  did the right thing. I think that if tidy can be shown to  do the right thing in most cases, that it should be integrated  into Amaya.     - Ian    P.S. I'm sorry if this has already been discussed.

IJ:   My understanding has been that information conveyed through style sheets  (or their markup equivalents) is intended for a particular rendering  only and is "disposable" with respect to other renderings. Of course,  we require that the raw style sheet be available to the user (as part  of all content). Refer to our discussion about the "W3C Working Draft"  background image and lack of alt text from 1999.  (Question from Ian [1], Responses from Al [2], [3], [4])     [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0202.html   [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0203.html   [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0204.html   [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0205.html     We ask user agents to allow users to turn off background images because   they can get in the way. However, we don't require more control   than that (e.g., the ability to inspect the image as Lynx provides)  since  background images are disposable and don't require additional control.  Of course, it's possible to abuse style sheets; the author could insert  the entire document with the 'content' property. But this is an  authoring  problem, and I don't know whether we should make additional requirements  on user agents based on bad authoring practices.    > Compare the "image links" function in Lynx where all IMG references are  > turned into links so that the image can be inspected, i.e. displayed  > separately from the page context.  >   > The reason I say the exception doesn't save the User Agent builder much of  > anything is that the difficulty of providing controls over the play of the  > sound is associated with the type, not the role, of the sound.

IJ:   That is the part that I don't agree with. Do users need to rewind  or slow down sounds that are used purely for decoration?     Are authors required to provide a text transcript for background sounds   that have words? We have said that authors are not required to provide  alt text for list bullets because they are graphical decoration for  structure encoded in markup (refer to discussion on the WCAG   list from Nir in 1999 [5]). I think that we should require user  agents to provide adequate control over content rendering, but I think  we don't need to require maximum control over content whose role  is only decorative.    [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0077.html    On a related note: Should we require user agents to allow users to  rewind and slow down beeps or other short sounds (even "You've got  mail")?  Those sounds may be part of the native user interface or part of  content.  These sounds have a function: convey a message about an event. We  require  that these messages be made available as text in the user interface  (checkpoint 1.5). Are we also requiring stop, start, pause, rewind,  advance, and slow down of this audio? If not, why not? In this case,  the information is not purely decorative.     The fact that some piece of audio content has a text equivalent doesn't  mean that the user agent shouldn't provide control over the audio. Thus,  I'm not arguing that as soon as an auditory track has an associated   text transcript, additional control is not required. But I don't think  users need to be able to rewind beeps.     Refer to comments from Eric Hansen about "short sounds" not being  part of audio presentations ([6], [7]).

If it's an authoring problem (i.e., encoding non-decorative  information in style) then I don't see why the user agent developers  should have to implement more control.     > Besides, I don't think we need to answer _how_ to tell which sound roles  > are considered to be decorative, because I don't myself believe we should  > make the exception in the first place.

What about the ability to inspect background images separately? That  is not currently required by the UA Guidelines. Except that checkpoint  2.1 requires access to all content. We do not have a requirement that  the user be able to navigate to and inspect all referenced content.

And then:    > I hope that someone can come up with some simpler wording which conveys the  > idea.    I hope so too.    Just a word of background. One reason this checkpoint is here is  to address access to table cell content on a cell-by-cell basis.  Users should be able to select an element according to the   document tree and ask a dependent user agent to render it.  I believe that the first goal of this checkpoint  was fine-grain control over structured access to content  (to avoid, for example, problems exhibited by  some older screen readers for multi-columns or side-by-side  table cells).    However, structured access is just one technique.  Unstructured selection may also be desirable (e.g., text not  strictly within a single element). The dependent user agent should  still be able to render that selected content.     More questions: Should the user only be allowed to select rendered   content, wherever that content coments from? Or should  the user also be able to select an element and ask for  attribute values that haven't been rendered but are human readable?  This could be very useful (to all users, actually),   but I think it would not be obvious when combined  with unstructured selection (which element do you mean if  your selection spans two partially?).    In my opinion discussion of structured and unstructured   selection, presentation of attribute values, etc. belongs  in the techniques document. The underlying requirement is   that the user be able to select some part of the document (in a   device-independent manner!) and ask a dependent user   agent to render it.    So, if "Ensure that the user has access to the   content of an element selected by the user." is unclear,  let's simplify to:      "Allow the user to select a portion of the document     for rendering (e.g., a particular element, part of     an element, human-readable attribute value, etc.)"    Then, in a more elaborate note after the checkpoint:      "For instance, allow the user to identify      a table cell with the selection and render the      cell's content and (optionally) associated header      information. Or, allow the user to select part of     a paragraph for rendering. Or allow the user to      select an element and request that the value      of an attribute known to promote accessibility      be rendered."      - Ian        --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hi Greg,    Thanks for the thorough review. I have a couple of requests:    a) Please indicate whether we can consider substantial comments     during, rather than before, last call review.    b) Please indicate any strong objections you have that you wish     us to carry forward on the Recommendation track. You may      want to wait until the WG has had a chance to evaluate your     comments.    Note that we have instituted an issues list [1] for things to do after  UAAG 1.0. We will add to that list any proposals or ideas that we do  not address in this version of UAAG.       [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-new.html    Thank you,     - Ian    Reference document:      http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010323/.    ------------------------------------------  My replies to your comments (labeled "GL")  ------------------------------------------    Note: Sorry folks, this email is pretty long. I suggest  that we break issues into smaller emails for subsequent  discussion.    I've split my comments (labeled "IJ2") into five sections:    1) Substantive new issues / new information / proposals  2) Editorial new issues / new information / proposals  3) Substantive disagreement with no new information  4) Editorial disagreement with no new information  5) Agreement    Here's why:    a) I think that we should fix editorial comments to the extent     possible before we go to last call.    b) I don't think we should spend more time discussing issues     where there is no new information, and you should register     an objection where you feel strongly.     c) For new issues, we should either try to address quickly or move to     the "future stuff" issues list. Similarly, for new information about     old issues, we should see whether we want to discuss further. If we     don't, you should register an objection where you feel strongly.    My proposals are indicated by "IJ-proposal"    ====================================================  Substantive new issues / new information / proposals  ====================================================    ---------------  Issue 393 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 1.2: Change to P2 for exposing  through other programmatic means.    <IJ>     This requirement was folded into a new checkpoint:        "6.6 Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the      operating environment). Where these APIs do not enable the      user agent to satisfy the requirements of this document, use      the standard input and output APIs of the operating      environment." [Priority 1]      Thus, while the priority of implementing standard i/o APIs was    not changed to Priority 1, the Working Group agreed that it was    more important to first use available accessibility APIs (which    are higher level than the i/o APIs) and to only use the i/o APIs    in failure mode.  </IJ>    <GL>  This is much better. However, if the platform does not let AT monitor  standard I/O APIs, then using these I/O APIs should not cause the UA to  conform with this checkpoint. I would recommend adding a third sentence,  as follows:     <GL 6.6>     "Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the operating     environment). Where these APIs do not enable the user agent to     satisfy the requirements of this document, use the standard input     and output APIs of the operating environment. Where these APIs do     not enable the user agent to satisfy the requirements of this     document, provide UA-specific APIs that meet these requirements."  </GL 6.6>  </GL>    <IJ2>  I support your proposal.    I think your intention is currently covered by 6.6 in conjunction with  6.4:       6.4 Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent user     interface controls. [Priority 1] User agent only.           Note: Per checkpoint 6.6, provide programmatic access through         standard APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs such as the W3C         DOM; standard APIs defined for a specific operating system; and         conventions for programming languages, plug-ins, virtual         machine environments, etc.). This checkpoint requires user         agents to provide programmatic access even in the absence of a         standard API for doing so.    IJ-proposal: However, I would like to adopt your proposal for the  following reason: I think the cascade:       * Standard accessibility API     * Standard device API     * Some (non-standard) API    should apply to other checkpoints than 6.4. We last modified  checkpoint 6.4 as a result of issue 457[1] in order to clarify that  even when a standard API didn't exist, communication through an API  was required.    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#457    However, the following checkpoints also include the phrase "using  standard APIs" and it's not clear whether access is required even  where standard APIs don't exist:       6.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide     programmatic access to content using standard APIs (e.g.,     platform-independent APIs and standard APIs for the operating     environment).       6.5 Using standard APIs, provide programmatic alert of changes to     content, user interface controls, selection, content focus, and     user interface focus.    Does the WG agree that these functionalities should also be  provided, even in the absence of a standard API? If so, then  it makes sense to adopt Greg's proposal and to factor out the  "standard API" part out of 6.3 and 6.5.    The difference between 6.3/6.4/6.5 and 6.6 is "standard API" versus  "standard accessibility API". Is that a substantial difference?    Note that checkpoint 6.7 "trumps" 6.6 because it always requires  standard APIs for the keyboard.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 414 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 7.3: Need stronger min  requirements    <IJ>    There has been no increase in the minimal navigation    requirements for what is now checkpoint 9.2:        "9.2 Allow the user to move the content focus to any enabled      element in the viewport. If the author has not specified a      navigation order, allow at least forward sequential      navigation to each element, in document order. The user agent      may also include disabled elements in the navigation order."      One reason that there has not been an increase is that there    are other navigation requirements in the document (search,    structured navigation). Thus, this checkpoint alone does not    guarantee simple access (but it does meet the definition of a    P1 checkpoint), but we anticipate that access will be possible    by the sum of the navigation requirements.      Please feel free to suggest alternative minimal requirements.  </IJ>    <GL>  Your point is well taken, that search and structural navigation are  covered under a separate checkpoint (9.9). However, those are only Pri  2. I would argue that reasonable keyboard access to enabled elements is  a baseline requirement for accessibility, and single-direction,  sequential navigation alone would not satisfy that. I would not want a  UA to earn single-A compliance with only this level of keyboard  navigation.   </GL>    <IJ2> As you note below, checkpoints 9.2 and 9.3 (move focus to enable  element, activate) are both P1.    </IJ2>    <GL>  I consider the ability to move backwards, or the ability to undo the  last navigation, to be considerable help in reducing the amount of work  required to recover from navigating past your intended destination. For  example, take the case where you want to activate the last link in a  list. In a UA that only supports forward navigation between active  elements using the TAB key, you press TAB repeatedly hearing the items  in the list, but you cannot tell that you're at the last one until you  press TAB and hear something clearly outside the list. To continue, you  must back up one link. Without the ability to navigate in reverse order  or undo a navigation command, the user would have to cycle all the way  through the document, which could require over a hundred commands.   </GL>    I note that the requirement to support structural navigation (9.9) does  require both forward and backward directions. Therefore, I would  conclude that either (a) you should add backwards navigation to 9.2, or  else (b) consider 9.2 just a special case of 9.9, by explicitly  mentioning enabled elements as important structural elements, or (c)  increase 9.9 from Pri 2 to Pri 1.  </GL>    <IJ2>  In the past, the WG has not agreed to adding reverse navigation  as a minimal requirement for checkpoint 9.2. Perhaps in light  of your discussion, the WG will want to reconsider or reconfirm  that decision.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 418 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 7.5: Search should include alt  text.    <IJ>    The Working Group felt that any rendered content    should be part of the search, but undrendered content should    not since this would be disorienting to the user. Instead, other    requirements of the document require access to all content, and    when rendered, that content is subject to the search    requirement.  </IJ>    <GL>  I disagree: I think it is equally disorienting to be able to see text on  the screen and yet not find it with search just because, unbeknownst to  you, it's represented by an image of text. However, I can live with it.  But maybe make it a lower priority recommendation to provide an option  to search non-rendered equivalents?  </GL>    <IJ2>  Our search requirement is on text characters only, not images  that display text. Therefore, the search requirement wouldn't  find the image in question. I would oppose adding a non-text-based  search at this time. I would also oppose   adding a requiremen to search on unrendered content at this  time, not only because we already agreed not to, but because I  don't think we have any experience with this.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 426 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 9.8: Clarify that brief  sequences satisfy this checkpoint    <IJ>    This is now checkpoint 11.4. In both the 9 March 2001    draft and the 23 October draft, this checkpoint does not make    any requirements about the complexity of bindings because those    requirements are addressed by other checkpoints. Thus, no    change was required.  </IJ>    <GL>  I don't understand the resolution: it seems clearly to describe bindings  of a single keystroke. I would recommend extending this to include brief  key sequences. It does not seem possible to allow the user to bind a  majority of the functions to single, unmodified keystrokes-there are a  very limited number of keys available for this purpose, if you don't  want to interfere with the user's ability to type in normal text.  </GL>    <IJ2>  The WG is already considering this problem as issue 468  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#468  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 429 (Second Last Call): New requirement: documentation of API for  querying preferences.    <IJ>    The Working Group did not add these requirements    today for two reasons:     - There is no known interoperable API for exchanging user     preferences. The Working Group intends to pursue this (e.g.,     with the DOM WG) after UAAG 1.0.     - The benefit to accessibility has not been studied.  </IJ>    <GL>  I disagree with this resolution on two counts. First, my major goal is  to make sure that people writing add-ons and plug-ins for specific user  agents can make them accessible. Thus, I'm not worried about the need  for API that works across multiple user agents. Second, I think my  example makes clear that without this, every add-on and plug-in will  have to provide its own means of allowing users to set configuration  parameters that affect accessibility. In many cases there will be no  convenient place to put UI for this, and in any case it will end up with  gross inconsistency between components.  </GL>    <IJ2>  You distinguish plug-in (which I presume to mean "in process")  from other types of communication. Is there a technical reason  to distinguish in-process from out of process? I think the  question of interoperability still applies (since interoperation  is still required in-process).    Do you have any examples of such an API? For instance, if  browser preferences are stored in the Windows registry, I would  consider that an instance of your request. Similarly, on   X Windows, XResources configuration files offer a configuration  standard.   </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 442 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 9.4: Does this include default  mouse click behavior?    <IJ>     Yes it does, but only if you are claiming conformance     for the pointing device.  </IJ>    <GL>  (1) OK with this since it's only priority 2. However, I have never seen  any browser allow reconfiguring of mouse input mappings. I still think  it should be priority 3, but I won't argue about it.  </GL>    <IJ2>  They may not do it, but I don't know that it's a bad idea. Suppose  that I have to do "shift-left-mouse" to accomplish something that  I would like to accomplish instead with a right click alone. That  seems useful.  </IJ2>    <GL>  (2) Why limit this only to the same input modality? In theory you should  be able to access all functionality using either mouse or keyboard.   <GL>    <IJ2>  This device-independent operation is ensured by other requirements  of the document. But for example, you might not easily remap  100 key bindings to a 3-button mouse. So we keep the reconfiguration  requirement to a per-device requirement.   </IJ2>    <GL>  In addition, mapping input to underlying functionality should be  a valid way to comply, rather than mapping one input to another input,  which is an indirect mapping to an underlying functionality. For  example, if clicking the secondary mouse button brings up a shortcut  menu for the selected object, then the user should be able to bind  that feature to a keystroke, key combination, or key sequence to bring  up that same menu for the object with the focus.   </GL>    <IJ2>  Yes, I agree. And that requirement is made by checkpoint 1.1.   </IJ2>    <GL>  (3) I do not understand why you allow the UA to refuse to remap bindings  just because they are standard for the operating environment. The  standard bindings may not be appropriate for some users, and therefore I  would recommend that the UA allow the user to override them.  </GL>    <IJ2>  If this is the case, the operating environment should let the  user remap the keys to something more useful at the operating  environment level first.  </IJ2>    ---------------  New Issue Regarding checkpoint 10.2:    <GL>  This checkpoint says "Ensure that all of the default highlight styles  for the selection, content focus, enabled elements, recently visited  links, and fee links (1) do not rely on color alone, and (2) differ from  each other, and not by color alone. [Priority 1] Both content and user  agent." I do not agree that this should be Priority 1. I believe that  nearly all checkpoints that merely describe default behavior should be  priority 2 or lower. I consider it not merely infeasible but actually  impossible to create a default configuration that satisfies every user.  Therefore we have to assume that users will be able to successfully  change the configuration. Therefore minimal standards for UA should be  to provide these options, and choosing a good default should be part  considered "beyond the minimum." The exception to this is behavior that  affects the user's ability to change the UA's configuration; therefore,  accessible behavior of the user agent's user interface can be required  as part of the minimum standard.  </GL>    <IJ2>  I find this comment very interesting! There are a few checkpoints  that make requirements for default configurations:       7.2 (P1), 10.2 (P1), 10.7 (P1), 11.5 (P2).    I think that the reason we made 10.2 and 10.7 P1 checkpoints is  that the user may not easily perceive the problem. I agree that  as long as the user can override the default, this is less  severe than the exception you cite ("by virtue of the inaccessibility  of the default configuration, the user can't make the necessary  change").    Just to make sure, can the user override the configs required in  7.2, 10.2, 10.7, and 11.5?     7.2, 11.5 (input configurations): Override possible at *P2* level                                      in checkpoint 11.3.   10.2, 10.7: (highlighting): Configuration P1 in checkpoint 10.6                               for selection/focus and *P2* in 10.3                                for fee links, etc.      So in essence, it would seem that the WG has chosen the opposite  of what you suggest: The top priority is that these mechanisms  be (reasonably) accessible by default, and that the configuration  requirement is a lower priority.     I think that the Working Group should discuss these two models.    On a side note:    IJ-proposal: The "For user agents" label is broken in checkpoint 10.6,  since the requirement pertains to selection and *content focus*. It  should be "For content only".  </IJ2>    ---------------  New Issue Regarding checkpoints 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5:.     <GL>  I am having second thoughts about requiring standard API as a Priority 1  requirement. I think that the minimum, priority 1 requirement should be  to expose this information through *any* API. If they do it through a  standard API that is even better, so I would make that Priority 2. You  may disagree, but I think it would be a positive thing for users if it  would cause some UA to expose their content through an existing native  object model, when they would otherwise not expose it at all because of   the high cost of implementing an entirely separate, standard API. It is  better to have an awkward solution than no solution at all.   </GL>    <IJ2>  This is also an interesting proposal. I think that the Working  Group has argued in the past that "some API" is not sufficient  because it makes implementation more difficult for AT developers.  The Working Group should confirm its decision.  </IJ2>      ==================================================  Editorial new issues / new information / proposals  ==================================================    ---------------  Issue 395 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 3.8: Make images optional    <IJ>    The requirement now includes a configuration for     placeholders. Please refer to checkpoint 3.7 in the 9 March draft.I  agree with this solution.  </IJ>    <GL>  However, I am not happy with the phrase "on activation" in the final  sentence, "When placeholders are rendered, allow the user to view the  original author-supplied content on activation of each placeholder." I'm  not sure what this means in practice. In the fragment, <A HREF="#a"><IMG  SRC="b.jpg"></A>, what does it mean to activate the IMG element in order  to view the associated file b.jpg?</GL>    <IJ2>  One answer to your point is to say "activation, in the case of  a placeholder, means replacement with the original content." This  is consistent with saying, for example, "activation, in the case  of an HTML A element, usually replaces the current resource with  another in the same viewport." As the definition of "activation"  says:       "The effect of activation depends on the type of enabled element or     user interface control."    IJ-proposal: However, I would not object (and would consider it  editorial) to changing the sentence to something like:       "When placeholders are rendered, allow the user to view the     original author-supplied content associated with each      placeholder."    Note also our open issue 467:    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#467  </IJ2>    <GL>  Normally one would put the focus on  the A element, and activate that, which would jump to another location.  If UA were required to provide keyboard focus not only to the link but  also to any content inside the link, it would make navigation more  cumbersome.   </GL>    <IJ2>  I don't think that's the only way one might implement this.  How do people implement longdesc today? That's another case of  two-links-in-one.  </IJ2>    <GL>  Also, the process of downloading an image should not be  linked to activating the image, should it?  </GL>    <IJ2>  I'm not sure why not. Or I'm not sure I understand your point.  </IJ2>    <GL>  This applies to other checkpoints as well.  </GL>    ---------------  Issue 399 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.7: Implementation experience  for this?    <IJ>    The Quicktime player allows positioning (but not when    captions are streamed; only when they are downloaded and    played). The RealPlayer does not (yet) support caption positioning    for SMIL, but the SMIL specification itself allows this. We are    working on getting more implementation experience/commitments.    In the meantime, the Working Group resolved to maintain this as    a P1 requirement. </IJ>    <GL>  OK.    However, in the sentence "Allow the user to choose from among the same  range of positions available to the author (e.g., the range of positions  allowed by the markup or style language)," should that read "from among  all positions available to the author" to avoid implying that the UA  must support EXACTLY the same range of positions and not a superset of  those positioned available to authors? For example, the UA should be  able to let the user move the captions to a window outside the viewport,  which may not be an option available to the content author. Perhaps this  can be clarified in a note or in the techniques document.  </GL>    <IJ2>  IJ-proposal: I agree that the wording of what is now checkpoint 4.6  could be clarified to something like:        4.6 For graphical viewports, allow the user to position text      transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions in the      viewport. Allow the user to choose from at least       the range of positions available to the author       (e.g., the range of positions allowed by the markup or style      language). [Priority 1] Content only.   </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 409 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.20: If frames are not opened,  what is result?    <IJ>     The following Note has been added to checkpoint 5.3:    "If a viewport (e.g., a frame set) contains other viewports,     these requirements only apply to the outermost container viewport."   </IJ>    <GL>  The resolution proposed is fine, but not directly responding to my  comment. Despite Ian's statement above, the checkpoint wording makes it  sounds like the UA *is* forced to suppress opening frames if the user  does not confirm the action through one means or another. My question  is, is the purpose of this checkpoint to "alert the user" when a new  frame is opening, by making them take some action in response to some  notification? Or is it to ensure that UA "allow the user to [only] open  [the viewport] on demand", which amounts to encouraging users to prevent  new frames from opening by declining some offer? If it's only the  former, there are other ways of notifying the user that are not so  intrusive, such as a standard sound. If the latter, I still wonder if  users will be very confused when the decline to let the viewport open  and then find that the content they're trying to read does not make  sense.  </GL>      <IJ2>   The requirement is actually to prevent new viewports from opening. The  accessibility issue is information overload (and possibly also  navigation complexity among viewports). "Disorientation due to sudden  changes" has been associated more with changes to focus,   so that's covered in 5.1    As to user confusion, 5.3 includes the requirement to allow the user  to open the viewport on demand, so the user should be able to go back  and get it if they decide they need it.    I would note that in the context of a synchronized presentation, where  the timing of the opening of the viewport is critical to the  presentation, then the user can break the author's intention by  suppressing the viewport creation. We are covered in this case to a  certain extent by checkpoints in Guideline 4 about controlling  presentations, but I suspect there are some scenarios we haven't yet  understood or discussed.  Nonetheless, I don't think that the current  checkpoint is therefore wrong, only that it may not address all  possible scenarios where opening viewports present problems to  users.   </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 430 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 3.2: Animations, not just  animated images     <IJ>    There are several checkpoints related to animations    in UAAG 1.0: 3.2, 3.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.7, 4.8. The Working    Group felt that the requirement of checkpoint 3.2 was about    turning off rendering of a block of content that might be     be visually disorienting, but not because of the motion; just    because of the quantity of information. Thus, checkpoint    3.2 has been limited to "video and animated images", while    checkpoints 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, and 4.8 (which are about motion) have    been broadened to include all classes of animations, as you    suggested. Furthermore, a definition of "animation" has been    added to the document to clarify what is expected.  </IJ>    <GL>  I appreciate the expanded definition of animation.     The current checkpoints allow the user to replace different types of  complex presentations with placeholders. These are split up between  checkpoints 3.2 (animated images, video, and audio), 3.3 (animated  text), and 3.7 (static images). However, three examples of "animation"  are given: sequential images, scrolling text, and displacing objects.  The first two are covered by checkpoints 3.2 and 3.3, respectively, but  where is the third type covered?   </GL>    <IJ2>  Checkpoints 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, and 4.8. The checkpoints in   Guideline 3 are really about suppressing blocks of content  that may be disorienting. For animations, we only include  specific subclasses (animated images, animated text, video).  The most general class of animation (moving ball) did not lend  itself to placeholder replacement.  </IJ2>    <GL>  Also, with regard to 3.2, I'm still not sure why "quantity of  information" is more of a problem with an animated image than with  animated text. It seems like, in many cases, they two are  indistinguishable by the user and therefore should have the same  accessibility requirements.  </GL>    <IJ2>  My understanding is that there is a difference to some users with  cognitive disabilities between visually displayed images/graphics and  visually displayed text.  Our goal is not to suppres the rendering of  all content, only images. (Thus, the requirements of 3.3 are not to  suppress rendering of text, only to stop the motion/blinking.)    </IJ2>      ---------------  Issue 432 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 3.4: Overlaps with 3.2     <IJ>    The Working Group disagrees that blinking images    and animated images are the same: blinking is an on/off effect.    There is no requirement to slow down this blinking effect (only    to stop it). There are requirements to slow down animation effects,    so that users can understand the changes to content.  </IJ>    <GL>  Actually the checkpoint to "Allow the user to configure the user agent  to render blinking images as motionless images" seems to have been  removed, making this point moot.   </GL>    <IJ2>  Yes. Sorry I missed that in my summary. We deleted that checkpoint  starting in the 26 January draft for a couple of reasons:   a) The WG was not aware of blinking images on the Web.   b) Even if they are on the Web, checkpoint 3.2 (animated images)      seems to cover the requirement sufficiently.  </IJ2>    <GL>  It might be worthwhile modifying the definition of 'placeholder' to  include the example of using the first significant frame of an animated  image as the placeholder for the animated image.  </GL>    <IJ2>  IJ-proposed: I agree with the proposal.  </IJ2>    ---------------  New Issue Regarding checkpoint 10.3:     <GL>  Instead of "The highlight mechanism must not rely on color alone," it  would be more accurate to say, "One or more highlight options must be  provided that do not rely on color alone." The current wording could be  interpreted as meaning that the user must not be allowed to select a  highlighting option which relies solely on color.   </GL>    <IJ2>  The checkpoints are written to make minimal requirements. This  checkpoint only requires one mechanism, in which case it must  not rely on color alone. The user agent may always implement  more than one mechanism. We do use the "at least" formulation  in other checkpoints. I have no objection to making the suggested  editorial change.  </IJ2>      ================================================  Substantive disagreement with no new information  ================================================    ---------------  Issue 396 (Second Last Call): New requirement: Allow user to override  absolute values    <IJ>    The Working Group resolved not to include general    resizing requirements in UAAG 1.0 (though there are    requirements for resizing text). This is now clearly listed as    one of the limitations of UAAG 1.0 (refer to section 1.3 of    the document). Some specifications (e.g., SVG) will allow for    resizing as part of conformance to those specifications.  </IJ>    <GL>  I do not believe this is necessarily difficult to solve, at least in  specific cases such as absolute sizes of elements. I consider this a  very major deficiency in the guidelines.  </GL>    <IJ2>  We did not have a technical reason for not adding this  requirement. We simply decided to stop adding requirements to  the document after a certain point (so that we would someday  finish...).  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 403 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.12: Need to require override  of author-specified speeds.    <IJ>    We did not add this requirement (for user control of    author-supplied rate changes) for the following reasons:     1) If speech engine allows user override, that's the speech     engine's functionality, not the UA's.     2) We don't require content transformations to strip out     author-supplied rate changes before sending to the speech     engine.  </IJ>    <GL>  I can live with this, but I disagree with it. As for reason #1,  certainly the UA would not be required to support speech rates outside  the range supported by the speech engine. However, they should support  the full range of rates supported by the engine. That is definitely UA  functionality. As for #2, *why* don't you require UA to strip out, or  replace, author-supplied rate changes before sending to the speech  engine when the speech rate is specified using a standard markup? This  seems easy enough to do. Are there other factors you are not mentioning?  </GL>    <IJ2>  @@  Point 1:     Point 2:  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 415 (Second Last Call): Definition of active element: too broad  (checkpoint 7.4)    <IJ>     There have been a number of changes related to the     term "active element". In fact, the term has been deleted      from the document and replaced with other terms (with clearer     entries in the glossary):         * Interactive element       * Enabled element.       Furthermore, the definition of "enabled element" states:         "For the requirements of this document, user selection does       not constitute user interaction with enabled elements."  </IJ>    <GL>  I'm still confused. The definition says "An enabled element is a piece  of content that is subject to user activation through the user interface  or indirectly through an API. The set of elements that a user agent  enables is generally derived from, but is not limited to, the set of  interactive elements defined by implemented markup languages." There are  two problems with this.     The first problem is that the first sentence defines 'enabled element'  in terms of 'activation', but the latter term is defined as "To trigger  one or more behaviors associated with an enabled element." Term 1 is  defined by referring to term 2, and term 2 is defined by referring to  term 1, and thus we have a cyclical definition.    The second problem is similar. 'Enabled elements' are said to be a  superset of 'interactive elements defined by implemented markup  languages,' but an 'interactive element' is defined as a 'piece of  content that is intended, by specification, to be an enabled element in  some user sessions.' Thus, enabled elements are said to be a superset of  all elements that are intended to be able to be enabled elements. I  guess the additional enabled elements that are not interactive elements  must be things that the UA makes enabled *against* the intentions of the  specification language. Sounds suspicious to me.  </GL>    <IJ2>   I will work to clear up the definitions.    I think the first problem can be cleared up by changing the definition  of enabled element to (something like):      "Enabled element: A piece of content with associated behaviors that    may be activated through the UI or through an API"      "Activate: To trigger the behaviors associated with either     an enabled element or a user interface control."      Note addition (and distinction) of UI control.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 435 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.14: Is this for content only  or UI as well?     <IJ>     Content only. There has been no change to the     document. However, based on my comments for issue #413, I     think additional clarification may be required.  </IJ>    <GL>  Please clarify why the user should not have control over attributes of  synthesized speech used as part of the UA's UI.  </GL>    <IJ2>  No technical reason, only that the WG chose not to  generalize our content requirements to the user interface  (I can't locate the resolution right now, but could if pressed).  Instead, we resolved to add the following to the (Techniques)  document:       "Much of the rationale behind the content requirements of User     Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 also makes sense for the user     agent user interface (e.g., allow the user to turn off any blinking     or moving user interface components)."  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 440 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 7.5: Should min reqs be moved  to techniques?    <IJ>    The Working Group believes that the details of the    required search functionality (now checkpoint 9.8) are    minimal requirements, and thus belong in the checkpoint.  </IJ>    <GL>  (1) OK to leave, although I think it is too detailed and specific.  </GL>    <IJ2>  This is the list of search requirements the WG considered "essential".  </IJ2>    <GL>  (2) Should add the option or mechanism to start search from the  beginning of the document rather than from the current selection or  focus. There is no easy way to do this in IE today. Or is there already  a requirement to provide an easy way to move the "focus" or start of  search to the beginning or end of the document.     (3) Should provide distinct alerts for the three situations listed; the  user should be able to easily tell whether they have searched all the  content, or whether they merely reached the end of the document and now  need to wrap to the beginning.    (4) There are a lot of additional variations that could be included as  priority 3. For example, should add the ability to search backwards  through content, possibly as a priority 3 checkpoint. That is part of  forgiveness, allowing the user to avoid having to start over if they  accidentally go one search too far.    (5) If the user has not indicated a start position for the search, the  search should start from the beginning of that portion in the viewport  (as far as the user agent is concerned-it does not have to deal with  whether portions of its window is obscured by other applications or  operating systems windows).    (6) Should ideally provide the option of searching through alternative  representations (such as ALT text) and source (e.g. you know the page  was found by a search engine looking for a specific term, but normal  search cannot find it, it would be nice to have it inform you that it  found the text in metadata or other non-rendered portions of the source.  This would be lower priority.  </GL>    <IJ2>  All of this should go in the Techniques document.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 441 (Second Last Call): New requirement (part of 8.5): Add  information about the resource being at the same or a different domain.      <IJ>    This was not added. However, there is a requirement    to provide information about whether the link is internal    to the same resource.  </IJ>    <GL>  I disagree with this decision but can live with it.  <GL>    <IJ2>  Ok.  </IJ2>    ==============================================  Editorial disagreement with no new information  ==============================================    ---------------  Issue 389 (Second Last Call): Conformance: Hard to test conformance in  an objective fashion.     <IJ>    We've done a lot to improve the document in terms of    conformance since the last call draft, including the following:     a) Introduction of content type labels and input modality        labels to allow greater flexibility in conformance.     b) Clarifying checkpoints (notably those of Guideline 1).       However, as you recall from our 25 January 2001 discussion [4]     you maintained your concern that the Guidelines are not      technology-specific, making it difficult to objectively measure      conformance. We will take these comments to the Director, but     for now we have left the Guidelines (and conformance scheme)     technology-independent, as was the case for WCAG 1.0 and ATAG 1.0.  </IJ>    <GL>  I am still concerned that there may be places where the Note text adds  details that apparently will be taken as a legally binding extension to  the checkpoint wording itself, and how examples given in Techniques can  confuse things by not distinguishing examples from recommendations.  However, I'll have to see if I can find an example.  </GL>    ---------------  Issue 438 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 7.3: For some devices, is  direct navigation of active elements sufficient?     <IJ>     This has been clarified because the checkpoints of     what is now Guideline 9 have been made much more specific     to the content focus (whatever input devices are used     to control the content focus). There are no requirements in     the document for direct navigation through a pointing device,     but if the user agent allows the user to move the focus with     the pointing device, the desired functionality is achieved.  </IJ>    <GL>  (1) I can live with this; I understand the reason for it, but I still  feel that you're heaping so many expectations on the UA that none will  ever conform to this level. That is to say, no UA will conform with  respect to pointing devices.    (2) Where it says "The user agent may also include disabled elements in  the navigation order," the key factor is that the user should be able to  move only to active elements. The ability to move to inactive elements  can be a user-controllable option, but should not be unalterable  behavior.   </GL>    <IJ2>  Unless I have misunderstood the comment, your requirement is  covered at a P2 level by checkpoint 9.7. Note that it was  considered a P1 requirement to get to the enabled elements  at all (with possibly other elements in between), and a P2  requirement to get to them without "interruption" by  disabled elements.  </IJ2>    =========  Agreement  =========    ---------------  Issue 392 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 1.4: Overly broad    <IJ>     This is a conformance issue: a claim of conformance    may include any number of software components. Therefore, a    user agent alone might not satisfy one of the requirements, but    the user agent in conjunction with another piece of software    (e.g., an on-screen keyboard that comes with the OS) might.    There is no longer a notion of "what is the responsibility of    the user agent, the operating system, and third-party    accessibility aids"; there are simply requirements that must    be met, by whatever means the claimant has available.  </IJ>    <GL>  The new wording is fine.     However, I'm worried about this approach whitewashing the difference  between a UA that is designed to be accessible, and one that uses  inaccessible design but has at least one dedicated third-party vendor  who creates a hack solution. I believe we owe it to customers trying to  make purchasing decisions to help clarify this, and we also owe it to  customers who want a wide range of AT products for use with their UA.   </GL>    <IJ2>  I think our conformance claim requirements will help inform  consumers. I do not have other suggestions at this time.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 398 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.5 (4.6, 4.8, 4.9): Need  definition of "not recognized as style"    <IJ>     There were two changes to the document:     a) The following statement in checkpoint 4.4 et al. is        clearer:        "The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint        for audio and animations whose recognized role is to create        a purely stylistic effect."     b) The Note of checkpoint 4.4 states:        "Note: Purely stylistic effects include background sounds,        decorative animated images, and effects caused by style        sheets. The style exception of this checkpoint is based on        the assumption that authors have satisfied the requirements        of the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10]        not to convey information through style alone (e.g.,        through color alone or style sheets alone)."  </IJ>    <GL>  Acceptable, but I'm not wholly comfortable with saying that the UA can  avoid making accessible anything that is authored in a way that is  supposed to be reserved for purely stylistic touches, because we all  know that authors abuse these mechanisms.   </GL>    <IJ2>  We have acknowledged the potential for abuse by authors, but we  explicitly excluded this repair for this checkpoint.   </IJ2>    <GL>  In many cases authors will  convey information using background sounds or sounds specified in style  sheets, and it would be to the user's benefit to be able to have access  to and control over those sounds.  </GL>    <IJ2>  (Checkpoints 4.7 and 4.8 address this at a P2 level.)  </IJ2>      ---------------  Issue 400 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.11: Why limited to sources  synchronized to play simultanously?    <IJ>    The answer is that the requirement for independent    volume control is not necessary when sources of audio may be    played one after the other. In that case, global control    suffices (another checkpoint). Thus, this is an expression of    the minimal functional requirement. We added a Note to    checkpoint 4.10:       "Note: Sounds that play at different times are distinguishable     and therefore independent control of their volumes is not part     of this checkpoint (volume control per checkpoint 4.9     suffices). The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint by     allowing the user to control independently the volumes of all     distinct audio sources. The user control required by this     checkpoint includes the ability to override author-specified     volumes for the relevant sources of audio."  </IJ>    <GL>  Acceptable.     However, note that there are at least three good reasons for strongly  recommending that all sounds are independently configurable: (1) sounds  which are not synchronized may end up playing simultaneously, and (2) if  the user cannot anticipate when a sound will play they cannot adjust the  global volume control at appropriate times to affect this sound, and (3)  it is extremely inconvenient for the user to have to frequently adjust  global volume to accommodate sounds about to be played, especially when  this leads them to frequently switch back and forth between different  volume settings. Therefore I would recommend making this a separate Pri  3 checkpoint.  </GL>    <IJ2>  What if, instead, we strengthen the Note after 4.10. Change "may"  to "should" in:        "The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint by allowing the user      to control independently the volumes of all distinct audio      sources.      I am not very much in favor of adding checkpoints at this time.  I would like to include your rationale in the Techniques document  for 4.10 in any case.  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 406 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.18: Lower to Priority 3    <IJ>    The Working Group felt that the orientation problems    were significant enough that this checkpoint (now 5.1) should    remain a priority 2 checkpoint.  </IJ>    <GL>  I disagree, but I can live with it.    However, you should then add a requirement that says the UA must notify  the user when opening or closing viewports, when that is not the direct  result of explicit user request. After all, it is worse for the UA to  open a new window and not tell the user than it is to open a window and  move focus to it.  </GL>    <IJ2>  I believe that both of those requirements are already covered in the  document:    For notification (in fact, prompting) before opening, checkpoint 5.3.  For notification (in fact, prompting) before closing, checkpoint 5.6.  (In both cases, when not on explicit user request).  </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 407 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 4.20: Include requirement to  control automatic closing of viewports    <IJ>   This is now checkpoint 5.6 (Priority 3).  </IJ>    <GL>  Fine. But is there a checkpoint that recommends UA use standard system  notification or alert mechanisms when doing things like closing  viewports?  </GL>    <IJ2>  That is covered (P2 level) by checkpoint 7.3:       7.3 Follow operating environment conventions that benefit     accessibility.    IJ-proposal: Change "that benefit accessibility" to "that do not  interfere with accessibility". [I make this proposal only for  checkpoint 7.3 and not for checkpoints in Guideline 12.]    </IJ2>    ---------------  Issue 413 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 6.2: Does this only apply to  content?    <IJ>    Yes, this applies only to content. There has been    no change to the document because it was considered that    the label in the document "Checkpoints for content" was    sufficient, but given other changes to the document    subsequently, I think this requires an additional (editorial)    clarification to the checkpoint. (I will write a proposal    to the Working Group.)  </IJ>    <GL>  I'll wait to see your proposed modifications, but I strongly favor  writing all checkpoints so that their meanings are not significantly  changed when quoted out of context. I consider relying on headings  outside the checkpoint itself to be dangerous, even if the headings are  present in every guidelines document and summary published by the W3C,  because they will be quoted out of context on occasion.  </GL>    <IJ2>  This is done as of the 23 March 2001 draft: we have labels  in each checkpoint.     IJ-proposal: I think the label for 10.2 should read "For content only"  instead of "For content and user agent". This is because the highlight  styles for selection, content focus, etc. only refer to interacting  styles within content. It is possible to have selection and focus  in the UI, but that's not what this checkpoint is intending to  address. I consider this editorial and will fix it.  </IJ2>      ---------------  Issue 424 (Second Last Call): Checkpoint 9.3: Do author-specified  shortcuts include active elements that take mouse input?     <IJ>    Bindings accomplished through scripting are not part    of the requirements of this document. This is covered by our    "applicability" provision in general. Furthermore, the    following statement has been added to section 3.2 of the    document (as an example of when one would consider applicability):       "Some input device behavior may be controlled by scripts in a      manner that the user agent cannot recognize."  </IJ>    <GL>  I disagree with this resolution. In many cases the UA knows when an  object handles different types of input events. For example, with  javascript the UA knows if the script declares a handler for onClick  events. Thus, it is entirely reasonable for it to provide keyboard  mechanisms for putting focus on and simulating mouse input to these  elements.  </GL>    <IJ2>  Actually, I think we are in agreement, but I expressed the  resolution incorrectly. Just because something is in a script  doesn't exclude it from the requirements of the document. It is  more likely that knowledge embedded in scripts will be harder  for the user agent to recognize. However, it is not impossible,  and there are many things done in scripts (e.g., opening a viewport)  where the user agent knows very well what is about to happen. The  case you site is an example of what the user agent should recognize.  Therefore, I think our document already reflects your expectation.  </IJ2>    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The HTML 4.0 intentionally does not discuss how new elements and  attributes are to be presented. The HTML WG also elected  to say very little about the semantics of "longdesc" and in   particular how the user agent should make the information available  to the user. The details were postponed, I believe until  they could be addressed by the WAI. It seems as though the  time has come and you are requesting further specifications for   the attributes and elements particularly relevant to accessibility.    In my opinion, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  is not the right forum for resolving these problems. Rather,  it is some combination of WAI Working Groups. Judy,  should this be taken to the WAI CG?     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I am not  excited about using a table for layout, believe me. Our  experiments with trying to design a page that used floats  and worked across different browsers on different platforms  failed. We debated whether we wanted to use floats and take  a stand to promote support for specifications, or to use a   table and ensure that the page linearized well   (as recommended by the Web Content Accessibility   Guidelines [1]). We chose the table as a practical, not purist  solution.     One of the reasons we created this list was to get feedback  on how to improve our design, and in particular, how to get  rid of the table. We hope that people will contribute ideas  and that this archive will allow other people to learn about  designs that "do the right thing": provide visually appealing  solutions that adhere to specifications and meet the needs  of all users.     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-table-markup      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

For which checkpoint is this a technique? How exactly would this  work?    1) If you say "Download the current page and everything it links  to recursively" you may get the whole Web on your hard drive...  You might do the following:    1) Download the current page and any linked to it via LINK  2) Download all referenced images, objects, etc. (What about     applets?)  3) Don't download resources linked by  <A href..>    2) If you spend time identifying each page you want to download     and putting the URL in a list box, doesn't that amount     to following the link as we do today?     > *    Support the resumption of partial downloads so that a time  > consuming but incomplete download is continued rather than  > restarted.    While extremely important, this feature does not seem to be   an accessibility issue and my gut feeling is that it's out  of scope for this document.    I realize that anything that saves time can benefit accessibility.  Can you suggest important reasons while resumption of a download  benefits accessibility?

I believe this is covered by checkpoint 5.5. We can either:    1) Include a special-case checkpoint.  2) Include TV's example as an important example of what 5.5 is     meant to cover.    > >Minor addition  on the section  that talks about "search" as  > >a useful navigation technique --a useful addition would be  > >to allow the user to search only certain types of constructs  > >in the document e.g. headings.

This is from the "Webopedia" definition [1] (which I don't really like,  but for this part):      "A simulation of movement created by displaying a series of     pictures, or frames."    I like the focus on the simulation of movement.    ---------  PROPOSAL  ---------    What about something like this:    <DFN>    Animation: a visual effect of simulated movement. Animation    techniques include:         * displaying a series of snapshots in a fixed graphical        region (e.g., as is done for video and animated images).        The series of snapshots may be part of a single resource        (e.g., an animated GIF image) or individual resources        (e.g., a series of images downloaded continuously by        the user agent).      * scrolling text (e.g., achieved through markup or        style sheets).      * displacing graphical objects around the viewport        (e.g., a picture of a ball that is moved around the viewport        giving the impression that it is bouncing off of the        viewport edges).  </DFN>    I remind Charles that part of the action item from the  face-to-face meeting was to explain why checkpoint 3.2  should say "video or animated images" and 4.4 should  say "video and animations". If video and animated images  are subclasses of animation, then 4.4 could just refer  to animations (it doesn't need to mention video, or if  it mentions video, I think it should also mention animated  images explicitly as in 3.2).    My question on this topic was initially this:  we have three checkpoints that refer to animated things:     - 3.2: Turn off video and animated images   - 3.3: Turn off animated text   - 4.4: Slow video and animations    I think that we should not change any of the requirements,  but instead:    a) Define animation to be a superclass that includes video,     animated images, and other motion within the viewport.    b) Change 4.4 to read "animations (including video and animated     images)"    c) For 4.4, we include the SMIL 2.0 techniques related to the     'speed' attribute (currently implemented in IE 5.5 for Windows).     - Ian                    [1] http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/a/animation.html      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hello,    It would seem that we have to decide what will bring the greater  benefit:    1) Putting Guideline 7 up front.  2) Publishing the Guidelines as a Proposed Rec as soon as posssible.    I believe that the benefit of the former option is vastly inferior to  the   benefit of the latter. I believe this because:     a) Guideline 7 is in the document, after all. We have little evidence  that     it is invisible to readers in position 7.     b) Efforts have been made in prose, in the goals, etc. to emphasize     the importance of the tool's accessibility. It will not escape the     reader's attention that the tool must be accessible.     c) A Recommendation in which compromise has been struck beats no  Recommendation.      I don't think that this particular compromise  - one of position in       a scheme where position should not matter - undermines the document  or      weakens its impact. In particular, conformance is not weakened by  the       guideline's position.      - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Your point is well-taken. The introduction has been  designed to tell authors that designing with accessibility  in mind will help them produce pages that transform  gracefully in a number of situations. The priorities, however,  reflect needs of people with disabilities. While it may be  true that a Priority 1 checkpoint such as 1.1 ("Provide  text equivalents for all images") will benefit a number  of user classes, search robots, etc. , the priority  was assigned because of accessibility needs.     > As another example, when requiring captioning  > to assist audio streams, I am missing a guideline  > on the language of that captioning.

Can you explain what you mean by a "guideline  on the language of the captioning"? Do you mean  that the caption's natural language should be identified?  Although 6.2 comes close to covering   this ("Identify the primary (natural) language of a document."),   perhaps we need to add a checkpoint about identifying the natural  language of alternative content. There is also an "hreflang" attribute  in HTML for identifying the language of the target of a link.  Should that be included?     > As a final example, I would rate guideline 5.4  > (use style sheets to control layout and presentation)  > as Priority 1, when not considered in the context  > of access improvement for disabled.    > I am not stating the guidelines are not beneficial  > to the wider area, but I would suggest to restrict  > the scope of the Guidelines to access by disabled people  > more clearly (the Abstract does mention this).  > I expect doing this will help the understanding of  > the document and its use.    ok.     > Some minor things:  >   > - I found the section indexing "A", "B", "C" confusing.  >   I would number the sections and call the first appendix "A".

Such use counters the rating by Priority index.  >   For example,  >   - "important" in guideline 2.1  >   - "if needed" in guideline 2.2  >   - "properly" in guideline 5.1    While I agree with you that we should avoid subject language,  the Working Group chose the wording for some checkpoints very  carefully. For example, checkpoint 2.1 uses the word "important"  intentionally (and links to its definition in the glossary). Not  every image needs a long description. We must rely on the user's  judgement to determine that an image (or applet, etc.) is important  enough that it deserves one.    As for "if needed" and "where possible", I agree that these  should be reviewed and deleted ... "where possible".    The term "properly" in 5.1 needs elaboration. The WG should  address, for example, whether a jump from an H2 to and H4 is  considered "properly nested" or whether such a jump  is permissible. (As opposed, for example, to an H3 preceding  and H2 when logically the first follows the second.)     > - I would rate longdescs as Priority 2, assuming that  >   that will encourage the use of 'title' and 'alt'.  >   I mean, I fear a risk, otherwise the guidelines are not  >   adhered and none of these get implemented.  >   Alternatively, the cases were longdesc is Priority 1  >   could be made more specific.    I think the Priority 1 is "tempered" by the notion of important.  The Working Group might consider lowering the Priority explicitly  for less important cases, as it did for checkpoint 10.1, which reads:      [Priority 1 if information or functionality is important and not    presented elsewhere, otherwise Priority 2.]      > - checkpoint 4.1:  >   I agree with this one, but I like to mention that sometimes  >   color can enhance the message, but is acceptable when lost,  >   eg. upon printing (recall, that in such cases the device  >   can opt for other solutions to present the information).    Please explain how you would change the wording of the checkpoint:       Ensure that all information conveyed with color is      also available without color, for example from context or markup.     > - checkpoint 5.1:  >   I was confused by the wording "nest".

Action DB: Schedule time with IE team for next tuesday when         CMN will be in Seattle to review the CR if ready.       KB: What if all developers say "We don't expect to satisfy         these 5 or they shouldn't be on the list?"       IJ: Valuable information that should be considered by the WG.       2.Face to face planning update          JG: We have an invitation from RFBD (Princeton, NJ).            PWWorks may be "co-host".         No objections to general location (east coast).       3.Updated working draft of the guidelines and techniques published on  15       January          IJ:         - new short names         - some new text in there awaiting WG approval.      13.WD#186: Proposed removal of Note in 2.1       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#186          HB: I think "concurrent" is better than "simultaneous".         Resolved: Approved.         Action IJ: Make change for 2.1 note.      14.WD#187: Proposed change in wording to 1.6 (profiles)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#187            IJ: Note the change - no longer required only on systems           with multiple users.         HB: Reword to be "through a profile".         Resolved: Approved.         Action IJ: Make change with clarification.      16.WD#189: Proposed change to checkpoint 2.3 (missing alt info)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#189          KB: Required by "whom"?              IJ: The markup language definition, not WCAG.         Resolved: Approved.             Action IJ: Make change wtih clarification.       4.WD#185: clarification of "single key" access        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#185          Refer to DB's proposal:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0099.html         DB: Sticky keys on means that you accomplish something with           single keys in sequence.         JB: I think we want to highlight that you want really single           key, direct access (e.g., "F4" and that's it). I think           people want to highlight the ability to do this, but           not make it an absolute requirement.         DB: I don't think you'll get developers to add single-key           when sticky keys and sequences exist.         DP: I think the objective is to perform a single action with           a single key.         KB: In IE, you can get to most of the functions, but can be           very inefficient for some users. The goal (according to           Bryan Campbell) is to let users configure a small number           of single key bindings for important actions. Sequences           ok for the rest.         DB: I think that this is less important than other accessibility           features. I can, with sticky keys today, do some things           faster than some users with a mouse.         JG: Refer to Alan Cantor's email about keyboard efficiency           as well.            http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0098.html         Consensus:             We don't expect all functionalities to be bound to single          keys at the same time.         IJ: Also, I think there are some contexts where you are           inherently doing N things (e.g., the print control panel).           I only mean "things that only require one step".         DP: Save input configurations in the user's profile.         JG: Note that this is possible in Word. We're asking for the           functionality in user agents.         GR: Note that Opera is a user agent that recognizes different           modes, so that in form edit mode, single key strokes aren't           available to the user.         IJ: noted - there may be modes in which some single keys           are not available (e.g., "p" should not be available           in editing mode).         Proposed:          - Split 10.3 into two. Make single-key a special case of old            10.3.         Action Ian: Propose split to list. Priority 2 for new checkpoint.                   Incorporate these pieces:                      - Not all at once                      - Some keys not available at certain times.                      - Intended for one-step operations.       5.LC#142: Checkpoint 1.5 (output device-independence) needs  clarification.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#142          Refer to proposal from DP:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0122.html         DP: Goal of not having my input be sent to the wrong window.       GR: I would like to talk to RS face-to-face about some of the           focus issues.       JG: I have problems with "all output device APIs". Which ones?           The printer?         JG: I think the goal is that messages are rendered through           system controls.         IJ: I think the actual requirement is device-independent access           to information. System controls are the best way to do this           since ATs can monitor them.         IJ: I think 1.5 may be covered by 5.2, 9.1, and 5.6. However,           1.5 is P1.          JG: Problem of support for beeps: is morse code necessary?            DP: Refer to 9 December minutes as well.         Proposed:           - Modify 9.1 to include controls         - Add checkpoint to G4 to includes messages. In techniques           talk about different priorities of messages.         - Modify 1.5 about mode-independence of messages.           (Don't just use sound or animations).        Action IJ: Propose changes to the list.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    In [1], checkpoint 5.11 reads:        Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned       windows. [Priority 1]     In SYMM Working Group teleconference, we discussed  the meaning of this checkpoint. There are many instances  where opening a window is vital to the functioning of the  page (e.g., when, from a SMIL presentation, one opens  an HTML media object in a new window. Note that SMIL  players do not currently render HTML themselves.).     I believe the intent of the checkpoint is to prevent  disorienting changes to view, selection, or focus,  a goal covered by checkpoint 10.1:       Provide information about document and view changes      (to the user and through programming interfaces).    Note: I propose adding the words "focus" and "selection"   explicitly to 10.1.    While turning off spawning of windows may be one solution  to avoiding disorienting changes in views, I don't think  it's an effective solution since so much functionality  may be lost. Instead, in the techniques, we should tell  user agents how to inform users of changes to the view.  For instance, by emitting an audio cue, by speaking  "title" text of the linked resource along with some  warning, etc.     I propose deleting checkpoint 5.11 and ensuring that the  goal of not disorienting users is clearly stated in 10.1.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990809   --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hello,    The WAI Team discussed Triple-A Conformance of some pages and documents  including WCAG 1.0. Checkpoint 14.2 reads:       14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory           presentations where they will facilitate          comprehension of the page. [Priority 3]     This seems to mean that an all-text document (or one with  text almost exclusively such as the GL home page or the  WCAG 1.0) cannot conform at Level Triple-A.     I think we discuss this issue at a teleconference.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

I would argue the following:    1) The subject of a claim may have many components (in fact, is likely     to have more than one component).    2) Some checkpoints may not be relevant to some of the components.     For instance, a component of the user agent that implements     a search algorithm but has no user interface and does not maintain     state in the form of a document object would not be affected by     user interface or DOM requirements. However, if that functionality     is available to the user, then it needs to be documented, so      Guideline 11 applies.    3) The subject as a whole must satisfy the requirements of the     document. The subject must export the DOM for access to the     document object, whichever component or components contribute     to that document object.      - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I agree that it's important to be flexible, but imprecise language  should be avoided. The word "nature" to me, implies something that  cannot be changed by the user - something's nature is inherent  to it (e.g., human nature).     Actually, I don't think alerts have severity - errors have severity.  Alerts just let you know what the severity is.    Proposed:     "Allow the users to control the timing and presentation of alerts."    - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hi Mark,    I argued earlier on this thread the Guideline 12 has three types  of requirements: what must be documented (12.2, 12.3, and 12.5),  organization of the documentation (12.4), and accessibility of  the documentation (12.1).    You wrote:     > MN:  sorry, i don't agree.

IJ: I still don't understand how 12.3 is a special case of  12.1. Checkpoint 12.1 says conform to WCAG 1.0, which says  nothing about what needs to be documented for a user agent  that conforms to UAAG 1.0.    > also , if you added the wording "for each software release"  > into 12.1, which is really what you want, then checkpoint 12.5  > is not needed.    The WG resolved at the 19 April 2001 teleconference to  adopt this proposal to address the issue about 12.5 referring  to more than one release:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0034    > looking at checkpoint 12.5 from a totally backwards point of  > view, I could develop a new UA version 1.0, and by performing  > 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 comply or....

See my  > point?  There is nothing in 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 about each  > release.      [Editorial]    IJ: I think that if we change "product documentation" in 12.1 to  "user agent documentation" then we will be covered. The  conformance section binds the term "user agent" in the  checkpoints to the subject of the claim. And therefore, old  documentation (of previous versions) would not satisfy the  requirements.    > I of course assume it is implied, ouch!  Would it not  > be easier to add that wording to 12.1, and get rid of 12.5?

[Editorial]    IJ: The difference (which I will try to clarify in the document)  is that it's a P1 to describe accessibility features *somewhere*  in the user agent documentation. It's a P2 that those features be  documented in a (dedicated) single section (possibly in addition  to being distributed throughout the documentation).    > another problem i have with 12.2 and 12.4, is exactly what or  > exactly who is going to determine what features benefit  > accessibilty and thus require documentation as such.  > accessibility added to web documents under w3c development may be  > easy to define, others as part of the UI or UA experience on a  > particular platform are much more ambiguous.    Please refer to my proposal [1] to clarify in Guideline 12 which  features that benefit accessibility must be documented. This is  proposal 21b (not yet reviewed during a teleconference).

RS: This is a complex document. Few UAs will conform when the  document     becomes a Recommendation. If there are really sticky issues, we  should     push them off to the next version       AG: A guidelines document is somewhat different from a lower-level     technical specification. It's not clear that W3C understands how to     handle guidelines entirely. I think it's ok to have some checkpoints     be future-looking.       DA: We need to remember that this document is to promote     accessibility, and we shouldn't sacrifice accessibility in order to     get the document out faster.       JG: If we know about a problem but don't have solutions, we may want     (in another document) to spend time in CR to get developer input.       MQ: It is possible to note in the document which issues are important     but not entirely implemented yet.    Issues      [3]Issue 321 Equivalency relationships and the wording of checkpoint  2.3          [3]  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#321       Refer to [4]email from Al on bindings.          [4]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0312.html       JG: I think there are two things going on in parallel      1. WCAG says to create, ATAG says help people create them, UAAG says         make them available      2. Hierarchical definition track and use of precise language.       DP: Ascii art as braille is not very helpful       EH: WCAG requires text equivalents for non-text content. But  generally     speaking, an equivalency target doesn't have to be accessible.       AG:      1. It is critical that user agents implement the format. Talking         about author's intent is problematic (and how to capture it in  the         format). We want the user agent to inspect the markup and to  offer         substitutes. But the user agent needs to give the user the         ultimate choice.      2. I think we are in agreement on requirements, but not language.         There are some cases where polarity is clear (e.g., IMG/alt). But         in the discussion of equivalence, we are also addressing the case         (e.g., SMIL), where the "ruling" case is not clear.       JG: I think in PF they are moving away from specific markup to more     general solutions that also benefit accessibility.       EH: I think that some requirements such as making all alternatives     available (including those that don't have clear accessibility     imlications such as alternative languages) fall under checkpoint 2.1.     I think that the definition of equivalency is an assertion about     accessibility of pairs of content.       RS: I think the bottom line is text equvalents.       AG: Because of cases like smil, where the accessibility impact may  not     be in the markup, if you don't capture the general case in the UAAG,     you miss the special case of accessibility. I think that alternative     languages is an accessibility requirement.       EH: Refer to my comments to the SYMM WG (Member-only?) about needing     additional markup to identify accessibility content explicitly. If  the     markup is insufficient, you can't have rationale support for     accessibility.       AG: I think that you should make the link to accessibility not in the     definitions but in the checkpoints or at the guideline level.       EH: If you unbind the terms from the accessibility implication, the     WCAG definition of non-text element falls apart. It doesn't handle,     e.g., ascii art and scripts. These consist of text characters but are     "non-text elements". So if you define text element as only being     composed of text characters, you break the WCAG definition. If you  are     willing to tinker with WCAG language, you can shift the accessibility     criterion to other definitions or spell it out in the checkpoint.       AG: Fuzzy definition not a big problem for WCAG because they are     speaking to the human author. If there were something that the UA had     to do automatically in software, we would have a problem since the     definition is not good enough. But we don't have that problem for     alternatives.       IJ: But we do for 1.5, for example.       AG: But then you can talk to authors again (the UA doesn't have to do     anything).       RS: We need to be able to have access to the equivalent so that we  can     render it in other modes. In the UAAG, we have no control over what     the author did. I think we should refer to WCAG and address the     problems there.       DA: I think our problem here is that we are talking about things with     linguistic content.       EH: Another way of talking about text elements is that it has a     quality of "rendering independence". The trimodal approach is not     totally open, not total independence.       AG: I think the improvements that we're talking about are good and     should be in WCAG 2.0. But for UAAG 1.0, you need to move forward.       EH: I wouldn't use the word "equivalent" however - I would use  another     term.       IJ: We already proposed "alternative"       AG: Check out how ATAG uses "alternative". That should work.       /* AG notes that people are reading glossary entries as definitions  */       IJ: So rationale for broader 2.3:       * Some languages have inadequate markup       * Some languages are designed to use more general markup         (equivalents not just for accessibility)       Resolved:       * Broaden 2.3 to include all recognized alternatives. This is         broader than WCAG requirements to ensure that the user has  access.       Action IJ, EH, AG: Propose new definitions for terms in question     (equivalence, text element, etc.)      [5]Issue 322          [5]  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#322       Refer to issue 321.      [6]Issue 323 Using accessibility APIs rather than standard APIs to  make    non-W3C based content accessible          [6]  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#323       RS: I think you can differentiate standard APIs used for keyboard and     mouse access to support physical disabilities from the actual     rendering to the screen (e.g., in the case of Java or vector     graphics). The accessibility API provides the same information in a     better format than the output API.       IJ: Note that 1.2 still helps ATs that use an offscreen model. Be     careful about removing the requirement to use the standard output     APIs.       RS: MSAA and Java are about device-independent access (at the     component level), access to pre-rendered content. They do not support     the standard OS features for mobility access - that's the role of the     application.       JG: We can split 1.2 into input APIs and output APIs (support for     higher-level first, otherwise standard output APIs).       AG: So ATs that don't implement MSAA lose.       RS: There are cases where MSAA doesn't support all text. They're     fixing this.       IJ: Note that in Princeton we explicitly decided to require all     standard APIs, and suggesting higher-level APIs (not requiring them).       RS: Only recently did MSAA add access to element content. The Java     approach: we knew we had to run across several operating systems, so     we created an API to access text independent of platform. In that     particular case, you have a solution that is the "only solution" for     that platform.       Proposal: Change 1.2 to be "Use accessibility APIs, or if you don't,     use standard device APIs".       RS:       * Use the accessibility APIs for the target platform (e.g., Java,         Windows, etc.)       * Where those APIs don't provide access to all content, use the         standard system APIs for output (e.g., drawing text) or when they         do not support the system APIs for mobility access. For Java, you         would have to do this for mobility access features, system         high-contrast settings, and fonts.         DA: MSAA doesn't handle mobility access features: sticky keys         RS: For input: MouseKeys, SerialKeys, StickyKeys, RepeatKeys,         BounceKeys, ... For output: high-contrast and font size, font         family.       AG: There's an issue about the integration of input functionalities     with output functionalities.       RS draws a diagram showing input that goes through device-independent     layer, then system access feature layer. Output goes through system     access features layer first, then device independent layer.       RS: UAs must:       * Not circumvent the standard device-independent later.       JG: So we are saying:       * Don't circumvent standard input device APIs.       * Use accessibility APIs, or std output device APIs where they  don't         do the job.       RS: Support accessibility APIs plus the DOM. Where they don't support     text, use system APIs. Note that lots of people implement the     accessibility APIs.       AG: If the UA supports two ways to get at the information, that's     enough.       RS: Support system access features (e.g., sticky keys, etc.) [Covered     by 5.9].       RS: JDK 1.4, when it comes out, will support all of DOM Level 2.       AG: Distinguish three classes of API: MSAA/Java (access), DOM, device     APIs.       Resolved:       * Change 1.2 to require implementation of available standard         accessibility APIs, and where these APIs do not provide required         functionality (by this document), support standard device APIs.       AG: Make clear that information available as text must be available  as     text to the ATs (bits written to the screen don't count). Make the     text case a clear example.       IJ: Note that the Note needs to be edited in light of this. And the     part about not bypassing the standard output API is deleted.       AG: I think that the fact that the spec supports access to  information     through both the access level and at the DOM level is part of the     reasoning why all of the info needn't be available at the device     level.       RS: Need to ensure that there's documentation about how to have  access     to these APIs.

JG: People can create xml interfaces to documents in formats that are     not in a w3c format.       IJ: How do you reduce the instances where UAAG requirements need     interpretation?       DP: WCAG requires use of accessible formats. Adobe is trying hard to     make a user agent that is responsible for rendering their content. I     think they fall within our purview, but their format may not fall in     the scope of WCAG.       RS: Note that the latest release of MSAA doesn't support access to     tables.       JG: Recently I was playing with SPSS (a statistics package) and you     could output the results as HTML. One idea is to require output in at     least one W3C format.       IJ: That makes it an authoring tool.       AG: Is a piece of software that doesn't implement at least one W3C     spec really a Web app?       AG: One approach is to say that we don't have enough experience with     the accessibility process for PDF (e.g., WCAG 1.0 doesn't cover) and     therefore that shouldn't be our focus today.       HB: XSLT could be a valid way to get around this, but even after the     transformation you might have an inaccessible result due to lack of     information in PDF to begin with.       RS: We are starting to see formatting objects on the Web...       AG: I agree with Ian - to what extent can we write this document to  be     format-independent, and to what extent should it push people to use     W3C formats. This is a balancing act we are stuck with. I think it's  a     practical problem that for W3C formats, we have access to the specs     and it's easier to be clear about general principles. Yes, we'd like     to write functional requirements to help Adobe promote accessible     practices, but it's not so clear that we are in a position to write     general, clear requirements.       AG: The realities that we're looking at are like APIs: W3C formats  are     like APIs - they deliver the best engineered solution today for     accessibility. We should have something in here to promote those     formats.       HB: We have problems of W3C Recommendations are in conflict.       IJ: Note that "available" has some wording around it in techniques     about implementation schedules.       AG: You shouldn't have to go to the Techniques document to get this     information.       JG:       * If you use W3C specs, conform to them.       * If you don't support a W3C format, support an accessible format.       EH: We could say that we don't have specific criteria for identifying     what is "appropriate for a task" and leaving as it.       HB: These specs need to be open.       IJ: I have a problem saying "accessible spec" since we don't have a     spec that explains what that means.       AG: You need the format plus the software. You can say in a Note that     the developer needs to implement functionalities in the manner of W3C     specs.       EH: This reminds me of our discussion about the scope of our repair     requirements. When you talk about outputting PDF as HTML, that's a     repair functionality.       AG: Support format that can conform to WCAG.       IJ: Issues at stake:      1. P2: Implement formats that allow WCAG-conformant content      2. P2: Conform to implemented W3C Recommendations      3.

Note: Implement the latest version (improved accessibility, we         hope) that includes accessibility features.

Resolved:       * Requirement: Allow the user to configure playback rate according         to the range offered by the speech synthesizer.       * Informative:            + Rate depends on language            + Provide some example ranges for English and other languages            + Tell people that for ease of use, need to have granularities              for control (e.g., big jumps or small jumps, ability to              change rate on the fly).

DA: This could be a problem for users with cognitive  disabilities.         One idea is to allow the user to say "don't give me content in         these languages".       * Support for language, but resources not available       * Support for language, but language specified by author unknown       * No support for language       IJ: There are different issues for graphical rendering and speech     rendering. For graphical, encoding (should be) sufficient to tell UA     which character (though UA may not have glyphs). For speech, need  more     than encoding information, need natural language information.       Apparent requirements:       * Alert that there is lack of support for content in some language       * Indication in context of where lack of support occurs       * Skip over content in a language that isn't supported       IJ: (Phill Jenkins comment #3): Why is this an accessibility issue?       AG: This is an issue for speech users more than cognitive users (due     to serial access).       IJ: (Phill Jenkins comment #4): What if UA/AT doesn't know what     languages are supported?       AG: They can allow pass-through if they want. This is user control -     the user needs to be able to say "don't pass this off".       Resolved: Delete "marked up in a recognized but".       Notes:       * This is one switch, not a per-language requirement       * There may be cases where the conforming UA supports a language  and         a speech synthesizer does not, or vice versa.

This is all available in CSS2, by the way.       Resolved:       * Add notes to checkpoints for speech rate and text rendering (4.1)         indicating that the developer should consider per-language         configurability.       * In definition of profile, mention per-language profiles.       * The WG recognizes that per-language configurability is a  usability         gain.

[17]Issue 332         [17]  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#332       Proposed: A P1 requirement that the user must be able to choose from     all available dictionaries and to override author-specified and user     agent repair of unmarked up natural language.       JG: HPR 2.5 already does this. I suspect that JFW does this as well.       IJ: For graphical rendering, NN lets me choose encodings.       AG: Lynx allows you to force encodings as well.       EH: Is this a requirement just for users with disabilities? Or does  it     affect everyone equally? Not sure that this should be a P1     requirement.       EH: I don't think I support the P1 level because, in part, we should     be expecting WCAG-conformant content.       MQ: I don't think this is a P1 requirement. It's not a disability     issue.       RS: I don't think that this is a P1 requirement.       IJ: Who feels that this is an accessibility issue specifically: AG,     DA, GR, DP.       Is not an accessibility issue: BS, ST, RS, MQ, HB       EH: I could support a P3 requirement, but not if several types of     support are required (charsets, etc.)       GR: We do have a requirement for access to all content.       IJ: Strong support for speech P2 requirement for dictionary  selection:     DP, GR, DA, AL       Mild support: EH, IJ       No/Low support: Everyone else...       IJ: Note that 4.14 is about configuration, not control.       Resolved: P2 requirement for configuration of preferred dictionary.

JG: We require standard I/O, so I think this is covered.       AG: There are technologies like SoundEx that do phonetic matching,  but     we haven't include such a requirement in this document.       Resolved: This requires a clarification - matching within the     character set of the document. For information about input, refer to     the API checkpoints.

JG: Note that 5.8 is a P2 to use OS conventions.       DA: You should be able to provide other input configs if they are     better.       GR: There are two things going on:      1. Avoid conflicts with system conventions      2. Don't mess with bindings explicitly for the purpose of         accessibility.       IJ: We might add at the end of the checkpoint "for input".       EH: You can better justify the P1 by narrowing the scope this way.       AG: My problem with saying "for input" is that you are creating a     total input/output division and that's not how GUIs work. You     shouldn't interfere with some output features either (that may work     with input configs, e.g., sound sentry).       AG: It's important to support conventions of the OS even if they are     not specifically for accessibility (e.g., F1 bound to help) - that     standardization promotes accessibility.       RS: The default input config should respond to OS accessibility     conventions.       JG: Might add a note to 5.8 that using the std keyboard config     promotes accessibility.       EH: Is there a danger that access features might be so broad as to     impose burdens on AT developers (who would have less space to work     in).       Resolved:       * In 9.2, change "avoid" to "do not provide" (or some similar         wording that conveys a "must" requirement).

[31]  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#345       JG: We've had three comments on this one:       * Greg Lowney: Problem with all-or-nothing approach       * How do you observe that requirement has been met?       * Part about re-implementing input methods is still unclear.       JG: Some options:       * Leave as is (with clarifications)       * Narrow the scope to core functionalities (as we have done for         keyboard bindings)       * Delete       DA: Consider voice input: Naturally Speaking is close to hands-free.     ViaVoice requires some mouse/keyboard input.       JG: Full voice input may not be in scope for this document.       JG: We wanted keyboard access for all functionalities. If we reduce     the requirements for other input devices (mouse, voice), we will     address some requirements from users.       IJ: Is full functionality through the mouse an accessibility     requirement?       DA: Yes. Some people only have access through head pointers (and     cannot use voice input).       JG: You can exclude voice from your conformance claims.       IJ: It might be useful to have a "voice" content label (but that  would     the the first input in this section, so I'm not so sure...)       GR: I would prefer to see 1.1 stay as is. In the conformance claim,     have the developer have to specify which input APIs are supported.       AG: It's P1 to have all functions available through an API. If you've     got the keyboard API there, the fact that you add another interface     that does some of the functions should not degrade you from having     Single-A conformance.       RS: If the OS is controlled by voice, your application should also be     controlled by voice, period. If it's controlled by keyboard and  mouse,     then those should be the input APIs.       IJ: That's covered by checkpoint 1.2.       Some ideas:       * Require everything through the keyboard API (including cursor         motion, double-clicks, etc.)       * Demote 1.1 to P2 for mouse, voice, other input APIs. This assumes         that you can emulate everything through the keyboard API.       * Narrow scope of 1.1 to certain functionalities.       * Allow conformance for input methods other than the keyboard         (namely pointing device and voice).       * Note that people can make conformance claims with other software         such as an onscreen keyboard.         JG: HotMetal provide integrates an onscreen keyboard.       AG: A voice browser running at the end of a telephone is not really     the focus of these guidelines.       DA: Keyboard APIs already let you do mouse things and vice versa.     There are examples of full mouse accessibility through the keyboard     API.       JG: Our goal with 1.1 is to access functionalities of the UA. The  APIs     used to do that are not as big a deal.       EH: What if we limit the scope of 1.1 to keyboard and pointer API.       EH: What about this: All functionality has to be available through  the     keyboard or mouse API.       GR: Proposed: Leave 1.1 as is, but add that to conform you may  require     emulation via a standard API.       RS: Not required, here's an example: you may do voice recognition,  but     be able to do some things in a device-independent manner. If you  claim     support for a specific input modality, then the user with a  disability     should expect that all functions are available through that modality.       JG: Introduce modality in the section on conformance. Talk about the     checkpoints you must satisfy to make a claim for that modality.       EH: I hear:       * Rich wants to talk about devices/modalities in 1.1 and APIs in         1.2: if you allow voice input, you must allow control of all         functionalities through voice.         AG: This is about the user, not the API.         AG: You could satisfy 1.1 for three modalities by implementing         just one standard API (for the keyboard).         IJ: It sounds like 1.1 is about native user interface and 1.2 is         about APIs.         DA: You should not be able to conform for voice modality if you         don't allow access to all functionalities through voice.       Resolved:       * Edit 1.1 to talk about input modalities (not APIs) in the         conforming user agent's user interface. Leave as a P1         all-or-nothing requirement.       * For increased conformance granularity, include in the conformance         section the ability to claim conformance for individual         modalities. Keyboard is a required modality always. The other two         in UAAG 1.0 will deal with are pointing device and voice.       * There is no longer need for clarifying language about         keyboard-support-through-the-mouse-and-vice-versa.       * Remind people that they can conform with several components.        

      Hello,    In the 23 October draft [1], the "text" content label includes   three checkpoints: 3.3, 4.1, and 4.2, all of which refer to  requirements related to visual rendering of text:      3.3: Blinking and animated text. I assume here that this only         applies to visual rendering.    4.1, 4.2: Text size and font family.    Therefore, consistent with our use of the word "text" to   mean "characters (before rendering)", I propose changing the  content label to "visual text".     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hi Chris,    In the 16 Jan 2001 draft of the User Agent   Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [1], there are two checkpoints  that involve control of animations:     --------   4.4 Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of audio,   video and animations. For a visual track, provide at least   one setting between 40% and 60% of the original speed. For a   prerecorded audio track including audio-only presentations,   provide at least one setting between 75% and 80% of the   original speed. When the user agent allows the user to slow   the visual track of a synchronized multimedia presentation   to between 100% and 80% of its original speed, synchronize   the visual and audio tracks. Below 80%, the user agent is   not required to render the audio track. The user agent is   not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video and   animations whose recognized role is to create a purely   stylistic effect. [Priority 1]     4.5 Allow the user to stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and   fast reverse audio, video, and animations that last three or   more seconds at their default playback rate.  The user agent   is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video   and animations whose recognized role is to create a purely   stylistic effect. [Priority 1]   --------    We are currently discussing whether these requirements  should apply to any type of animation (does that make sense?)  or format used to create animation (markup, script, image format,  style sheet). Note: We have a general "exemption"  clause in our document (for the purposes of conformance) that  says that if the format doesn't enable the UA to recognize or   control the animation effect, then the requirements don't apply.    So my questions are:    1) Do you think that there are any classes of animation or     animation formats for which these requirements don't make     sense?    2) Do you have a good definition of "animation" handy?    Thanks for any input,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010116    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Gregory,    The W3C Process is designed so that anyone may request that  their objections be carried forward to the Director for review.  You are obviously welcome to register your objections as we  move the document to last call. It even seems very reasonable  that a thorough review of the document after so many changes  would lead anyone to raise some issues (this has happened to   me a number of times).     However, I personally do not want to spend any more  time debating the priorities of the checkpoints in question.  We did that a year ago. I personally do not wish to take any  more WG time to discuss these priority questions without  substantial new evidence.

Jon is right, however, and the first priority is the  implementation report.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

IJ: Keep resolving those issues!    5) Open issues after ftf    5.1) Issue 207       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#207         Refer to summary of 6 April minutes on "where we are":       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0037.html         IJ: I understand the open issue to be whether 2.1 scope should be           reduced to content for humans or left at "all stuff".         CMN: Human-readable content through the UI             is part of a minimal requirement for conformance to 2.1.         GR: I think the scope should be "all", not human-readable only.          DP: I'm still not sure what's lost if we don't include machine           content.         IJ: I think that the UA should use machine content to do repair           strategies, but that it should not be required to do so.         CMN: I think that if the user has access to all the content, then           the user can make repairs the UA couldn't make.         JG: Is this a requirement only for markup languages, or           also binary stuff?        CMN: Good question. It's harder to use a GIF image in source mode.           But I would continue to require them.        CMN: There's no requirement that if you make content available           through the UI that you also have to make it available           through some other means. There is no statement about            how many times you must make content available.      CMN:         a) Everything has to be available.         b) Things for humans must be available through the UI            (not through a source view).           In the real world:         c) There's no requirement for a source view. It will            meet requirement for things meant for machines.            However, if all the information meant for machines            is rendered somehow through the UI, then no other            view required.         IJ: I disagree that the user needs to know that "id"           is there.        CMN: Rendering is not sufficient.            You need to make available the fact that the content           is styled by "id". You need an interface that lets           you do everything you can do with an id.         IJ: But the "id" value is not required. What about a processing           instruction at the top of an XML document? I think that           we're talking about processing, and the effect if what's           important to the user, not the PI itself.        CMN: I would agree that that's an edge case.         IJ: What about the fact that all info is available through           the API?        CMN: Not sufficient.         HB: I want to be able to view all the content, including the           META information.         JA: I think I agree with HB.         DP: I don't see the validity, for the general user, of           having binary available to the general user.         JG: This machine stuff could be useful, but there's no           guarantee.         IJ: Suppose a user agent doesn't support PNG, must it           make it available?        CMN: No, only the URI to the PNG.         IJ: For those things not made available through the UI,           what's the minimal way to satisfy the other stuff?        CMN: A source view would meet the requirement. But the            minimal requirement would not be for a source view.         IJ: Why is this checkpoint different from other checkpoints           that allow some information to be handled through an           API?         CMN: We should require native support for access to           all content.         GR: In the case of rendering things natively, whether you           need to view binary: Lynx exposes the alternative or           puts in a place-holder - you can turn anything it can't           render natively into a hyperlink.        CMN: Lynx gives you access to applicable content, otherwise           gives you access to things it can't deal with (through            a link).         IJ: Should we adopt similar wording as ATAG about the "average           user"? That is, that the user is not expert. I have a problem           with P1 access to information that is not meant for humans           and will not be useful to most users. I do agree with           Charles, however, that if some of that "content" is not           available directly to users, it may not be accessible.        DP: What does it mean to "make available" information?        JG: Originally, some things through the UI and some through an          API.         Propose:        2.1.a: Ensure that the user has access to all content meant for                human consumption, including equivalent alternatives for                content, through the user interface.               Note: A source view does not meet this requirement. P1          2.1.b: Ensure that the user has access to all content meant for                machines either by processing it according to               specification or by making it available directly to the               user through the user interface.               Note: A source view would suffice to meet this               requirement.           IJ: Clearly 2.1.a a P1.             I agree with the first half of 2.1.b as P1, but             not sure about priority of second half since information             is available through an API. I'm not sure that the source              view would provide access to most people; I've heard people              say that most users would not be able to use this             information.          Consensus: The split is reasonable, as long as it covers                   the requirements.          GR, CMN: Unfortunately, people count the numbers of P1s. Also                 consistency with current PR.          IJ: I think both should be sacrificed for the sake of clarity.                JG: We've missed something if we've said that the other            checkpoints don't cover the accessibility of the user            interface and you need a source viwe.          IJ: This can be seen as a way to catch thigns that we've missed.         CMN: (Use case) I went to a Web site. The URI you could            use to get to the site started with "javascript:". The            only problem with my user agent was that it didn't support            javascript.          IJ: If you don't support javascript, then applicability kicks            in.         CMN: But it's in HTML, which is supported. The UA can either            provide some form of access or tell me to buzz off.           IJ: Sounds like you're requiring minimal repair strategy            is native support for source view.          JG: Sounds like what I'm hearing mostly is that 2.1.b is            not to improve accessibility of the user agent, but            to repair broken content or deal with (in)applicability.            We have another repair checkpoint (2.3). Do we need            another guideline for repair?          JA: UAs have already repaired broken content. It's one            of their primary duties.         CMN: I think the document's already too big. I don't            want another guideline.        Action IJ: Propose split to the list. Identify why and                 issue of priority.    5.2) Issue 208       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#208         HB: I think we have to be careful about form submit buttons           that aren't obvious.         GR: I think this should be addressed in the techniques document.         No objections to proposal:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0088.html         Action IJ: Adopt wording of proposal.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The priorities are to be determined on the basis of  > impact (as Eric calls it).    One moment, please. I think this is an important discussion.    1) The WCAG WG clearly established a scheme in which priority     levels are based on impact.    2) The ATAG WG adopted that scheme except that some participants     in the WG felt that other schemes would also be useful. If     I recall (and I may not, so excuse me), one scheme might have been:     "Priority 1 means that it must be satisfied to meet     the needs of expert users; Priority 2 must be satisfied to     meet the needs of average users; Priority 3 for novice users"    3) Robert Neff has suggested that implementation difficulty      should also be considered in deciding a checkpoint's priority.    I think it's very interesting to consider that other models  than "impact on the user" are conceivable. In fact, we should  embrace them to make our work easier and to keep our process  transparent as much as possible.    Consider the following ratings for checkpoint 1.1 of WCAG  1.0:  "Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element."      Priority 1:     Means: Vital to removing barriers to accessibility      Difficulty 3:   Means: It's easy to provide text equivalents that                    aren't synchronized with other content       Standard 1:     Means: Browsers and assistive technologies support                    text today and support consistently.    Summarizing:    - "Priority" refers to impact on users    - "Difficulty" refers to effort required by authors or developers    - "Standard" refers to current software support status    Comments:    1) There's no need to have a 1-2-3 scale for each rating model    2) There could be other rating models than these. For instance,     the "content vs. user interface" division is useful in both     ATAG and UAAG.    I think we all use more than one rating model for choosing  the priority of a checkpoint, though often the rating process  goes on silently because it diverges from the "impact" model  we currently use. By exposing the models we silently employ,  I'll bet:    1) We can avoid a number of discussions that in fact stem     from the application of different and unspoken rating     criteria;    2) We can provide more useful information to readers (though     not necessarily all in one document);    3) We can systematize the way we think of checkpoints and     add them to the guidelines.     I do not mean to complicate the actual priority   definitions; I think we should stick with "Priority"   to mean "impact on the user". However, it's not only worth  considering alternative models, I think we would benefit  greatly from a fresh approach.      - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I've updated the "User Agent Responsibilities" document [1].  Changes since the last version:     - Some minor cleanup to eliminate "I" and replace with "Working Group"     - Removed section on "Unknown" checkpoints and moved checkpoint 8.1     to the section on "Requirements for content rendered natively":           8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose          of each table and the relationships among the table cells           and headers.       This checkpoint was originally listed in "unknown" since I could     not come up with an "a priori" reason why this was a requirement     for general purpose user agents. In fact, the whole reason I  published     "UA Responsibilities" was that at the 10 December Austin meeting,  there     was little consensus about whether this checkpoint was required for     general purpose user agents. Note that the WG did resolve     that the requirement made by the checkpoint is for general      purpose user agents (refer to issue 160 discussion at the Austin     meeting).     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/01/ua-resp-20000125  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991210#issue-160  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    Per my action item assigned at the 9 December Austin ftf   for issue 172 [1], here is a proposal for a simplified   checkpoint 1.1.    Text in 20 December 1999 UAGL:    1.1 Ensure that every functionality offered through the user       interface is available through every input device API used      by the user agent. User agents are not required to      reimplement low-level functionalities (e.g., for character        input or pointer motion) that are inherently bound      to a particular API and most naturally accomplished with       that API. [Priority 1]     New text:    1.1 Ensure that each functionality available      through the user interface is also      available through each supported input       device API. Excluded from this requirement      are functionalities that are part of an input      API itself (e.g., text input for the keyboard      API, pointer motion for the pointer API,       etc.)    Notes on changes:     note 1) The Note after 1.1 would remain the same:             Note. The device-independence required by this            checkpoint applies to functionalities described            by the other checkpoints in this document (e.g.,           installation, documentation, user agent user            interface configuration, etc.). This checkpoint             does not require user agents to use all operating system           input device APIs, only to make the software accessible           through those they do use.      note 2) Changes will need to be propagated to checkpoint 1.4           (keyboard specialization).      - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991209#issue-172  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991220/   --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello Working Group,    I have put up a meeting page [1]  with information about  the meeting 10-11 April to be hosted by Recording for the  Blind and Dyslexic.    Please note:    1) Reserve your room at the Palmer Inn (the recommended hotel)     quickly and mention RFBD to get the discount rate of $77.     A block of rooms has been reserved for participants of this     meeting.    2) The registration form is not yet up but will be soon. I'll     keep the WG posted. Please register soon. The dealine is     5 April.    3) Breakfast is included at the Palmer Inn. Should we meet there     for breakfast instead of at RFBD?    4) Agenda to be announced, but we will primarily be addressing     issues that arise during the Proposed Recommendation review.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/ua-meeting-rfbd  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    The term "single command" is used in the UA Guidelines  in two checkpoints (from the 7 July draft [1]):       10.5 Allow the user to configure the user agent           so that the user's preferred  one-step           operations may be activated with a single input          command (e.g., key stroke, voice command, etc.).       10.8 Ensure that the default input configuration allows           easy activation of frequently used functionalities.            Note: Make the most frequent operations easy to                   access and operable through a single command.     The exact meaning of "single command" needs clarification.   Here are some questions:    1) For keyboard access, does "single command" mean one     keypress only? Or can single command include modifier keys?    2) What's the maximum number of keypresses that can be     considered to constitute a single command?     Is "Ctrl-X Ctrl-O" a single command? What about "Ctrl-x x"?    3) How do various OS facilities (such as StickyKeys)     fit into the problem? If combinations of modifier keys and     other keys are considered single command, does the usage     of StickyKeys change that?    4) What happens if the user agent enters a particular input     mode, which changes the input configuration temporarily so     that a new set of functionalities are one keypress away. Do     these keypresses count as single keypress since the user had     to do something else to enter the special input mode (e.g.,     table navigation mode where single keys may be used to navigate     around the cells of the table)?    5) What corresponds to single keypress for voice input?     It's probably not "single word" since I imagine being able to     say "Page Down". Don't forget internationalization when     trying to define the minimal discrete input act. I ask those     with experience designing voice-operated interfaces to      comment here: how does one express the minimal input     act (e.g., what occurs up to the next pause of more than     ms milliseconds)?    6) What about other input methods such as button activation?     Graphical UI is part of input configuration.    The following proposals offer a definition of "single  command input" and way to avoid related but different terms  that might cause confusion in checkpoints 2.3 and 10.8.    Proposal 1) Definition: Single command input      In this document, single command input means that the     action required of the user is the simplest that can be    recognized by the user agent for a particular input method.    For the keyboard, this means "single key input", i.e., a     single key press, without modifier keys such as "alt", "control",     "apple", etc. For voice input, "single voice command input"     means an individual vocal cue, though the number of words    in a command may be more than on (e.g., "Activate link",     "Page down", etc.) and should be few in number.     For graphical user interface components, single command input means    direct activation of the UI control (i.e., buttons, not menu    items) with a pointing device.    Note that any navigation through UI controls (by pointing    devices or keyboard navigation) does not constitute single    command input. Double command input means two single commands    (e.g., a modifier key and another key), triple means three, etc.        The user agent may change the input configuration dynamically,    and this may affect the set of single command bindings. The set    of single command bindings is relative to an input configuration.    For example, when the user is entering text, the number of    single key input bindings may be reduced significantly.     Or, if the user agent offers a special "table     navigation mode" for cell-to-cell or cell-to-header navigation,    those single key commands exist within the context of the    table navigation mode.      Note about proposal 1: Delete the part about different input modes      from the note after checkpoint 10.5 since now it's in a definition.    Proposal 2) Checkpoint 2.3      At the 20 July teleconference [2], we discussed eliminating    the expression "easy access" in checkpoints 2.3 and 10.8.    The proposal was to use "single command", which I find very    confusing (using the term "single" to describe two different    but closely related concepts is a mistake).       For checkpoint 2.3, refer to my proposal [3], which uses the    term "easy access" but explains the techniques that would meet    the requirement. I hope that this proposal satisfies the    resolution from the 20 July teleconference [2]:         "No objections to modification of Jon's proposal for modification  2.3       RESOLVED.- accept new proposal with modifications."    Proposal 3) Checkpoint 10.8      For checkpoint 10.8, Jon proposed [4] the following wording:         10.8 Ensure that the default input configuration             allows one step activation of frequently used             functionalities.      Rather than "one step" (or "single step") I propose saying     something like this:      <NEW>          10.8 Ensure that the default input configuration               offers single or double command access              to functionalities the user is likely to use               frequently.            Note: For example, the default configuration             might allow history navigation with arrow keys            alone, modified arrow keys (e.g., Alt-left arrow)            or both.    </NEW>      Notes about Proposal 3:      a) Some background about the goals of checkpoint      10.8 provided by Charles in his review with some developers [4].     b) There is no resolution marked in the       20 July minutes about checkpoint 10.8.      _ Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0097.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0132.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0032.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0243.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I discussed the conformance provisions of the guidelines   (Candidate Rec [1]) yesterday with Dan Connolly and have  made one addition and some editorial changes, listed below.    The old version of "Well-formed conformance claims"  required only the version number and operating system,  but not, for example, the name of the product or the vendor.    I propose the following new text:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  A well-formed claim must include the following information:       About the guidelines:        -  The guidelines title/version: "User Agent Accessibility  Guidelines 1.0".        -  The URI of the guidelines:  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128.        -  The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A".        -    The checkpoints of the chosen conformance level considered            not applicable. Claimants should use the checklist  [UAAG10-CHECKLIST] for           this purpose.     About the subject of the claim:        -  <NEW>The vendor name.</NEW>       -  The <NEW>product name</NEW> and version number.        -  The operating system name and version number.     Properties of the claim:        -  The date of the claim.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    Later on in the section "Validity of a claim", I've  made a strong link between the second bullet and the "subject  of the claim" (which is named in the previous section):    <BLOCKQUOTE>     A conformance claim is valid for a given conformance level if:      1.The claim is well-formed, and       2.The subject of the claim satisfies all the applicable         checkpoints for that level.   </BLOCKQUOTE>      Please let me know if there are any objections to these changes.       - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128   --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Checkpoint 1.2 of the 9 March draft [1] reads:       1.2 Ensure that the user can interact with all enabled          elements through keyboard input alone, and         pointing device input alone, and voice input alone.     This requirement is covered by checkpoint 1.1:       1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully          through keyboard input alone, and pointing         device input alone, and voice input alone.    Furtheremore, the Note after 1.1 starts:        "For example, ensure that through all three input modalities,       the user can interact with enabled elements..."    As I read this document on the plane, I felt that 1.2  was unnecessary and could be deleted without loss.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    In the 7 July UA Guidelines, checkpoint 2.7 reads:      2.7 For author-identified but unsupported natural         languages, allow the user to configure the user         agent to identify those language changes in content.    At the 13 July teleconference [2], I expressed a concern about  proposing the minimal requirement be to render the information  "in content" and got an action item to propose a change.  Please consider the following proposals:    1) Delete checkpoint 2.7. This checkpoint was initially      included in the UA Guidelines in support of the WCAG 1.0      checkpoint 4.1:           Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a          document's text and any text equivalents (e.g., captions).       As I recall, this checkpoint was included as a P1 requirement     to that screen readers capable of handling several languages might     switch dictionaries. However, checkpoint 2.7 is not about making     the markup provided by the author available to assistive  technologies;     it's abount rendering through the native UI. In my opinion,     our requirements to implement the DOM are the appropriate      reflection of the WCAG 1.0 requirement. And therefore, if the     checkpoint is not about the UI, I think we should delete it.    2) Don't delete checkpoint 2.7 because rendering content written in     an unsupported natural language with incomprehensible glyphs or     sounds may cause accessibility problems. I don't think we should  argue     that the problems are for assistive technologies (since they should  get     the information through the DOM). But we could argue for that many     users, including users with some disabilities, viewing content  through     a native viewport when that content is rendered as garbage may be     disorienting. We should either require the UA not to render garbage,     or to identify it as such.        I would note that the HTML specification, section 5.4 [5] discusses     the handling of undisplayable characters. It recommends the following     to user agents:          Adopt a clearly visible, but unobtrusive mechanism to         alert the user of missing resources.       Please consider the following wording for a revised P3 checkpoint:      <NEW>      2.7 For content in a recognized but unsupported natural           language, allow configuration so that when rendered,          this content does not disorient the user. The user           agent may choose to not render this content, but must          indicate the absence through the user interface.        Note: For example, if the user agent does not support        Japanese, render "[Japanese text]" instead of the content,        or use an accessible icon that indicates an unsupported language.     </NEW>    Other techniques:     - Render the name of the language and use a colored background     to indicate that content is garbage.    Notes:     - I have removed the part about the text being marked-up     by the author. I think the requirement should apply for     any text content recognized by the user agent as being     in an unsupported natural language. The techniques document     talks about ways to identify natural language.     - The requirement used to only be about changes in natural language.     However, I think the accessibility issue raised above applies     for all unsupported natural languages, even if the entire document     is in that language.       IMPORTANT: We decided (refer ot issue 174) to remove a requirement     to render content according to natural language specifications  because     we said that not doing so was not an accessibility issue. I'm arguing     here that rendering junk without warning the user that it's junk     may be an accessibility issue.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707/  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0056.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505  [5] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/charset.html#h-5.4  [6] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#174  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783          

      Earl,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed your last call  issues (383-388, your original comments [0]).    The complete second last call issues list [1] is available  online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been  incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].      NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call    draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have    been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.    Please indicate whether you are satisfied with the UAWG's  resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment.  Refer to section 5.5.2 of the 8 February 2001 W3C Process  Document [3] for information about requirements to formally  address issues prior to advancing to last call.    On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and  comments,     - Ian    [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0295  [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    ===============================================  The UAWG disagreed with you on the following:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #385: Add requirement that component size increases when objects  contained increase size? (your comment about checkpoint 4.1 and  your comment about UI checkpoints under Guideline 4):      Comment: The Working Group resolved not to include a general    resize requirement in UAAG 1.0. There is a resize requirement    for visually rendered text. This is now clearly stated in    section 1.3: "Known limitations of this document."    ---------------------  #388: Checkpoint 9.7: Raise priority to P1       Comment: This is now checkpoint 11.5. The Working Group has    discussed this issue in the past, and while we understand that this    feature is highly desirable, it would not impede someone from using    the user agent, although it may be difficult to use if the user has    to keep re-configuring.    ===============================================  The UAWG adopted your suggestion:  ===============================================    --------------------  #383: Checkpoint 3.2: Add definition of "placeholder"      Comment: Done.    --------------------  #384: Editorial Checkpoint 3.3: Add an example of stock quote ticker       Comment: This was not done yet, but will be added as an example    in the next draft. Please note that the WG confirmed that control    of animated text effects caused by scripts is not part of this    checkpoint.    --------------------  #386: Checkpoint 5.4: Move example to Note       Comment: Done. This is now checkpoint 6.4. Also note that    this is not a UI or content checkpoint; it's a communication    through an API checkpoint.    ===============================================  The UAWG answered the following questions:  ===============================================    --------------------  #387: Checkpoint 8.4: Where do labels come from? XML/HTML?         [You wrote checkpoint 8.5]      Comment: What is now checkpoint 10.4 states more clearly    that the labels come from the format specifications. The    checkpoint and Note read:       "10.4 Make available to the user an "outline" view of content,     composed of labels for important structural elements (e.g., heading     text, table titles, form titles, etc.). [Priority 2]         Note: This checkpoint is meant to provide the user with a       simplified view of content (e.g, a table of contents). What       constitutes a label is defined by a markup language       specification. For example, in HTML, a heading (H1-H6) is a label       for the section that follows it, a CAPTION is a label for a       table, the "title" attribute is a label for its element, etc. A       label is not required to be text only. For important elements       that do not have associated labels, user agents may generate       labels for the outline view. For information about what       constitutes the set of important structural elements, please see       the Note following checkpoint 9.9. By making the outline view       navigable, it is possible to satisfy this checkpoint and       checkpoint 9.9 together: Allow users to navigate among the       important elements of the outline view, and to navigate from a       position in the outline view to the corresponding position in a       full view of content."    ===============================================  The UAWG did not address these questions directly:  ===============================================    --------------------  About checkpoint 2.3: This checkpoint (and much of Guideline 2) have   been revised, so I believe that your recommended rewording is no  longer applicable. However, you are invited to read checkpoint 2.3  to see if it satisfies your request. Please note that the Working  Group has not given any of the four rendering options preference: any  one of the four will satisfy the checkpoint.    --------------------  About checkpoint 2.5 (now checkpoint 2.7): Refer to recent  proposal about minimum requirements for repair, not yet adopted:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0418.html    --------------------  About checkpoint 4.11: One answer to your question is that, according  to checkpoint 1.3, any non-text message through the user interface  must have a text equivalent in the user interface. Does this answer  your question/satisfy you?     We did not add a requirement that when the user has turned the volume  to silent (enabled by checkpoint 4.9), there must be a non-audio  signal when the audio has stopped playing. Please indicate whether you  wish to pursue this request for a new requirement.      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Q: Is there any need to change the document?        CMN: I propose that we remain in the status of tracking it.        RS: I wouldn't want to limit 5.1 to read-only. We do some tagging      to increase performance.        Action RS: Talk to people at IBM about sending techniques for      performance-enhancing techniques (and whether proprietary).         JG: You can always to more.        RS: Adding an event listener is like modifying the DOM. It's like      modifying the DOM (extended API). E.g., if you have a dynamic      document, you can listen to mutation events. Not necessarily a UI      change. Is adding an event listener considered a change to the      DOM? We are not changing DOM nodes.        JG: You could use the DOM 2 event model in 5.5. If we added, then      that might be part of a requirement for 5.5.        JG: Do we have implementation experience for the event model?        RS: I don't think so.        JG: I'm concerned about making DOM 2 event module a      minimum requirement if we don't have implementation experience,      notably to AT vendors who have not used it.        CMN: Our expectation today is that DOM will not change much      as it goes to Rec. We are specifying our requirements based on      that assumption. If there are dramatic changes, we will revisit      our requirements.        IJ: I believe we've already discussed changing priority of 5.7      (and decided not to) and also decided not to add additional       requirements.        RS: Making 5.5 with DOM event model a P1 probably not reasonable      at this point. I'm ok with 5.5 as is. Could add a P2 requirement      for DOM 2 event model.        CMN: I think that the guidelines should set a target for      developers. I would be unhappy about changing the priority level      based on implementation levels today.         IJ: Problem that people don't love all of the events module. And      you can't claim conformance to part of the module.        Resolved:        - Leave current checkpoints: Consensus.        - Don't add any other DOM Level 2 requirements.        1.Issue 316: Using the DOM to make available information on user  agent         generated content        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#316        Q: Is there a requirement that generated content be part of the      DOM (and thus available to the AT)?         Examples:       - Bad markup       - Configuration       - Missing resources        GR: What JFW does today (with COM/DOM) is give the user the      choice of ignoring graphics without alt text, reading the end of      the URI, or the alt information if present.        JG: I'm not sure that having the mainstream user agent put repair      content in the DOM is a good idea. We decided to make available      info the DOM because different renderings have different      requirements. A problem is that the AT user would not know what      comes from the author and what doesn't.          MQ: I think we should suggest, but not require inclusion of      generated content in the DOM.        GR: What HPR and PwWebSpeak do points the way for what mainstream      UAs should do: allow the user to configure how much information      should be provided by the UA.        RS: One problem - suppose that the AT is depending on what's      presented graphically, in addition to the DOM. If they are not      in sync, could be problem.        IJ: I think the document needs to say clearly that we are building      the UAAG 1.0 based on assumptions about the DOM. And we are not      requiring that UA's do things based on screen scraping.        GR: Issues:         - Effort         - Consistency         - Origin            RS: I think that if the UA repairs invalid markup, then the      this should be represented by the UA. For example, form control      that are outside the FORM element.        IJ: It's legal to put form controls outside a FORM element.        TL: We repair incomplete tables.        IJ: Repair is non-standard. I have a problem requiring      passing non-standard content through APIs to ATs. It could be      useful, but no guarantee that that will benefit accessibility.      Right now, we are not making requirements about the construction      of the DOM (in fact, we have intentionally said "we don't know      where it comes from: style sheets, markup, configuration, repair,      etc.).         CMN: I would argue that if the user agent changes the DOM, it      should alert the user.         IJ: I think most users would prefer not to be told and instead      just want the UAs to fix stuff silently.        CMN: I think that some changes made during parsing don't need to      lead to notification. But where you add content, you should      tell the user and also put it in the DOM. The fact that the      document has been changed on load is available.        RS: I don't think that's useful.        CMN: Why it's useful: I want to know whether the UA has made      a change as opposed to a change from the author.        RS: I think that the only reason you need a mutation event is      if you give it to the AT, then change it. But changes before      making available to the AT don't need to be told to AT.        IJ: I, as a user without a disability, have no idea that my      user agent has fixed content.         RS: And I have no control over how IE does its repairs.        IJ: Lots and lots of information can change from UA to UA based      on author changes, configuration changes, repair differences      (which are not standard), content negotiation, etc.        JG Summarizing:        - UAs do repair all the time.        - The only explicit repairs we require are 2.5 and 2.7        - Issue of whether user needs to know or wants to know which          repairs have been made.              EH: Is this part of the discussion about 1.5 (non-text messages)?        IJ: 1.5 is not about content but about UA's native UI.        EH: I have a suggestion: A checkpoint that requires the developer      to document any information that is likely to go to the user      interface but that may not be reflected in the DOM. I'm thinking      about six classes of information:           Information reflected in the DOM? (yes/no)         What kind of notification is required (none, in the moment, on  inspection)           EH: The UA developer would have to document which information      they're going to repair without notification (i.e., silently).      Or, some information will be rendered, but no notification, and      not in DOM.        RS: You don't always know what will end up being      displayed. Notably when you put style sheets in the mix. Also,       some repair techniques.         IJ: Proposed: Add a statement to the document that says:      Developers may put repair content in the DOM, but are not required      to by this document.        RS: There are better techniques for repairing alt text.        IJ: 2.5 expresses the minimal requirement.        RS: I'm saying that if a UA does the job, it should be in the DOM.      Why is that unreasonable?          CMN: I agree with RS - the overhead of putting it in the DOM.      I would go back to the suggestion that if you put it in the DOM,      you notify the AT. Reason: if you build an AT, then you might      do even more than what the mainstream UA.        RS: If a UA does repair, it should be reflected in the DOM.        JG: How does AT know that there's been generated alt? It can't get      that information through the DOM.        CMN: Hence firing the mutation events.        JG: You don't know who changed the node. It could be a script.        CMN: Now I'm thinking that this is not a requirement. The minimum      requirement for change is trivial. I expect that better UAs will      provide better techniques, and ATs will provide even better ones.      It's more a point of distinction than a requirement.            GR: The user doesn't care where the information came from, but      must have confidence that the AT is doing the right thing.        CMN: It's more useful for the AT to be able to tell the user:      a) There's no alt text b) there's generated alt text c) there's      author-supplied alt text.        CMN: So my preference is to not put it in the DOM or put it in      with a mutation event.         IJ Proposal for 2.5:        - If you put repair text in the DOM, notify the user.          IJ: But I don't know how this is this done.        CMN: I would like to see a recommendation that repair content      be put in the DOM and that if this is done, that there is      notification.        RS: If the UA does more than minreqs for 2.5, then include      in the DOM. But I don't know how you would use the event      model to indicate which element caused the change.        RS: The DOM implies structure to the document. Repairs that      change the structure need to be part of the DOM.        GR: I think this should be talked about in prose.        Resolved:        - Don't add any requirements to the document.        - Add prose to the document summarizing all of this discussion          (to 3.9 in Techniques).

That was not my understanding. At our 26 September teleconf [1],  we resolved to:     [[[    1. Make lists of important elements informative    2. Make minimal navigation requirements forward and backward    3. Use same configuration for important elements 7.6 and 8.4    4. Talk about Al's and others functional requirements for identifying       important elements (element type and number of resulting navigable  elements)   ]]]    I commented that "8.4 and 7.6 are separated for a reason.   The two are not inherently bound." One reason: an outline may  benefit people even if it's not navigable. Thus, a table of  contents in a paperback book is useful, but not navigable directly.    So my understanding is that the language you refer to is  not legacy but is still there intentionally. I thought that we  had decided that:     - One requirement was for navigation of important elements.   - One requirement was for an outline built of important elements.   - The set of important elements was the same for both cases.     For this reason, the requirement to be able to configure the     set could be shared by both checkpoints.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0455.html       >    This version:  >   > [9]<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023>http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/W  > D-UAAG10-20001023    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I'm forwarding an issue raised by Karl Dubost (of the W3C Team)  of the 23 October 2000 last call document.    1)  1.2 Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating system.    Issue: What if the standard input and output APIs "do the wrong thing"         or lead to accessibility problems?    IJ: This seems very similar to previous questions about following      system conventions. In the past, we've addressed this by saying      something along the lines of "unless they cause known accessibility      problems." One proposal is to add this. Another is to leave it      as is and say that this is an OS problem.    Also, a suggested technique for 7.1:       I suggest a double or triple mechanisms for navigation between  viewport.          - You have multiple windows open, ex: ctrl + Alt + tab to             switch between windows          - You have frames, ex: ctrl + tab to select the right frame.          - You are in a frame or a window, ex tab to select the link or  the box.       So, people will not have to pass all links of the first window/frame      before to have the right thing.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Perhaps it would be better to say something like "Provide clues  about natural language information".

I agree. There are trwo problems in the example part of 15.9:    a) The LINK element should be mentioned in a checkpoint about       navigation tools (that may be synthesized by UAs).    b) The part about archives is another solution that is not       related to the checkpoint. This has to be cleared up.    > 17.

Hmm, I recently changed them to designate specific versions  intentionally.  Perhaps unlike a technical specification, it's best in this case  to point to the latest version.

I disagree.    1) We have already decided on two occasions not to add any checkpoints  related     to installation other than .    2) We have also agreed to emphasize the importance of an accessible  installation     procedure.    Therefore, I believe the text must stay (per earlier WG agreements).  However  we could find a better place for it in the document.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

We have checkpoints for control of          scripts and style sheets.         JG: What about flash?        GR: Yes, increasingly used to create animated effects.        IJ: Probably need:         - A definition of "animation". What does this include?         - Consistent use of term "animation"        IJ: But heads-up - you can't really expand 3.2 to include      other forms of animation so easily (e.g., a full flash      presentation). But 4.4 is a broader class of animations.        EH: The definition of "presentation" may need review (since      URIs are required).        Action IJ and EH to review the definition of "presentation" to      possibly drop URI-dependencies.       /* Charles joins the call */       CMN: Currently, the basic guide to making flash accessible is to     provide an alternative. So the argument that it's not intuitive     to provide an alternative doesn't fly. In the case of SMIL     animation, animations have no impact on the DOM: it's style.       IJ: What about synchronized content? It seems like Guideline     4 is the appropriate place for control of synchronized info.          CMN: In the SVG case, the document can contain all of the     content, and the style changes depend on time. So when you     configure the UA to not render animations, you "kill" all pieces     and allow manual activation.        CMN: I think the G4 effectively cover what we would be talking     about.         IJ: Due to synchronization I think this is a complex issue.      If you render a document but not some time-sensitive parts,     the whole presentation/animation may be altered (in meaning).       JG: Another scenario: the whole presentation is an animation     so the placeholder would link to itself.         Resolved:        - No change to the document since we are uncertain about        the impact of turning off animations in general and then        turning them on later.       Action IJ and EH: Work on definition of "animation" that     identifies "animated image" as a special case. Also talks     about script effects, style sheets effects, markup languages     as being able to create animations. (Blinking not part of     animations...?)    /* Charles leaves */        5.Issue #431: New requirement: conforming UA must make available                     preferences through API.        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#431        IJ: Does a plug-in need to go through the UA, or can it query the      OS?        RS: It depends on what language it's written in. You can,      in Java, query the OS directly. I don't think we should       require UAs to pass through preferences.        JG: I think that we should note that the UA should make config      information available to plug-ins, players, and other software.        RS: You may be introducing security/privacy holes if the plug-in      can write to the OS. I don't believe there are standards for      making available config information to plug-ins.        Resolved:        - No standard mechanism for doing this today to our knowledge,         so we will not add a checkpoint (no implementation experience)        to this version of the document.        Action IJ: Ask the reviewer to provide an example of how this      would be done, for inclusion in the techniques document.        6.Issue #432: Checkpoint 3.4: Overlaps with 3.2        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#432        Resolved:           - We distinguish blinking images from animated images           and have different requirements for each (e.g., no need           to slow down blinking). Therefore, no change to the           document.        7.Issue #433: Checkpoint 3.6: Is control required when redirection  is                     "instantaneous"?        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#433         GR: So, for example META with a redirect value of "0".         IJ: How slow is slow enough to be annoying?         GR: Check out AERT document - it addresses the "0" value.            (ERWG has discussed this). Some client-side redirected           pages have content, others do not. Some authors use           this as a hack rather than doing server-side redirect.         Resolved:         - Agree to make change to 3.6 suggested by reviewer.       - Add a technique that the UA allow configuration to         allow manual link anyway for 0 time.              Action IJ: Change 3.6 to account for instantanous redirect.        8.Issue #434: Checkpoint 4.13: Clarify that the user must be able to                     override author-specified volumes.        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#434         Resolved:           - For 4.9, add an configuration option to override              author-specified and UA default settings for global volume.        - For 4.10, 4.12: Add Note after checkpoints to clarify             that this includes override of author-specified             volumes.        9.Issue #435: Checkpoint 4.14: Is this for content only or UI as  well?        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#435        Resolved:        - No, the checkpoint in question (speech paramter control)        is for content only.        /* Additional discussion on different headings */       EH: Should we incorporate "for UI accessibility" into checkpoints?         They are normative, it would seem.       IJ: Only "through an API" is normative right now. I agree that if     the groupings       JG: We will continue the discussion about checkpoint groupings     at the next meeting.    No change to open action items:        1.IJ: Update 8.8 techniques.       2.IJ, EH, AG: Propose new definitions forterms in question  (equivalence, text element, etc.)       3.IJ: Get wording from Martin for thisrequirement (e.g., "conform",  "implement", etc.) for issue 327       4.IJ: Add a P3 checkpoint on user control of windows that  automatically close       5.IJ: Add a clarification to checkpoint 4.20 including:               If a viewport includes other viewports, then this  requirement only applies to the topmost viewport.               Add a Note that other requirements still apply to  sub-viewports       6.IJ: Delete second sentence from 4.21       7.IJ: Add to end of first sentence "with which it overlaps" in  checkpoint 4.21       8.IJ: Add "that benefit accessibility" to end of second sentence of  checkpoint 5.8       9.IJ: Put a note in the definition of active element that this does  not include selection. (optional clarification note)      10.IJ: Include selection and focus in note after 1.1 as examples of  what must be done.      11.JG: Implementation information for guideline 2      12.JG: Propose a list of things we areexpecting UAs to recognize in  scripts.      13.JG: Schedule face-to-face time with other WGs (need to contact  voice and mobile)      14.JG: Propose text for the techniques document about synthesized  speech implementation issues.

      Hello,     In the Proposed Recommendation, checkpoint 5.3  (priority 2) reads "Avoid using tables for layout."    During the teleconference today, we discussed this  enigmatic checkpoint and its priority. The discussion  began as I recounted how, when analyzing the accessibility  of the W3C home page, I (and some other W3C Team members)  felt as though the page was still accessible despite featuring  a layout table. The W3C home page is designed so that it  still makes sense when table markup is ignored (e.g., by Lynx).    Checkpoint 5.3 as written today means that if you use   any table for layout, your page or site cannot conform   to the Double-A level. And yet, the W3C home page does   not seem like it poses significant barriers to accessibility.    I would like to propose the following rewrite of the checkpoint:    5.3: Design all layout tables so that the content       is presented logically when the table is linearized.        Priority 1.    This checkpoint then resembles checkpoint 6.1, which reads:         6.1 Organize content logically using appropriate            structural markup so the organization remains clear           even when associated style sheets are turned off            or are not supported.     Linearization will be discussed in the techniques.    Some will argue that using a table for layout is a misuse  of markup and I agree with them. We must emphasize style sheets  as the right way to lay out pages. This proposal will not  please purists, who have strong arguments for ensuring  that tables be used only for tabular data. Jason White has  successfully argued that BLOCKQUOTE not be used to  indent text as this misuse confuses some tools. The same  reasoning could be applied in this case, and that would be  a strong argument for keeping the current checkpoint  wording.     However, if there are ways to use tables that   "transform gracefully" (and that obey other checkpoints)  AND if readily available technologies can linearize those tables   (as Lynx does), then please consider this proposal.

Whether they generate it or whether they should are, as usual,  distinct questions. From the HTML 4.01 specification, section 13.6.2  [1]:       User agents that do not offer the user a means to select      specific coordinates (e.g., non-graphical user agents that rely on      keyboard input, speech-based user agents, etc.) should send the      coordinates "0,0" to the server when the link is activated.

I agree with this, though I am not sure it adds significantly to the  checkpoint.     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Deleting Guideline 9 may sound like a radical proposal, but  I don't think it is. Here's the idea:    In the 29 September Guidelines, the Guideline reads  "Alert the user of content and viewport changes." However,  the checkpoints under Guideline 9 are not about notification.  The three Guideline 9 checkpoints are:       9.1 Ensure that when the selection or content focus changes,         it is in a viewport after the change.    This checkpoint could easily go alongside checkpoints 4.18 and  4.19, which are about viewports opening and focus changes.       9.2 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any          form submission not caused by explicit activation of a            form submit control.       9.3 Indicate the relative position of the viewport in rendered         content (e.g., the proportion of an audio or video clip that         has been played, the proportion of a Web page that has been         viewed, etc.).     These checkpoints could easily go in Guideline 8 (Orientation).    Thus, I think that since none of the checkpoints in Guideline 9  are really about notification, we should delete the Guideline  and redistribute the checkpoints appropriately.    Where did the "notification" checkpoints go? In the 5 November 1999  draft (the "first" last call draft <smile>), Guideline 9 included  six checkpoints. The additional checkpoints were:    9.1 Provide information about user agent-initiated       content and viewport changes directly to the user      and through APIs. [Priority 1]     9.4 Allow the user to configure notification preferences for common  types       of content and viewport changes. [Priority 3]     9.5 When loading content (e.g., document, video clip, audio clip, etc.)       indicate what portion of the content has loaded and whether loading       has stalled. [Priority 3]     Working backwards, here's where they went:    1) Checkpoint 9.5 ("stalled" loading). At the 10 August 2000 teleconf  [3],     the WG resolved to delete this checkpoint since it could not identify     any requirement specific to accessibility. Notification of loading  status     is important to everyone and the UA must present that information in     accessible manner (covered by checkpoint 1.5).    2) Checkpoint 9.4 (configuration of notification preferences). This     checkpoint is a configuration checkpoint for 9.1, so when 9.1 was     deleted 9.4 was also deleted. Refer to the resolution to delete at  the     31 August teleconference [4].    3) Checkpoint 9.1 (information about changes).  We resolved to delete  this     checkpoint at the 20 January 2000 teleconference [5] as a result of      review during the first last call. We also raised the priority of the     checkpoint requiring user control of changes (now checkpoint 3.7).     For more background, refer to issue 142 [6].    Thanks,     - Ian    P.S. I'm making this proposal in order to help ensure that each       checkpoint fits under a Guideline appropriately. I would note,       however, that if we delete Guideline 9, we also have the attractive       result of ten Guidelines...

Checkpoint 1.1 refers to *everything* you can do with the UA: both  chrome and content. Therefore, 1.2 is really a very specific part  of 1.1.    That's why 1.1 says "operate the user agent fully."

      12 September 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Jim Allan   Harvey Bingham   Dick Brown   Tim Lacy   David Poehlman    Absent:   Rich Schwerdtfeger   Charles McCathieNevile   Mickey Quenzer   Eric Hansen   Gregory Rosmaita    Regrets:   Kitch Barnicle    Denis Anson    Next meeting: 14 September    Minutes of previous meeting 7 September:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0362.html    Agenda:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0372.html    Announcement:      New charter draft:         http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/charter-20000510       IJ: Heads-up about a particular sentence of the proposal:        "The accessibility of mainstream user agents that support text,  audio,       video, animations, and synchronized multimedia."       IJ: Refer to related comments from EH:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0355.html    1.Issue 297: Style vs. content and background sounds    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#297        Ian's proposed resolution to 297:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0371.html      /* Ian summarizes proposal */      JG: One question: do we need to indicate to the user which content        has been generated by the UA?         I propose not a relative (new) checkpoint. I propose       requiring at least level Double-A.      DP: You don't need to know where it comes from.      IJ: Are placeholder images available in the DOM? Or         do you get what the author has provided?      TL: If you tell IE not to display images, and you ask to        show the image, then IE doesn't rebuild the DOM. The         placeholder image is in the DOM only.      Q: Should repair content, place holders in the subject    of the claim be in the DOM (e.g., available to ATs).      /* TL does experiments with turning of image support in IE */       TL: MSAA says that:      a) The object's role is a graphic provided by IE server.      b) State is unavailable.      c) Value is original URL of image that would be displayed      d) Coordinates available.      IJ: Another way of asking the question: does repair content    need to be in the document object?       JG: I think that the main reason we are requiring the DOM    is to provide ATs with the information provided by the author.      TL: If you're walking the DOM and you see that the state of the    image is unavailable, what you get on the screen is the same    whether you've configured the UA not to display images or     whether the image is unavailable.      IJ: Is what the UA doing in these cases more about user interface    or is this <em>content</em> that needs to be available to     ATs.       DP: I'm not ready to comment on which way this should go.      /* David leaves */      TL: The rest of the proposal seems reasonable. I don't have     any problem with it. There may be a node in the DOM for    a background sound.      IJ: Note that this applies to images (which we're used to),    but also audio, video.      TL: I think that for background sounds, you are still    invoking media player, even though you don't get a user    interface. The difference would be that on configuration,    the media player's UI would be brought up.      EH: Should the three-seconds be configurable?     Resolved:    Of Ian's proposal:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0371.html     a) Adopt proposed changes to Guideline 3    b) Adopt proposed changes to Guideline 4    c) In last call, point people to three-second parameter and       get feedback.     Action IJ: Incorporate in next draft.     However: raise a separate issue:     Is content generated by the User Agent required to be in      the DOM, or is it part of rendering in the native UI only?    Open Action Items        1.GR: Proposed repair checkpoints    Completed Action Items        1.JG: Send announcement on extra telecon for 9/12/2000        2.IJ: Repropose some of the checkpoints in Guideline 3 and 4 based  on         today's telecon         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0371.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Chris,    Checkpoint 11.4 of the 5 May 1999 Guidelines reads:           11.4 If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible       page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C        technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or       functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible        (original) page. [Priority 1]     This means at least two things related to your question:    1) Where possible, you should try to create one accessible     page rather than two pages that in tandem are accessible.     In particular, a text-only page does not accomplish     some of the goals of accessibility (since accessibility     is not just about content reaching peoples ears, eyes,     or fingers, but also orientation, navigation, clarity,     etc.)    2) You may use a conformance logo on one page if that page     in tandem with other pages produces an accessible result.     And, you should say near the logo how to find the     complement that ensures accessibility.

      Hi Eric,    I would like to avoid defining a text element as something that can  be rendered in three modes. I prefer instead to say that in this  document, the term "text" means a sequence of characters from  a document character set (refer to discussion in HTML 4 specification  [1]  and more discussion in W3C WD on character model for the Web [2]). This  view of text seems to me to be both more intuitive and also more  consistent   with current usage. I do agree with you that it is fundamental for  information  to be available in three modes, and text characters go a long way to  enabling that, but technology could allow other solutions.    Characters as (abstract) units of natural language information  differ from their their encodings on a computer and the glyphs   or phonemes used to convey them.     I wouldn't want to require the UA to search   on anything other than those text characters in the document object   that are rendered. (I would not want to require today a search  through phonemes or glyphs or other audio or graphical information.)    Where those characters come from (source, style sheets, scripts, etc.)   shouldn't matter as long as they are (a) in the document object and   (b) rendered (since searching through unrendered portions of content  would be confusing). So Harvey's question about style sheets is a   good one, but as we've done in similar situations, we should "punt"   and simply say "whatever is in the document object, however that's  constructed".     Proposal, based on Eric's text:    <NEW BY IAN>  7.5 Allow the user to search through text that has been rendered.       The search must encompass all text within the      viewport, both inside and outside the point of regard. Allow the       user to start a forward search from a location in content selected       or focused by the user. After a match, allow searching from       location of the match. Provide a case-insensitive search option       when applicable to the natural language of text. [Priority 2]     Add to definitions:     Text      In this document, the term text refers to a sequence      of characters in the sense of a "document character set"      as used in SGML and XML. One example of a document character      set is the Universal Character Set (refer to ISO10646 and      Unicode).     Add to techniques: (same as below).  </NEW BY IAN>    Of course, adding a definition of "text" implies that we need  to review how the term is used in the document. I suspect that  we use it in at least three ways:    1) What one can read (e.g., text messages).     I doubt we use the term in this way a lot, as in     "I found the text challenging but well-written."    2) Character glyphs (e.g., text size, conformance levels     are spelled out in text as in Double-A (not sure)).       3) Characters in the sense described above. I think this     is the sense that applies to searching and to text     equivalents, text messages, text-to-speech, text input,     text links, repair text, text browser (not sure here),        text field, and text transcript.     text labels, text titles,     A quick scan of the document leads me to believe that we  could define text as a character sequence and then fix  those instances of "text" that refer to character glyphs.     - Ian      [1]  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/charset.html  [2]  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-charmod-19991129/      Eric Hansen wrote:  >   > Ian,  >   > One concern I have about checkpoint 7.5 is that renderings of text elements  > (including text equivalents) do not necessarily look like "text" (i.e., text  > characters).  >   > For example, our tacit if not explicit definition of a text element as  > something that can be rendered and understood in three modes:  > visually-displayed text, synthesized speech, and braille.  >   > But that is only a MINIMUM REQUIREMENT for a text element.

      Hello,    I'm currently reading the UA Guidelines, but due to my cold,  I won't be able to publish a new draft until tomorrow. I apologize  for the inconvenience.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      Hello Working Group,    As starting points for discussion at tomorrow's teleconference,   please consider the following comments and proposals.    >     1.PR#278: Definition of "content", etc  >       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#278    Please read Eric Hansen's latest version of the definitions.   I propose that we adopt them, and add a note that some people  use the term "content" to mean "information" (not data). However,  in the document, we should (if possible) only use content in  one sense. I will have to review how it is used in the document  to confirm that usage.    Eric's proposal:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0177.html      >     2.PR#271: Checkpoint 4.7: Change to P2 since arbitrary                   repositioning not a requirement.  >       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#271    I have an action item to get Madeleine's take on the priority  for this checkpoint, which I will do separately. We don't need  to discuss it tomorrow.     >     3.PR#257: Difficult to know when a UA has conformed.  >       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#257    I propose we discuss this last and that we first discuss two things:     1) How are we going to indicate our results in the document?      I propose that information about what needs to be done      for conformance appear clearly at each checkpoint (i.e., in      the guidelines).     2) What are the pieces of the framework we are using to       identify what it takes to conform? I have heard at least two      ways to consider answering the question, and I think both      will be useful and necessary:       a) In some cases, the minimal requirement may be identified        easiliy (e.g., all the checkpoints that require the        UA to allow the user to turn off some feature).       b) In other cases, it is easier to provide a reference        implementation and say "This would satisfy the checkpoint,        but we can't easily express a minimal requirement."        Refer to Al's comments on "Minimum v. Reference Implementation"         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0186.html      >     4.PR#233: Checkpoint 7.6: What does "structure" mean here?  >       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#233       Refer to Al's email:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0188.html       Proposal:          1) We leave the word "structure" in the checkpoint text           (Allow the user to navigate according to structure.)        2) Explain that structure is based on the document object           model (in the generic sense) but may have more           semantic information when known for the markup language.        2) Therefore, the minimal requirement (since the goals are           orientation and rapid navigation) is to allow navigation           according to the semantic model known for the markup language,           paying particular attention to block and grouping mechanisms.        3) Add Al's comments to techniques document.    >     5.PR#207: Interpretation checkpoint 2.1  >       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#207        Proposal:       1) Leave 2.1 checkpoint text the same.        ("Make available all content, including equivalent           alternatives for content.")     2) Require that for content known by specification to        be for users (including information in style sheets),        that a document source view does not suffice.     3) A document source view (or better) satisfies the requirement         of making content available when otherwise difficult        (e.g., style sheets, script source) or when it is not        possible to know from the markup language specification        which content is meant for users.     4) The "document source" view is not a view of the        document object (the structured navigation view). The        user should find for example, raw script and style        sheet data in the source view.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Per my action item from the 24 July UA teleconference [4], please  consider this proposed revision to checkpoint 10.4. This proposal  relies on the definitions of "single command input" and "double  command input" from another proposal sent earlier today [5].    In the 7 July draft [2] checkpoint 10.4 reads:    <OLD>    Allow the user to change the input configuration.  </OLD>    I propose the following detailed modification based on  our conversation at today's teleconference:    <NEW>     10.4 Allow the user to change the input configuration as follows:       - If the user agent default input configuration offers a binding         to a functionality for a given input method (e.g., keyboard,  voice,          etc.), allow the user to reconfigure that binding for that         input method. If a single command binding is not available         for a functionality (refer to checkpoint 10.5),          the user agent must allow the user to assign a double          command binding.       - The user agent is not required to allow the user reconfigure         bindings that have special meaning in the operating system         (e.g., access to help).  </NEW>    Here's a breakdown of how the input method  checkpoints of the 7 July Guidelines make requirements  about (1) the set offunctionalities to which the user   must have access and (2) what the user agent must do to provide  easy access to those functionalities and (3) configurability.    A) Requirements of checkpoints 1.1 and 1.3:     Functionalities: all must be available.     Ease of access:  no requirements specified          (i.e., as long as the functionalities are available through            the API, it doesn't matter how many keystrokes it takes to           get at them.)     Configurability: no requirements specified.    B) Requirements of checkpoint 10.4:     Functionalities: all must be available.     Ease of access: single keypress, voice command, etc.     Configurability: Required. No constraints on the set of input  commands.             C) Requirements of checkpoint 10.5:     Functionalities: some must be available (refer to list [2]           that the WG resolved to adopt at the 13 July           teleconference [3], though there have been comments on            this list since then).      Ease of access: anything beyond single keypress, voice command, etc.     Configurability: Required. No constraints on the set of input  commands.    At the 24 July teleconference, we discussed the following possible  changes:    Change 1) For 10.5: Augment the set of required functionalities             to all functionalities. If this is done, 10.4 and 10.5 can            be combined since 10.5 would make more stringent            requirements than 10.4 and they would otherwise be            identical.    Change 2) For 10.4 and 10.5 (presumably):            Diminish the set of input commands the user agent would            have to make available for configuration as follows by            not requiring the UA to allow configurations that would            interfere with system conventions. (Note that this is            different from forbidding such configurations; we're only            saying the UA doesn't have to allow the user to override             system conventions).    Change 3) For 10.4: Diminish the set of required functionalities             to those which have bindings in the UA's default  configuration.            Thus, if a keyboard binding is offered to the user for a given            functionality, the user must be able to override it.    The above proposal combines changes 2 and 3 for checkpoint 10.4.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0037.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0056.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0126.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0134.html  --    Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Dennis,    Thank you for the heads-up. This is noted (entry 3) in our  errata page [1] and will be fixed in the next draft (which we're  working on).     - Ian  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      Minutes 30 June UAGL Teleconference     Ian Jacobs (Chair/Scribe)   Charles McCathieNevile     Harvey Bingham   Marja Koivunen   Glen Gordon   Gregory Rosmaita   Jim Allan    Regrets:     Rich Schwertdfeger   Jon Gunderson   Mark Novak     1) Action CMN: Send URI on default keyboard bindings to list. Ian                    will then include in Techniques document.       Status: Done.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0263.html       Charles has an update on this (and will send to the list).       CMN: In "modern" systems (e.g., Gnome, etc.), you can build your          own bindings at will. The "default" configuration          is less apparent. The problem is more complex than just          advising people not to overwrite certain bindings.       HB: IE has about 30-40 bindings. There's some redundancy in         bindings.         2) Action CMN: Send request to blinux users for info about                  orientation.        Status: Not done.     3) Action IJ: Send similar request to IG.       Status: Not done.     4) Action GG: Send ideas on dependent tool point of regard to list.       Status: Dropped on GG's request.     5) Action Editors:        - Add checkpoint about turning on/off author-supplied          keyboard bindings.       Status: Done in internal source files.    Agenda   [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0259.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0262.html    1) CMN proposes allowing the user to configure the arrangement of     user interface controls (visually) as a P3.     (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0241.html)       CMN: Tabbing order as much as visual layout. Grouping of controls          and how you get to them. You can do in MS Word and it's very          handy.          IJ: Why do you need to control tabbing order if you have direct         access through keyboard commands?       GG: Novices don't have to memorize keyboard bindings.       GR: One problem with adaptive tech is that unless you have         a toolbar turned on, it won't echo certain formatting         changes. Don't want to have to rely on display of controls         for access to their functionality.          CMN: I'm interested in grouping controls. E.g., with low vision,          want few controls with lots of separation.       IJ: Default is to follow system conventions. But users can         override.       MK: Are we talking about moving around only or being able         to add and delete controls?       CMN: Yes, variety in implementations.       No objections and some support for Priority 3 Checkpoint.     Resolved: Add this checkpoint.     Action: Editors to add to next draft.    2) Checkpoints for guideline 3, about documentation, should be P1.     having to guess these things makes it effectively impossible.     (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0241.html)      CMN: If you have to guess, your lost. Hidden and secret is not         acceptable.      IJ: But "3.2" is about grouping.      CMN: All features of the product must be documented.      IJ: What's the accessibility about documenting all functionalities?      IJ: Are you suggesting "User agent functionalities        described by checkpoints in these guidelines must be documented."       CMN: Yes. Priority 1.      Resolved: No objections to adding this checkpoint.      HB: I'd also like a starting point from the software (readily  available)        that lets me find keyboard bindings.      CMN: For 3.3 - communication of the information is as important         as being able to do it.      Resolved: No objections to changing 3.3 and 3.4 to Priority 1.      GR: Technique for 3.4 - put default keyboard config in README file        at a minimum.      Action editors: Add these checkpoints, make these changes.    3) Proposal on changes to navigation checkpoints  (http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#66)      IJ: What does it mean to navigate the document tree?      CMN: Prefer to use the term "structure" instead to allow        ambiguity: real (parsed) source tree or a remap of the DTD        (e.g., headings are nested in HTML). More about navigating        what the structure "should be".       CMN: I want a technique that lets people "pass over" information,         but better than just by scanning the entire         document. Sequential gives you context.      MK: It might be that people generally navigate what's rendered        (could be default). Informed users might want to navigate        the tags or through CSS things.      GG: You do need to be able to move backwards and forwards.            IJ: What's the step size?      GG: Have a point of regard that you can navigate by line, word,        sentence, paragraph.      CMN: Move the point of regard, whatever the size of the zone.         And allow configurability.      GG: We are moving from looking only at rendered text to looking        at the document source. This is much richer than just        manipulating rendered info.      CMN: For sequential navigation - fundamental navigation is being         able to read through document in point-of-regard size chunks.         (e.g., line-by-line in braille display).      IJ: I do page down in NN. How do dependent UAs work?      GG: Similar behavior for rendering to speech.       GG: Proposes - allow sequential navigation suitable to device being        used.       IJ: The viewport in short.      CMN: Three ways to navigate the document -         a) Continuous feed (optionally being able to start/stop).           This one is fundamental.            IJ: We have a checkpoint for this: access to all content.          b) Divide the document into structural components (without            specifying how that structure is built exactly - not            necessarily the DTD).                  CMN: Jon has argued that this is really important and I                agree. Tree navigation is one technique.             GG: A lot of structure is unimportant to many users: DIV and                OBJECT elements. Navigating the tree is less useful                than navigating some commonly used terms - paragraphs,               headers, etc.             CMN: Yes, strict tree navigation is clunky, but minimally                satisfies the need.              IJ (summarizing):                  - Allow navigation of document structure.                   - Techniques explain how:                    a) DOM is minimal (tree nav)                    b) Mix of rendered/source                    c) Use commonly understood document models                       (based on DTD, but may not match exactly).                    d) Simplify view of structure for user.                    e) Allow the user to control level of detail/                       view of structure.             Resolved: Add a checkpoint about (Pri 4) navigating the                     document in a structured manner. For all                     user agents. Delete 7.8 (doc tree navigation).                     Add a (Pri 3) checkpoint to allow configuration of                     the structured navigation mechanism.          c) direct access to an identified point.           IJ: We have a checkpoint for this: search text.    4) Notification of document changes due to scripting events  (http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#54)  (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0197.html)       CMN: First requirement is that all changes must be available          to AT and user. Probably too much information, so better          implementations will do better.       Jim: Depends on what the purpose of the change is. On my site          for low-vision users, when you move around, the font          size increases. This would annoy screen-reader users.          Information that people want available can vary greatly.       CMN: Given that you can't tell a priori, you must make it          available. I think Pri 1 for desktop to AT and AT to user             as well.       MK: Need some useful default filtering so that user is not         overwhelmed.       Jim (to GG): Can you set up Jaws so that users are informed           of font changes?       GG: We're moving towards being able to do this (and make notification         optional).          NOTE: There's a mix of user needs and author's intentions in using           style that means you can't predict a priori which style info           to communicate.        GR: E.g., drop down menus with links in them (e.g., MS site).       CMN: User agent can tell you that the document (tree) has changed.       GR: MS calls this "active scripting".  Happens at a lot of         commercial sites.       Resolved: Generalize 9.2 (drop part about scripts) to talk about               changes to the document. Not just user-caused. For               all user agents. Priority 1.       CMN: Configuration is a higher priority checkpoint in this case          (at least P2).       GR: Priority 1 (my own selfish reasons).       GG: IE 4/5 communicates this info through o.s. conventions today.

My opinion is that, since alternative pages should be used as little  as possible, you should avoid where possible creating an   alternative site. However, it would make sense that if you have a   particular type of page that appears frequently and is always   inaccessible alone, you could/should promote easy navigation within that   set of pages.     > C: Regarding Compliance Scope.  >   > The guidelines state:  >   > Form 2: Include, on each page claiming conformance, one of three icons  > provided by W3C and link the icon to the appropriate W3C explanation of the  > claim. Information about the icons and how to insert them in pages is  > available at [WCAG-ICONS].    Please note that the conformance statements in ATAG and UAAG are more  general and we're slowly improving conformance provisions since WCAG 1.0  was published. Check out, for instance, the UAAG Proposed Rec  conformance  section:         http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/#Conformance    There's still work to be done to show how to use metadata to  describe scope, etc.     > Questions:  >   > 1.

I would argue that  the icon should not be used if the inaccessible page does not link  directly to the accessible page.    > 2.

And that's where we need to spend more time working on the  metadata (schema?) to use in conformance claims.      - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I recommend that you consult the HTML Activity  home page (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp) for information about   the appropriate discussion forums. This mailing list is   for discussion in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  Working Group.    Now, to answer your question, there are at least a few ways to  include HTML content in other HTML content:    1) Server side includes. Your server documentation will explain how.  2) In HTML 4, the OBJECT [1] and IFRAME [2] elements.      You should verify whether the browsers you intend to use     support these features of HTML 4.  3) Frames.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.3  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/frames.html#h-16.5    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs    attached mail follows:  Dear Sirs and Madams:    Is there an tag (or object or behavior) in HTML 4.0, 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 that  allows a web page to include the contents of another page in itself.  i.e.,  similar to Microsoft Frontpage's "Include" web bot?

      Hello,    Checkpoint 5.8 of the 10 June guidelines reads:        5.8 Follow operating system conventions that affect           accessibility. In particular, follow conventions           for user interface design, keyboard configuration,           product installation, and documentation.     I propose changing the word "affect" to "benefit". I would  like to avoid this scenario: "I followed OS conventions  as required by checkpoint 5.8; I'm sorry that those conventions  are not accesible." In short, developers should only adopt  the conventions that affect accessibility positively.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000610  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Any element, attribute, or style property (not just proprietary).

      12 October 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs, Gregory Rosmaita,    Mickey Quenzer, David Poehlman, Kitch Barnicle, Eric Hansen,   Charles McCathieNevile, Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets: Tim Lacy, Jim Allan, Harvey Bingham    Absent: Denis Anson    Next meeting: 19 October    Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0062.html  Minutes of previous meeting 10 October:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0055.html    Announcements        1.FTF meeting update and call for participation          MQ: I will probably attend by phone due to costs.        DP: I'll be commuting from my house every day and            have room to put someone up.        JG: We have 9 confirmed (three by phone),             3 regrets, and 3 maybes.        DP: Are there any people we haven't heard from?        JG: Rich and Denis.        DP: Will AOL participate?        JG: No confirmation yet.        MQ: I'll talk to someone from VidPie.                    Resolved: No objections to having a meeting with 9 people.         2.Review list of invited last call reviewers        http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/09/reviewers-last-call-2.html           JG: Still looking for multimedia companies.    Discussion        2.Proposed Simplification of Checkpoint 8.7         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0060.html        Resolved: Adopt proposal.         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0060.html        8. Delete G9          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0070.html        Resolved:         - Move 9.1 to G4        - Move 9.2, 9.3 to G8        - Recycle G9 prose        9. Delete document source          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0072.html           GR: I think that people might have an easier time understanding      "document source view".         EH: One possibility is to say in the document object view      definition that people may call this a "document source view".        MQ: Perhaps too close to "document object model".        IJ: I would argue that fewer terms will make it easier to use.       CMN: Given that "view source" and "show source" is a well-known          name of a feature, I recommend with not defining it and          leaving it there.        IJ: What's the difference between document source view and          document object view?       CMN: The document object is constructed from the source.          The common understanding is that source view means           what came over the wire.        EH: I think that with "document source view" in the UA Guidelines,          there's a conceptual mismatch between checkpoint and the          Note. The Note talks about source, the checkpoint talks about          document object.        IJ: Document object includes source.        IJ: Another proposal is to just use "document object view"         and talk about variance (e.g., from doc source to more than         that).        EH: And say that there is value in providing a view of the source.           Resolved:             - Leave "document source view" in 2.1 and in glossary        - Add to definition of "document source" that it's a subset of          the "document object".        3.Definition of User Agent         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0058.html        Amended:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0065.html          GR: There's a difference between a composite user agent and        one that conforms natively.          DP: Works for me. Makes the guidelines easier to use.          GR: All the components of a composite claim must meet the        requirements that apply to it.           /* Discussion that claims are made about a collection of things */             Resolved will dissent from GR and MQ:         - Accept proposal and amended proposal            http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0058.html            http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0065.html        4.Scope, Intro, Inside/Outside Analysis         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0034.html         IJ: Summarizes EH's proposal, and EH and IJ prioritization           of some topics.         MQ: My problem with a list of things we aren't going to talk           about is that some people may feel left out.         DP: Fix that by pointing those readers to relevant sources           of information.         GR: On the assumption that we're dealing with WCAG-conformant           content: people have not been waiting for this after three           year.        CMN: I don't think that this document assumes in all cases            WCAG-conformant content.          GR: The UA needs to override shortcomings.         JG: Most of the checkpoints don't depend on WCAG, but we           built some of them based on WCAG requirements.        CMN: Does it hurt us to put in "dependency on WCAG-conformance           client"?         GR: The first principle is do no harm.            EH: I think that we have made a number of assumptions along the           way in order to make the scope of the document manageable           as well as to meet accessibility requirements. If we don't           state that we expect WCAG-conformant content, then it opens           the floodgates of potential repair issues. It makes us           more responsible for repairing bad authoring. I think there           are valid reasons not to tackle that.         IJ: We have not emphasized repair functionalities.        CMN: I think that it's not true that we've avoided repair           in content.         GR: Document not useful if it expects all conformant content.        CMN: To say that this document assumes wcag-conformant content           will undermine its credibility.         IJ: I propose:          - Designed with some WCAG requirements in mind            (to promote authoring of conformant content).          - Looks forward (e.g., conformance to specs required)          - There are some repair requirements built-in.        CMN: I think this is editorial...         EH: Are we satisfied with the amount of repair that we           have in this document?          DP: I'm hesitant to soften the wcag language because we           want to promote wcag-conformant content.         Resolved to add scope prose along the lines of:          - Designed with some WCAG requirements in mind            (to promote authoring of conformant content).          - Looks forward (e.g., conformance to specs required)          - There are some repair requirements built-in, and            techniques as well.         Who has read the 29 Sep draft: IJ, CMN, JG, EH, DP.         Resolved: Editors will filter out editorial proposals in:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0034.html         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0038.html        5.Repair Text, Definitions, Etc.         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0045.html        Resolved:         - Adopt EH's 1.5 wording.         - Repair content could be in the DOM, but not required. No           statements about whether DOM repaired before-load/after-load           etc. [         - Adopt suggestion 4 (2.6: do not generate repair text).         - Add support, implement, and conform to the glossary.        GR: I think that 2.6 should include a requirement to generate          repair content when configured to do so.        DP: If the author specified empty alt, then there may be          something behind it.        Resolved:         - Add configuration requirement to 2.6 so that the           UA generates repair text ? la checkpoint 2.5. (repair).        6.Conformance Claim and keyboard API support         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0028.html           RS: Due to target of this document, no problem with this.         CMN: I don't see that this is necessary.          Resolved:          - Even if there isn't a standard system keyboard API,             the subject must implement some keyboard API.          Action CMN: Send comments about whether a keyboard API            always necessary.        7.Revised Abstract         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0032.html    Other proposals:       10. APIs standard?          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0078.html    Decision to go to last call:       IJ: Note that Tim Lacy has already agreed to go to last call.                Agreed: CMN, EH, DP, KB, GR (with reservations but don't want        to hold up the process), JG, RS, IJ, MQ.       Resolved: The WG agrees to go to last call with modifications        to the 29 September draft indicated above.    Completed Action Items        1.IJ: Propose text for a note explaining the implementation issues       related to providing user agent generated content through the DOM        Status: Done in techniques document, but I will check.        4.JG: Talk to Ian about adding a column to the impact matrix for       supporting authors in creating accessible content        GR: Most authoring tools let you look at sample rendering.      EH: Sounds like validation and repair. We don't have much about          that today.       IJ: I think that impact matrix should only say "this checkpoint          is meant for this type of disability".        Status: Dropped.    Open Action Items        2.KB: Submit technique on providing information on current item and       number of items in search        Status: Not done.        3.RS: Send information (if you can) about tagging for information  for       improving performance        Status: Unknown.        5.EH: Will propose text to be added to the guidelines document to       discuss the scope and the limitations of the current document        Status: Done.         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0034.html         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0038.html        6.TL: Check with Microsoft Multi-media group to find a reviewer        Status: Unknown.        7.TL: Check to see if MS can send representative to FTF meeting        Status: Unknown.        8.GR: Contacts for Dolphin for reviewing UAAG.

      Hello,    Al's comments below suggest both that (a) the current checkpoint 7.6  may not provide adequate navigation support to the user and that   (b) without additional study of the problem, he would not feel   comfortable offering an alternative. [Al, please correct me if  I've misstated these points.]    Based on these comments, here are some ways of moving forward:    1) Leave the checkpoint as is. Add commentary to the     techniques document (e.g., based on what Al has written)      to give developers a clear sense of what users     need, even if the checkpoint is only about element types.    2) Lower the priority of the checkpoint to a P3. Rationale: if the     checkpoint is not known to lower important barriers to access     as written, but is likely to improve accessibility, then it should     only be a P3 checkpoint.    3) Delete the checkpoint.    Al's comments suggest that his expectations about what the user  needs may not be easily turned into an algorithm ready-made   for developers, without further study. I do not have an alternative   checkpoint to propose at this time.     - Ian    Al Gilman wrote:  >   > The text of checkpoint 7.6 now reads, with link numbers inserted:  >   >    7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important  >           structural elements identified by the author.

We attempt to emphasize that good design produces accessible documents,  thus I don't think there's a conflict. However, if the tone leans  towards accessibility, I think that's to be expected from this document.

I'm not sure what you mean by strategies. Could you be more specific?  The prose at the beginning of section A discusses general  principles (these are not exactly strategies, admittedly) and the  checkpoints themselves are strategies for addressing the  guidelines. Perhaps a more implementation-oriented discussion  of strategies belongs in the techniques document. Any suggestions  are appreciated.    > Perhaps a brief discussion of the  > common use-cases would help: How a user with blindness typically browses the  > web, and the same for users with hearing, cognitive, language impairments.  > Many authors and designers have little or no understanding of the current  > state of affairs in these cases.

The Working Group has strong reservations about making  such a statement because of the difficulties raised by  alternative pages (see the Note after the checkpoints  in Guideline 13). Furthermore, the Working Group feels  that the checkpoint about alternative pages (13.5) should  be listed *after* the others of that guideline despite  the fact that it is a priority 1 checkpoint in order to  dissuade authors from using this solution as a first  option. Authors should attempt to make their pages  accessible, not separate but equal.     > Running through the document start to end:  >   > section:  Introduction  >   > *       Intro section describing use of alt text as a benefit to users with  > blindness:  >         This would benefit from mention of screen readers or similar  > technology.

Checkpoint 15.1 does not refer to the use of "title" as  a means of a creating a tool tip. Checkpoint 15.1 talks  about link phrases, which should be understandable out  of context, terse, meaningful, and device-independent.    The "title" attribute in HTML should be used to give advisory  information about the target of a link. This information  MAY be used as a tool-tip by a user agent, but this is  not required in any W3C specification.     Do users need to be told that it's possible to interact  with a Web document? Isn't that so fundamental to the   Web that it's not necessary to state for every link  that this link is meant to be interacted with?    > *       Further down, bullet "Why certain pages are inaccessible".  > Interesting word choice - "inaccessible" seems a bit strong and sounds like  > a 404 synonym.

Eric Hansen has sent some interesting suggestions [1]  about the conformance section that the Working Group  has not yet had the opportunity to review. I trust that  some of your questions will be addressed during that review.

It is interesting that you are associating the term "transformation" so  strongly with "style sheets". Does that connection come  from an XSL perspective?    Style sheets provide some of the solutions listed in the  guidelines, but others rely on proper use of markup,  organization of content and of an entire site, navigation  tools, etc.     >  Some additional  > verbiage about or references to typical accessories that are used to enhance  > accessibility (such as screen readers) would probably help many designers  > who are less familiar with these issues (the link to the Braille display  > definition is a good example).

However, we will look further into a discussion of CSS2's aural  cascading style sheets and how they can control cueing, background  sounds, etc. The editors will also look into more information about  synchronization and SMIL.     > *       Guideline 5 seems to be in conflict with the goal of supporting  > users with downlevel browsers.

Not much we can do here, except note the conflict (as is done in  > the techniques doc).    Yes, the conflict must be clearly documented. We will also re-examine  checkpoint 13.1, which says to use the latest W3C technologies.   The phrase "wherever possible" must be clarified. It may be more  appropriate to use CSS1 features, for example, than some CSS2 features  until CSS2 is more widely supported. It is crucial for authors  to ensure that whatever features they use transform gracefully,  and style sheets are designed to do so.     > *       Guideline 5.6 says "Use relative rather than absolute units in  > markup language attribute values ..." and then the techniques document says  > in the layout section below "Layout, positioning, layering, and alignment  > should be done through style sheets (notably by using CSS floats and  > absolute positioning)".  Guideline 5.6 should perhaps be clarified to except  > positioning attributes.    As confusing as it may sound, CSS allows you to  use relative units in absolute positioning (and you should).   Thus, you may position an image to be offset by "3em" from  the top of its containing element. This is a fixed distance,  but is relative to the current font size, so it scales  nicely.    Thus, relative "units" should be used wherever possible.

Gregory,    The Working Group resolved at the 17 August teleconference   (refer to summary from Chair [1]) to accept the proposal to  allow claims of conformance for software used in tandem provided  that all components be identified.    Also, per the same resolution to issue 294, the following   text about the importance of accessibility by default  appears in the 29 September Guidelines [3], section 3.2:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  User agent developers are strongly encouraged to design software that  conforms in the default configuration. Users may not be able to  install complementary software because the default configuration does  not allow it easily (e.g., the mechanisms for retrieving and  installing plug-ins are not accessible by default), because they don't  have access privileges on a public computer, etc. In order for people  to use the software at all, the installation procedure (and any  subsequent software update procedures) must be accessible according to  the guidelines of this document. For example, the software must  provide device-independent access and accessible documentation of the  installation.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    For previous discussions on accessible installation, refer to:     1) Minutes of 10 December 1999 IBM face to face meeting [4]   2) Deletion of explicit mention of "installation, documentation,      UI configuration" from checkpoint 1.1 per resolution of       31 August teleconference [5] (there were no subsequent      objections on the list).    The following text appears in section 1.2 of the 29 September  draft:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  The user agent installation procedure needs to be accessible  otherwise the user will not be able to use it at all.   Most of the requirements in this document should be adopted for the  installation procedure to ensure its accessibility.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    Recall also that installation according to system conventions  is covered by checkpoint 5.8.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0267.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0244.html  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000929/  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991210#issue-147  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0341.html        > on 9 august 2000, you asked,  >   > quote  > What's the difference between installing from the Web and installing from a CD?  > unquote  >   > none--both need to follow the applicable accessibility guidelines (WCAG for  > web-based download (as well as download-and-install) interfaces, and the  > pertinent platform or language guidelines for software developers cited in  > the UAAG (and ATAG) Techniques document....  >   > ian also observed:  >   > quote  > 3) Jon Gunderson and others have pointed out that users cannot always  > install new software or features or modules (e.g., when they work in a  > public environment such as a library).

      (Quoted from Wendy):    I think the checkpoints for scripts ought to read like this:    1. Ensure your page is usable without scripts. P1.      If you cannot make the page usable without scripts,      provide an equivalent mechanism to provide the     function of the script.    2. Ensure that elements with scripting events are keyboard operable.  P1     (i.e. directly accessible so maybe a P2 if #1 is satisfied).      3. We probably don't need text equivalents for scripts     other than those that have some purely visual impact.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

Why do you say that the user agent has attached the behavior? The  definition says that what is active is determined by content, not  the author. If the user agent implements the navigable outline view  in HTML, then HTML links define the behavior. What is the format  that the user agent is using to implement this outline view? Where  does the user agent store the fact that selecting a particular  entry links to an original location in the document? In this case,  the user agent is the author of the content, but the content still  is where the user agent (as user agent now, no longer as generator  of content) locates the linking semantics.     - Ian     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

IJ: Before answering that question, there is a general question you  could ask, which is: "Will the User Agent Guidelines address  the "Until user agent..." clauses from WCAG 1.0?" The answer  is yes. In particular, we have reviewed these relationships  closely and feel that UAGL now addresses all of these dependencies.  Refer to [1] for the results of this review.    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0090.html     Your question raises a subtle point: what's the different  between making content accessible and providing access to content?  I'll have to think more about this, but my first reaction is:     a) Making content accessible refers to how the content is rendered   b) Providing access to content refers to the ability to get at the      bits.    At least that's my understanding, although this undoubtedly needs  to be clarified.     ISSUE: I would like to discuss a need for clarification here         on a teleconference.    > Is there a list somewhere of what user agents and their associated dependent >user agents  (e.g. screen readers) already satisfy [1] so that "until" is really >no  longer needed?    IJ: Yes, [2].    Unfortunately, it's still empty, but we are working with  developers to get help filling it out. The WCAG WG is  actively pursuing this now.    [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support       > My particular user agent/dependent user agent combination currently does meet some but not  other aspects, of [2].

(i.e. I hear  "Left bracket one  right bracket" followed by the text of the link spoken.  > In the case of informing of the existence of a heading, my screen reader does not do this in  combination with either IE401 or Lynx.

IJ: Very tricky!    > And, when it comes to tables...well I could go on about that for a long time.  Suffice it to  say both the WCAG and UAG documents describe behavior that is as far as  I know not present in  any existing screen reader/browser combination.    IJ: We are aware of this.

We need technical input about how   user agents communicate. We need suggestions for how user agents  could best handle commonly encountered browsing scenarios that  frustrate users.

      WAI GL Teleconference  March 17, 1999    Attendees:  Gregg Vanderheiden  Wendy Chisholm  Charles McCathie Nevile  Greg Lowney  Chuck Letourneau (Scribe)  Judy Brewer  Jason White  Daniel Dardailler  Al Gilman  Ian Jacobs (late)    [CL's minutes edited by Ian]    Reference document [1]  [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226       JW: how do we address the official responses to strictly editorial  comments.    GV: the editors can make the changes based on their initiative, and  the WG can comment on the changes if we don't agree otherwise, stet.    ------------------  Greg Lowney's issues [2]    [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0322.html    Issue 2. Priority of check points related to color.     Resolved for checkpoint 4.2:   a) For images make color contrast apriortiy 2.    b) Textual elements and things that can be controlled by UA's are  priority 3.      Issue 3. Accessibility of Lists.   For checkpoint 5.2, Ian indicated that the wording had changed:       Mark up lists and list items properly    GL: agreed that the new wording met his expectations.  Resolved: with the new wording is ok.    Issue 4. Priority (currently 2) of 5.3: Don't use blockquote for           indentation.    GL: decided that his comments was philosophical and not to be argued  over.    Question: is the widespread misuse of blockquote a serious  accessibility problem?    Resolved: Leave the priority as 2, but make the examples of Q and  Blockquote much more useful.    Dissention: Greg Lowney feels that it should be priority 3.    GL: suggested adding to example "this is important because braille  translators, speech synthesizers, etc."    JB: nominates that Jason to make the example and sent to list.    Issue 5. Checkpoint 15.1, use of "title" in link elements.   Suggesting that there should be some guidance on how to properly use  "title".    Resolved: Change wording of 15.1 to something like:          Clearly identify the target of each link.    Resolved: Add to checkpoint:       a) A link must make clear where it's going in text.     b) Anchor content gets higher priority, but "title" can be used to       add additional information.    c) Use "title" to distinguing link that use the same link text.         Issue 6. Checkpoint 13.1: Use latest W3C specification where  applicable and supported.    Proposed: Drop "If W3C technologies are used".  Resolved wording:        Use applicable w3c technologies and the latest version of        specification where supported.       Edited to: Use W3C technologies and use the latest                 versions when they are supported.    Issue 7. Ian thinks a similar change can be made to 13.2  Resolved: Change wording of 13.2 to:       Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies    Issue 8. Priority (currently 2) of Checkpoint 14.5:            Make long lists in groups.  Accessibility or usability issue?  It is a judjegment call on the editorial content.  Al views it as P3. CMN views it as P2. GL: thinks it is P3.  Consensus for P3.   With CMN dissenting for P2.    IJ: should we then reconsider 14.? Which specifies grouping of list  items in a form.    Resolved: Merge 14.3 and 14.5. (priority 2)  Proposed text:          Divide large amounts of information into manageable        groups where natural and appropriate.     ------------------  Eric Hansen's conformance proposal [3]    [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0295.html    Issue 1. Conformance scope: What is conforming must be identified.    Resolved: The WG agreed that a statement of scope, written in natural  language, was needed.     There are two issues: the wider level of conformance of other  guidelines or policies to the W3C specification, and micro-level  conformance of individual pages or xxx to the checkpoints.    /* Question from Ian: To address this resolution,      was there an action item assigned? Was it assigned to Judy? */

I would use the same argument for  > P2 as the group used to make documentation conformance a P2 level.    I would object to that. Here are some reasons:     - I'm not convinced you can create a document that      conforms to WCAG 1.0 at Level Double-A with plain text.     For instance, you might fail 3.3: use style sheets to     control layout and presentation. Or 3.6: Mark up lists     and list items properly. Or most importantly, 11.1:     Use w3c technologies when they are available and      appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when     supported.       This means that Notepad couldn't conform to UAAG 1.0     if it only supports plain text viewing.     - By imposing a P2 requirement here, were are in effect saying     that all content on the Web must be level Double-A conformant.     Otherwise, no user agent will be able to conform to UAAG 1.0.     I don't believe we should impose that restriction on authors     or user agent developers.     - Ian       > At 01:50 PM 12/27/2000 -0500, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Hello,  > >  > >Per my action from the 16 November face-to-face meeting [1],  > >please consider this proposed change to checkpoint 6.2.  > >  > > >From the 23 October draft [2]:  > >  > >   6.2 Use and conform to W3C Recommendations when they are  > >       available and appropriate for a task.

Yes, I agree that there might be several ways to skin cats in the  pursuit  of the goal of identifying when one has satisfied a checkpoint. Where  possible, we should identify a minimal requirement. Otherwise, giving  a sample and readily achievable technique is a good idea.     > Certainly in the case of Guideline 2.1, the idea of a property sheet for  > the current object is something that seems easy to do, and seems to satisfy  > the guideline.

      Hello,    I ran into Aaron here at the Sonesta hotel, and pursued the  question of animation control for a few minutes. Aaron pointed  me to the following resources:    1) The 'speed' attribute is defined in section 11.1.3 of the      time manipulation module of SMIL 2.0 [1].       The attribute defines the playback speed of element time.     Values can be negative, for playback in reverse. This suggests     that fast forward and reverse are also possible.    2) IE 5.5 may already implement this attribute (not absolutely sure,      but they do implement the accelerate and decelerate attributes).    3) One could specify "speed=.5" on the root time container element     and slow down a whole document by half. Or one could do this on     an element-by-element basis.    4) I'm not aware of players that let you do this today through the     user interface.    So, this is starting to suggest to me our requirements for animation  control are covered by the SMIL 2.0 spec.     - Ian    [1]  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil20-20000921/smil-timemanip.html#TimeManip-accelerateSyntax    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Suzette,    We don't use these fonts. In fact, our technical reports  don't use any fonts other than the CSS default fonts  (sans-serif and monospace). Therefore, I believe it's the  mapping from those fonts to your client's fonts that's  causing the problem.     - Ian      > Suzette Ballew  > Netheartbeat, Inc.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The set of active elements (always based on content) may be reduced   by the state of user interaction with the document.    Note that in the future, users may be able to specify behaviors  through style sheet-like content, I assume allowing them  to override author-specified behaviors or to simply add their  own. But this would still be content.    > One ambiguity is that it is hard to tell how you are using the term "active"  > in this description.

We don't use the term "active" in the document to mean that  an element is in its active state. I am comfortable adding that  clarification to the definition.    However, if you think that that the term "active element" might  be confusing, we might use "interactive element" instead.     PROPOSED: Change "active element" to "interactive element".     > Also, from the description it is not clear why the notion of "applicability"  > is relevant.    As usual, this is about what the user agent can recognize. While  this principle is globally relevant and defined in the section  on applicability, I don't think it hurts to remind people in critical  places that "what is X" depends on whether X can be recognized.  So I mention that being an active element is a "role" that is  subject to applicability (since one of the applicabilitly provisions  refers to recognizing the role of content).     - Ian     > > -----Original Message-----  > > From: Ian Jacobs [mailto:ij@w3.org]  > > Sent: Thursday, January 25, 2001 7:34 PM  > > To: w3c-wai-ua@w3.org  > > Subject: Clarifications to definition of "active element"  > >  > >  > > Hello,  > >  > > Based on some comments from Eric, I've attempted to clarify  > > the definition of active element.

IJ: I'm ok with saying the following in the document:     a) This document assumes WCAG conformant content   b) This document deals mostly with scenarios that are not error  scenarios   c) This document includes a couple of repair requirements, but in  general      leaves that work to the Evaluation and Repair Working Group. (I  think      that this document should promote conformance to specs).    I don't think we should talk about what repair techniques we don't cover  since (a) that's a very large realm and (b) we don't do a lot of stuff,  so why focus on the repair techniques that we don't do?    > I think that a recent telecon that we decided that  > >we would not specify which repair functions that user agents could or  > >should do at load-time but that we would only be concerned with repairs  > >made after that point.

I could be persuaded otherwise perhaps.    IJ: I think that's my preference also, but when we discussed it, there  was  no consensus. I don't know whether that's my definitive preference,  either.

One option in addition to Braille is that the full collated  text transcript may be used as the basis of an auditory equivalent.

The word conformance is  defined in the America-Heritage Dictionary Third edition   (at least) as a synonym for "conformity", which is defined  to be "action or behavior in correspondence with current  cusoms, rules, or styles". In the standards world, I think  the word "conformance" is used frequently. For instance,  a number of IETF drafts use this term as well (e.g.,  RFC 2049: "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part   Five: Conformance Criteria and Examples".    In my opinion, the verbs "to conform" and "to comply" mean  almost the same thing in the realm of standards.     - Ian     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Speech label missing 4.15, 4.16, 8.2 and 8.3    Jon,    As I think about it, I think the following checkpoints apply  to all user agents (whatever the content type rendered): 4.16, 4.17,  8.2, and 8.3 (details below). Checkpoints 4.16 and 4.17 are about  selection and focus (which are independent of content type). Checkpoints  8.2 and 8.3 are about links (which are also independent of content  type). Therefore, I think these checkpoints should be removed from  all content type label sets since they apply to all UAs. I think   (but am not absolutely sure) that the way the checkpoints are   written, they already take into account applicability (e.g., they  say "for graphical user agents...").     _ Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000929/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783      Checkpoints 4.16, 4.17, 8.2, and 8.3:    4.16 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted       (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).

      Sean,    Thanks for doing this! We are still working on the requirements  for well-formed claims, in particular to allow for increased  granularity. For example, I think it will be possible (required?)  to indicate the format that is used to satisfy a particular  content type label's requirements (e.g., to satisfy "Image"   requirements, the user agent implements GIF, PNG, and SVG).    I like the use of rdfs:comment. That will also be important  for checkpoints that the claimant says do not apply (for  rationale).    WCAG 1.0? We require that one version of a claim   conforms to WCAG 1.0 (this is not quite what the last  call draft says, but refer to proposal [1], section 15).  A machine-readable claim such as one in N3 probably does  not conform to WCAG 1.0, but is very useful (and probably  sufficient). Do you have any comment on the accessibility  of N3 claims?    In our conformance section, should we start pointing  to EARL as a format for making claims?     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0074    "Sean B.

      Hello,    Tantek ?elik and I spent eight hours on 22 April reviewing the 9  April 2001 (last call) draft of UAAG 1.0. [1]. Tantek develops IE  for the Mac and participates in the W3C CSS Working Group. Tantek  and I last reviewed UAAG 1.0 together in early July 2000 (see  notes [2], [3]). I am very pleased to report that Tantek found  the 9 April draft much improved, and we encountered few issues  and ambiguities that I would consider substantial. Tantek also  had some great ideas for improving the usability of the document  (which he claims to have come up with after reading WCAG 1.0, so  there was lots of mutual patting on the back <wink>).    The issues below are not formal last call issues raised by  Tantek. The bulk of the comments come from Tantek, but this is my  own presentation (and filtering) of the discussion. I have also  included some comments from me that are related to the discussion  or are the result of further reflection.    This is the first of three emails:     1) Part one is the most important issues   2) Part two is about minor clarifications   3) Part three is about good ideas to improve the usability      of the document.    I have not reported editorial issues, which I will simply correct  for the next draft.    Many thanks to Tantek for taking the time to scrutinize the  document!     - Ian    P.S. Tantek did not sign off on this email or the other two. He  said he trusted me to communicate our conversation to the  Working Group.    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-UAAG10-20010409/  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0060  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0068    ================================  1) Checkpoint 1.2: "Start" events are more important than "End"      events.  ================================    Many input device events in today's systems are designed as  start/end pairs. Examples include: mousedown/mouseup,  mouseover/mouseout, and key down/up. These events are (to my  understanding) always expected to happen in pairs.  Tantek made  the point that designers therefore make assumptions that an "end"  handler will not be executed without execution of a preceding  "start" handler. Checkpoint 1.2 as written breaks this model.    --------  Proposal  --------    Narrow checkpoint 1.2 so that the list of handlers that the user  agent makes available may vary according to different states. In  particular, the user agent should not be required to allow the  user to trigger an "end" handler prior to execution of the  corresponding "start" handler. Similarly, the user agent should  probably not allow the user to trigger another start handler  until the preceding end handler of the same type has been  triggered.     Summary: The user agent should only have to support the sequences  that are available to the user of the native input device (e.g.,  mouse).    There would probably need to be some changes to checkpoint 9.4 as  well, at least to clarify that the "list of available handlers"  may not be the full list due to the current state of interaction  (i.e., you may only get start handlers, not end handlers).    A technique idea: Allow the user to trigger two "start" handlers  in a row (of the same type) and trigger the intervening "end"  handler automatically just before the second "start" handler.    ========================================  2) Checkpoint 2.1: Do some UAAG 1.0 requirements override this?  ========================================    Checkpoint 2.1 says "render according to spec". However, some of  the requirements in Guideline 3 (and possibly others) require  control of rendering that may not be part of a specification or  may even "contradict" a specification. [Al Gilman has said that  if a W3C specification does not allow the type of control  required by Guideline 3, it is broken. But UAAG 1.0 is not just  for user agents rendering content authored using W3C  specifications.]    --------  Proposal  --------    State clearly in checkpoint 2.1 that for other rendering  requirements elsewhere in the document:     a) If the format spec explains how to provide the       control we require, follow the spec.     b) If the required control does not contradict the      format specification, there is no problem implementing      the required control features. [The fact that the       specificatino says nothing does not mean that the       additional control requirements of UAAG 1.0 do not apply!]     c) If the required control does contradict the format      specification, it is acceptable to violate 2.1 in order to      satisfy the other rendering requirements of UAAG 1.0.         I don't think that the other direction should be permissible:      the UA should not be permitted to conform to UAAG 1.0 by      satisfying 2.1 and by not satisfying the other rendering      requirements.  I would guess that in this case, the format      spec probably doesn't satisfy the requirements of checkpoint      8.2 as it would seem to prevent the authoring of content that      conforms to WCAG 1.0.    ========================================  3) Checkpoint 2.2: Define text format more formally.  ========================================    Checkpoint 2.2 says that text formats "include at least the  following". This is an unbounded requirement as written.    --------  Proposal  --------    Change checkpoint 2.2 to define exactly what we mean by text  formats for this document (i.e., the minimal requirement).  For  example, change the phrase to "For the purposes of this  checkpoint, text formats are:...".    ========================================  4) Checkpoint 2.3: Scope of "alert" requirement.  ========================================    Checkpoint 2.3 requires the user to "alert the user to the  existence of the [unrendered conditional] content and provide  access to it."    Is the alert requirement global (i.e., "there is conditional  content in this page") or element-level?    If the alert requirement is global, I think that a technique that  is just as good as an alert is the ability to query the document  and ask "Is there conditional content in this page?".    If the alert requirement is element level ("there is conditional  content here") this needs to be clarified.    I would like the Working Group to clarify which is intended.    ========================================  5) Configuration not required when the user agent always or      never does something?  ========================================    Many of the checkpoints involve configuration  requirements. However, configuration may not be necessary if the  user agent always or never provides the critical functionality in  question. We've already incorporated this idea into checkpoint  5.1, which reads:      "5.1 ... Configuration is not required if the current focus can    only ever be moved by explicit user request."    --------  Proposal  --------    Modify the configuration checkpoints as follows:     a) No configuration is necessary if the user agent always provides      the required functionality: 2.3, 2.5       5.4, 5.5: I'm not sure about these two. If it's an extra     effort to confirm a prompt, then maybe configuration is      required.     b) No configuration is necessary if the user agent never      provides the functionality: 5.1, 5.2        For checkpoints 3.2, 3.4, and 3.7, no configuration is      necessary for the placeholder or alert parts (the UA      does the right thing by always providing placeholders in this      case, and always alerting in this case).     c No changes to the following checkpoints (i.e., configuration is     required). In each case, there is a phrase of rationale:       2.4: User may also want automatic rendering.     2.7: User may not want repair text.     2.8: Two options here, so configuration required.       2.9: User may not want automatic rendering.     2.10: User should have access to all content.     3.1: User should have access to all content.     3.2: User may also want automatic rendering.     3.3: Some users may find blinking important or useful          (e.g., users with deafness).     3.4: User should have access to all content.     3.5, 3.6: Automatic behavior also desirable.     3.7: User should have access to all content.     4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.9, 4.11, 4.13, 4.14:           More than one on/off setting required.     5.3: May want automatic opening behavior.     5.6: May want automatic closing behavior.     9.5: May want automatic closing behavior.     9.9: More than one on/off setting required.    10.2, 10.4: More than one on/off setting required.    Guideline 11: More than one on/off setting required.    12.4: Documentation checkpoint (not about configurability).    ================================  6) Checkpoint 2.9: Automatic rendering of all conditional content     at once required?  ========================================    Checkpoint 2.9 reads:      "Allow configuration to render all conditional content    automatically. Provide access to this content according to    format specifications or where unspecified, by applying one of    the following techniques described in checkpoint 2.3: 1a, 2a,    or 1b."    I don't think it's necessary that all conditional content be  rendered automatically in the same viewport at the same time. I  think that it would suffice to have one or more configurations  that allow all conditional content to be rendered automatically  in some viewport at some time. For instance, one setting to  render NOFRAMES content automatically in HTML, another to render  NOSCRIPT content automatically, etc.    --------  Proposal  --------    <NEW 2.9>   Allow configuration to render all conditional content   automatically. Provide access to this content according to   format specifications or where unspecified, by applying one of   the following techniques described in checkpoint 2.3: 1a, 2a, or   1b. The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint by   rendering all conditional content automatically in a single   viewport at one time. The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint   by allowing different configurations to render different types of   conditional content automatically, possibly in different viewports.  </NEW 2.9>    Comments:    - Tantek asked whether alternative style sheets should be  considered conditional content. I didn't think so at first, but  the more I think about it, the more I think they should be  considered conditional content. The definition of conditional  content starts:     "Conditional content is content that, by specification, should   be made available to users through the user interface, generally   under certain conditions (e.g., user preferences or operating   environment limitations)."    Checkpoint 4.16 requires that the user be able to choose from  available author style sheets, which includes alternative style  sheets. I note that the definition says "user interface" rather  than "viewport" specifically (where *content* is rendered).    The proposed change to 2.9 is consistent with providing  alternative style sheets one at a time (instead of all at once,  automatically) as required by 4.16.    ========================================  7) Definitions of rendered content / viewport circular.  ========================================    The current circular definitions say "rendered content is content  available through a viewport" and "the viewport is where the user  agent renders content".    --------  Proposal  --------    <OLD RENDERED CONTENT>  Rendered content is the part of content capable of being  perceived by a user through a given viewport (whether visual,  auditory, or tactile).  </OLD RENDERED CONTENT>    <NEW RENDERED CONTENT>   Rendered content is the part of content that the user agent makes  available to the user's senses of sight, hearing, or touch (and  only those senses for the purposes of UAAG 1.0). Any content that  causes an effect that may be perceived through these senses  constitutes rendered content. This includes text characters,  images, style sheets, scripts, and anything else in content whose  effect when processed may be perceived.  </NEW RENDERED CONTENT>    At first, I was nervous about this model, but I am unable to draw  a line between style sheets, text content, and binary image  formats: they all require processing to create an effect that is  perceived by the senses. It's easiest to say that when they cause  an effect that may be perceived (by some users, but not  necessarily by all), they are rendered content.  Some examples of  content that is generally not rendered: comments. They may be  rendered in the source view.    The only checkpoints that have requirements related to rendered  content are 2.3 and 10.9, and this model is consistent with those  requirements. The definition of "point of regard" refers to  rendered content and is used in 9.3; the usage is also consistent  there.    <NEW VIEWPORT>  The user agent renders content through one or more viewports.   </NEW VIEWPORT>    <OLD VIEWPORT>  The user views rendered content through a viewport.  </OLD VIEWPORT>    Comment: I was thinking about the HTML TITLE element, which most  user agents render in a title bar, separate from the "main"  viewport of the user interface. Should the title bar be  considered a viewport? I think it should. The only checkpoint  that makes me nervous with this approach is 9.1:      "9.1 Allow the user to make the selection and focus of each    viewport (including frames) the current selection and current    focus, respectively."    See the next issue as a way to address this.    ========================================  8) Require focus for enabled elements only. Don't require     selection. Clarify that "user interface focus" is not related     to viewports (but instead to other controls of the user     interface).  ========================================    My discussions with the SVG Working Group, and the previous issue  in this email lead me to the following proposal regarding focus  and selection requirements.    --------  Proposal  --------    - We should explicitly not require user selection for    conformance. I think that stating this explicitly is not a    significant departure from the way that the following checkpoints    involving selection are written: 6.5, 7.1, 9.1, 9.3, 9.7, 10.2,    10.3, 10.8.    - We should explicitly require content and user interface focus    for conformance, but only when there is something to focus on    (either an "enabled element" or a user interface control).    To implement this proposal:    8a) Fix 9.1, which is broken in a number of ways (that are not  really serious):    <NEW 9.1a>  Allow the user to make the selection of each viewport (including  frames) the current selection. For content only.     Note: UAAG 1.0 does not require a conforming user agent to      implement a user selection. The selection requirements of this     document only apply when the user agent implements a selection.  </NEW 9.1a>    <NEW 9.1b>  Implement one content focus for each viewport where  enabled elements are part of the rendered content. Allow the user  to make the content focus of each viewport (including frames) the  current focus. For content only.     Note: UAAG 1.0 assumes that a viewport has at most one content     focus. The requirements of this document should still make     sense for viewports with more than one focus.  </NEW 9.1b>    <NEW 9.1c>  Implement a user interface focus mechanism. Allow the user  to move the user interface focus to any enabled user interface  control. User agent only.  </NEW 9.1c>    Comment on 9.1c: This is like checkpoint 9.2, but for the UI.    8b) Add an applicability provision related to selection:       "A checkpoint (or part of a checkpoint) applies unless any one     of the following conditions is met:"       <NEW CONDITION>     The checkpoint makes requirements about the selection, but the user     agent does not implement a user selection mechanism.     </NEW CONDITION>    8c) Checkpoint 9.3: I think that the "user interface focus"  should *not* be associated with the viewport for any requirements  in the document, including for checkpoint 9.3.  The user  interface focus is set on other controls of the user  interface. Therefore, I think that checkpoint 9.3 should not  include "user interface focus" in the list of state information  that must be part of the *viewport* history.    8d) Change 5.1 so that "current focus" (which includes both  content focus and UI focus) does not refer just to viewports.     <OLD 5.1>   Allow configuration so that the current focus does not move   automatically to viewports that open without explicit user   request.   </OLD 5.1>     <NEW 5.1>   Allow configuration so that the current content focus does not   move automatically to viewports that open without explicit user   request.   </NEW 5.1>      Comment: I'm not sure whether 5.1 *should* include a requirement   about not moving user interface focus. What would the user   agent do in the case of prompts? Would there be a configuration   so that the focus would not move to prompts, e.g., to confirm   a form submission?    8e) Leave 5.2, 10.7 as is.    8f) Fix 10.8. It should be about content only.    8g) Fix definitions of focus, selection, and viewport. In  particular, mention that for UAAG 1.0 there is expected to be  only one of each (but one could imagine an operating environment  or user agent with two focuses per viewport, etc.).    ================================  9) Checkpoint 2.10: Is this only about natural language? Or is  this also about scripts?  ================================    Checkpoint 2.10 reads:      "Allow configuration not to render content in unsupported    natural languages."    --------  Proposal  --------    I think this requirement needs to mention unsupported scripts  (writing systems) explicitly.    <NEW 2.10>  "Allow configuration not to render content in unsupported natural  languages and scripts (writing systems)."  </NEW 2.10>    ================================  10) Checkpoint 4.1: Is access to very small fonts a P1  requirement?  ================================    I think it's a P1 requirement to increase the text size (for  users with low vision). I don't think it's a P1 requirement to  shrink the text size to an arbitrarily small value. Gregory has  said in the past that very small fonts allow him to fit more  content on a page and reduce scrolling. But that's not a P1 issue  (that's more like a P3 issue). An analogy: checkpoint 4.4 only  requires slowing of presentations, not speeding up, which we did  not consider a P1 requirement.    --------  Proposal  --------    <OLD part of 4.1>  Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font sizes  supported by the operating environment.   </OLD part of 4.1>    <NEW part of 4.1>  Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font sizes  above 9 pixels supported by the operating environment.   </NEW part of 4.1>    ================================  11) Checkpoint 4.9: Clarification that global volume control is for  content and user agent sounds.  ================================    Checkpoint 4.9 starts:     "Allow global configuration and control of the volume of all   audio, with an option to override audio volumes specified by the   author or user agent defaults."    --------  Proposed  --------    The user agent may satisfy this requirement by providing a single  control over all sounds, whether they come from content or the  user interface. Distinct volume control for content as opposed to  UI is not required.    Clarify that the global system volume would satisfy this  checkpoint (a little stronger than the current Note).    ================================  12) Checkpoint 4.10: P1 for non-style, P2 for style  ================================    Checkpoint 4.10 reads:      "Allow independent control of the volumes of distinct audio    sources synchronized to play simultaneously."    --------  Proposed  --------    12a) For consistency with checkpoints 4.4 and 4.5, checkpoint 4.10     should include the following statement:       "The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for     audio whose recognized role is to create a purely stylistic     effect."    12b) There should be a new P2 checkpoint for volume control      of other audio content.    ================================  13) Checkpoint 6.4: Not always obvious to distinguish access      from a Web page from plug-in access.  ================================    Tantek had the same reaction as the AOL reviewers [4] that 6.4 as  written may pose some security risks (write access to all user  interface controls). I suggested that access for plug-ins should  be provided, but not for authors (from Web pages). He said that  it's not always easy (or possible?) to distinguish the two,  notably in the javascript case.  I don't know how to address this  one and need developer input.    [4]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0068    ================================  14) Checkpoint 7.3: What if OS conventions are inferior to what      the user agent developer would implement?  ================================    "What if I can do better than the standard or convention?"  has  been a recurring comment on all of our checkpoints that involve  following conventions, including:      6.4, 6.5, 6.6:      Standard APIs    7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4: Operating environment conventions      There may be others as well (e.g., 8.1).    Jon commented on this in a recent email [5]:      "My main concern is that we want to reduce the reliance on    proprietary or special solutions for individual assistive    technologies, since this will make it harder for developers to    make their software accessible and a smaller number of    assistive technologies may be supported."      [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0070    The argument for conventions is predictability and  interoperability. Our checkpoint 7.3 is a Priority 2, since not  following conventions doesn't necessarily make access impossible.  I find compelling the AOL [4] suggestion that is consistent with  this that it's a P1 requirement to make it work, and a P2  requirement to follow standards and conventions.    I hope we will have further discussion on this topic so that we  can establish a consistent model in the document, and where there  are exceptions, we have rationale to back them up.    ================================  15) Definition of "non-interactive element",       checkpoints 9.2 and 9.6  ================================    Tantek did not like the definition of "disabled" element as any  element that is not enabled. This means that a paragraph of text,  which might never be enabled in any session, would be considered  a disabled element.    Instead, he proposed adding a definition of "non-interactive  element". Please consider this definition:      "A non-interactive element is piece of content that, by    specification, is not expected to be an enabled element in    any user session."    The definition of disabled element would become:      "A disabled element is an element that is not enabled     in the current user session but could be in some user     session."    Non-interactive elements might be enabled in some sessions  because of how the user agent chooses to handle them.    The following checkpoints would be changed accordingly:    <OLD 9.2>  The user agent may also include disabled elements in the  navigation order.  </OLD 9.2>    <NEW 9.2>  The user agent may also include disabled and non-interactive  elements in the navigation order.  </NEW 9.2>    <OLD 9.6>  The user agent must not include disabled elements in the  navigation order.  </OLD 9.6>    <NEW 9.6>  The user agent must not include disabled elements or   interactive elements in the navigation order.  </NEW 9.6>    ================================  16) Checkpoint 9.5: Moving focus without triggering handlers      may be wrong.  ================================    Tantek argued that:     a) If there are no focus handlers on a page, this is not necessary.   b) If there are no focus handlers on a page, not firing them      may break the page.    We did not discuss the technical feasibility, only whether it was  a good idea at all.    This functionality (like others in our document) does not  guarantee access, and it may even break some pages. Still, it may  enable access in some cases where access would not otherwise be  possible. Perhaps the best approach is to get more experience  with implementations of this checkpoint and see if it's actually  usage.    A good place to start is to design a test case where we think  that not firing an onfocus handler automatically would improve  access (in conjunction with the other checkpoints for manual  firing).    ================================  17) Checkpoint 10.1: "Purpose of table" is vague.  ================================    Tantek found the phrase "purpose of each table" to be too  vague. Perhaps we should add a parenthetical such as   "(e.g., as expressed in a summary or caption)".    ================================  18) Checkpoint 10.3: What is relationship between black and      white, and color?  ================================    This checkpoint reads:        "10.3 Ensure that all of the default highlight styles for the    selection, content focus, enabled elements, recently visited    links, and fee links (1) do not rely on color alone, and (2)    differ from each other, and not by color alone."    What if the content is being rendered in black and white (or more  likely, different pieces of content are being rendered in  different shades of grey)? This checkpoint is designed so that  users with some color deficiencies can hope to distinguish  selection from focus, etc. by default. Can users with color  deficiencies distinguish black from grey?  (Obviously, it would  be hard for anyone to distinguish two similar shades of grey.  We  don't talk about "contrast" in any of the checkpoints, because we  don't have any requirements that rely on color by default.)    I don't know whether "greying out" disabled elements would be  considered a sufficient mechanism for distinguishing, for  example, "enabled" from "disabled" elements. Similarly, is a  "bold" font distinguishable from "regular" font?    --------  Proposal  --------    State explicitly in the Techniques document that "greying" alone  is considered an effect that relies on color.    Comment: I do not have the technical expertise to back up this  statement, since I'm not a color expert (or a low vision  expert). However, I think that this question reveals that our  requirements stop at "color" and don't get into issues of  contrast, saturation, hue, etc. Information at "The Lighthouse"  about color contrast [6] suggests, however, that the above  statement is on the right track. Here's a quote:       "Don't assume that the lightness you perceive will be the same     as the lightness perceived by people with color deficits. You     can generally assume that they will see less contrast between     colors than you will. If you lighten your light colors and     darken your dark colors, you will increase the visual     accessibility of your design."       [6] http://www.lighthouse.org/color_contrast.htm    =======================================================  19) Checkpoints 10.2, 10.4, 10.7: "Provide a mechanism",      what must be done through the UI?  =======================================================    Can the technique to satisfy these checkpoints be through a style  sheet? An initialization file? These are "mechanisms", even  though they do not directly involve the user interface.    The following paragraph from section 3.7 attempts to address  which requirements must be met through the UI and which don't  have to be:       "The user agent must satisfy all requirements involving user     interaction (both user input and output to the user) through     the user interface of the subject of the claim. This includes     not only the requirements that directly refer to to user     control, configuration, etc., but also requirements that     indirectly involve the user interface (e.g., system     conventions pertaining to the user interface)."    I am afraid that this paragraph might not be sufficient. For  instance, it should be possible to satisfy many of the  "configuration" requirements through configuration files (indeed,  checkpoint 11.5 makes a "profile" requirement so I hope that  these requirements can be satisfied through config files!).    --------  Proposal  --------    19a) Add the following statement after the paragraph of section  3.7:         "The user agent may satisfy the configuration requirements       of this document through configuration files (e.g.,       profiles).  The user agent should (also) allow the user to       configure the user agent through the user interface."    19b) Add statements to checkpoints 10.2, 10.4, and       10.7 that since the "mechanisms" themselves        do not require user interaction, they can be implemented       however the developer chooses. But the interaction part       is subject to the paragraph from section 3.7.    =======================================================  20) Checkpoint 12.1: Should be relative priority  =======================================================    Tantek supports the relative priority solution to the priority of  this checkpoint.    =======================================================  21) Checkpoints 12.2, 12.4, 12.5: Definition of features       that benefit accessibility.  =======================================================    We need to harmonize what we intend by "features that benfit  accessibility."    The Note after 12.2 reads (12.5 is similar, 12.4 needs one too):       "For example, review the documentation or help system to     ensure that it includes information about the functions and     capabilities of the user agent that are required by WAI     Accessibility Guidelines, platform-specific accessibility     guidelines, etc."    In checkpoint 8.1 we state:      "The accessibility features of a specification are those    identified as such and those that satisfy all of the    requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"    [WCAG10]."    --------  Proposal  --------    21a) In checkpoint 8.1, change the statement to:      "For the purposes of this document, the accessibility features    of a specification are those identified as such and those that    enable the author to satisfy the requirements of the "Web    Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10], whatever the    priority."      Editorial: Should this read "and those" or "or those"?    21b) Harmonize the language of Guideline 12 Notes as follows:      "For the purposes of this document, features that benefit or    affect accessibility are:       1) The features of specifications (implemented to satisfy the     requirements of this document) that are identified as     accessibility features, and those that enable the author to     satisfy the requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility     Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10], whatever the priority."       2) The features of the user agent that satisfy the     requirements of UAAG 1.0 and the requirements of operating     environment accessibility guidelines."    19c) I'd like to factor 21b into one Note (e.g., 12.2) then  cross-reference it from the other checkpoints in Guideline 12.    =======================================================  22) Checkpoint 12.5: "All changes" is too broad  =======================================================    Tantek argued that a developer may not be able to document some  changes (e.g., because the information is confidential or  proprietary), would probably not want to document all of them  (because they could very well be numerous), and might not be able  to determine readily (especially for low-level bug fixes) which  ones affect accessibility.    --------  Proposal  --------    22a) Change "all changes" to "important changes". This    allows some filtering, and probably requires no more    interpretation than "all changes" (i.e., it is no more vague    thatn 12.5 already is). This doesn't address the    problem of confidential information, but I don't think we    can do much about that. Instead, it allows developers to    satisfy the checkpoint by providing a reasonable list of    important changes.    22b) Make this checkpoint a Priority 3 checkpoint. [This part    of the proposal can be considered separately.] As a result     of issue 373 [7], we chose not to make this checkpoint a P1      checkpoint (since the full documentation is available, so having    the changes available separately is not a P1    requirement). However, I am not convinced that having the list    of changes available merits even priority 2.      [7] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#373    =======================================================  23) Is the glossary informative?  =======================================================    Tantek asked whether the glossary was informative. I don't think  it is. While some terms are clearly informative (e.g., "assistive  technology), others are clearly not just informative  (e.g,. "recognize", "content", "animation"). In fact, most of the  glossary entries probably include information that is important  for conformance (and thus cannot be considered non-normative).    The references section is split into normative and informative  references (DOM is normative since it must be implemented for XML  content).    --------  Proposal  --------    Add the following Note to the beginning of the glossary:      "This is a normative glossary, although some of the terms (or    parts of explanations of terms) do not affect conformance."    I don't think it's worth trying to identify the normative and  non-normative parts of the glossary. Or rather, it might be worth  it, but I don't want to do it right now.    =======================================================  24) Does "document source" include HTTP headers? What      is the relationship between content negotiation and      conditional content?  =======================================================    The definition of "document source" starts:      "In this document, the term "document source" refers to the    data that the user agent receives as the direct result of a    request for a Web resource (e.g., as the result of an HTTP/1.1    [RFC2616] "GET", or as the result of viewing a resource on the    local file system)."    According to this definition, HTTP headers are part of the  document source.  But are they part of content?    The answer is no, not according to our document.  We say that the  document object is generally derived from the document source  (and possibly the result of repair, etc.).  The user agent is not  required to transfer all of the document source to content (i.e.,  the document object).    We say that content is the document object. And that conditional  content is content. Therefore, conditional content does not  include Web resources in other formats (content negotiation)  or languages (language negotiation) that the user agent could  access but has not due to the user's configuration.    --------  Proposal  --------    No change to the document.    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I've published the 4 April 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and Techniques  [2]. The changes in this version [3] are on the Web and quoted below  as text.    This version is mostly about changes to the Techniques Document.  I  classified the techniques for each checkpoint. I think the following  checkpoints need particular attention: 2.7, 2.9, 3.4, 3.8, 4.13-4.15,  5.2, 5.6, 6.1, 6.2, 9.4, 10.3, 11.1, and 11.3. Of course, all of the  techniques should be reviewed and augmented.

      Hello,    After some discussion with Charles, it would seem that people have  different interpretations of checkpoint 5.4. The question seems to  be: Do UA developers have to provide access to ATs even when there  are no standard (system) APIs for doing so?    1) For access to content, the answer is you have to implement the     DOM, so there is no issue.    2) For access to UI controls, checkpoint 5.4 says:        Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent       user interface controls using standard APIs ...."        Does this mean:           - You must provide access using standard APIs.      - You must provide access, and you must use standard APIs         (when they exist) to do so?    If the interpretation is the latter, then I think Wendy's question  is answered: UA developers must always use some API. (Talking with  AT developers to create a good one is, in my opinion, out of scope  for this document though a good thing to do.)

      Hello,    Please consider for discussion the following proposed  minimal requirements for these checkpoints (from the 10   June 2000 draft [1]):      1) Checkpoint 6.1  Implement the accessibility features of supported                   specifications (markup languages, style sheet                  languages, metadata languages, graphics formats, etc.).        Note: In UAAG 1.0, this is not a relative priority checkpoint.           Therefore, it is P1 to implement all accessibility features.        Proposed Minimum:  If the specification or another document        indicates what features benefit accessibility, be sure to implement       those. Implement those features that satisfy the requirements of        the three WAI guidelines. [Note that this is almost circular since       checkpoint 6.1 is a requirement of UAAG 1.0. This means: if the       spec refers to something that is addressed as an accessibility  feature       of a UA, implement it.]    2) Checkpoint 8.1  Make available to the user the author-specified  purpose      of each table and the relationships among     the table cells and headers.        Proposed Minimum: For graphical user agents, it is sufficient        to render a table as a two-dimensional grid with header  information,       and to make available all content per checkpoint 2.1.     3) Checkpoint 2.7  For author-identified but unsupported natural  languages,       allow the user to request notification of language changes in  content.        Proposed minimum: Indicate the language change in content.     4) Checkpoint 8.2  Indicate to the user whether a link has been visited.        Proposed minimum: Graphically, at least one        option that is not based on color. The user must also have         this information available programmatically. For CSS user        agents, implement CSS pseudo-elements, which allows user styling.     5) Checkpoint 8.3  Indicate to the user whether a link has been      marked up to indicate that following it will involve a     fee.         Proposed minimum: Graphically, at least one option that is not         based on color.      -Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000610/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Issue 294 [1] (raised by Tantek ?elik, cc'd here) is about the scope   of "native support" and its relation to dynamic updates to software.  Does the definition of native support allow the user agent   to download modules (that will promote accessibility) from the Web?   Here is the relevant excerpt from the 28 July Guidelines [2]   definition of native support:    <BLOCKQUOTE>     A user agent supports a feature natively if it     does not require another piece of software (e.g.,     plug-in or external program) for support.      Operating system features adopted by the     user agent to meet the requirements of this     document are considered part of native support. ...  </BLOCKQUOTE>    As is, the definition seems to clearly indicate that downloadable  modules could not be considered native. Here are some notes  on the topic for our discussion this week:    1) Does native support require that a feature be part of      the user agent by default? If a user agent feature that     promotes accessibility is available on the install CD     but is not installed by default, does that mean that     it is not supported natively? If "by default" is considered     part of native support, the document needs to say so.    2) (This point is important for those who think that native     support does not imply "available by default"): What's the     difference between installing from the Web and installing     from a CD?    3) Jon Gunderson and others have pointed out that users cannot     always install new software or features or modules (e.g., when     they work in a public environment such as a library). This     argument is not limited to accessibility issues: a user agent     may be unusable for any number of reasons related to lack of      resources. It's the responsibility of the systems team in this     particular case to ensure that the software is usable. Does this     mean that it's inacceptable to say "get these modules from the     Web" just because some users don't have access privileges to     install those modules? I don't think that that's an accessibility     issue.    4) If the UA includes a documented feature that allows users      to get and install modules that provide accessibility features     at the "click of a button", would that count as native support?     What if this is used as a way to get accessibility features into     deployed browsers (rather than having to wait for a new release)?    5) If downloading modules is considered acceptable in some     circumstances, the UA must already be accessible enough     to allow users to  download those modules.     - Ian      [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#294  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000728  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hmm, I was hoping that "all text" suggested "all text all the time"    I propose using the term "global", which is already used in  the checkpoint on global volume control.     > Another nit: "domain" of system colors, from which a choice is made.  > My training suggests that "domain" applies to the definition of available  > values for a function, and that "range" applies to result.  > In color-space, "gamut" may be the word you seek.    I think that "full range" is a common English expression. From  Mirriam-Webster:    range:     8 a : the set of values a function may take on      b : the class of admissible values of a variable    On the other hand, "full domain" shocks me,   though I am aware of the mathematical usage.    I'm afraid that "gamut" may be too erudite.  MW says for gamut:     2 : an entire range or series <ran the gamut        from praise to contempt>     - Ian     > To avoid the issue:  > Note: Allow the user to select defaults from among the available system  > colors, preferably chosen from among the "safe 216" choices that are  > generally available: (0 3 6 9 B E) for each of three Red-Green-Blue primaries.  >   > >>  "Checkpoints for visually rendered text (content accessibility)"  >   > Good.  >   > >>--  > >>Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  > >  > >Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP  >   > Regards/Harvey Bingham    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I've published the 10 June 2000 version of the UA Guidelines [1]  and Techniques [2]. The full list of changes [3] is online  and quoted below. I believe that this draft includes all of the  resolutions of the Working Group since the previous draft of  7 May 2000.    I think the document is shaping up very well, and although we're  not done yet (see todo list below), we are making very good  progress thanks to this very diligent Working Group!    Eric had suggested [4] that certain changes be in this draft,  and I accommodated 3 of his 5 suggestions (the ones related to  control/configuration and synchronization). For the other  two about usage of terms relating to presentations, Eric and   Charles and I had a lengthy conversation today out of which  came two proposed changes to the document:      - One to delete 3.2 and expand 4.0 [5]. This one does not      appear in the draft.      - One to clarify 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 [6]. This one, which       I believe to be editorial, does appear in the draft, and      is subject to review there by the Working Group.    I will take into account Eric's proposed definitions   concerning multimedia terms [8], his request to ensure  consistent usage, and our discussion today in the next  draft, which I hope to publish as early as next week.    I also updated "Determining Conformance to the User Agent   Guidelines 1.0" [7] with some more information about  minimal requirements. Not all proposals sent by the  Working Group have been included yet, however.    For the curious, here's a list of things that   still need to be done (presumably before going to  last call if that is our next step):    1) Once we have resolved all the issues, we need      reviewers to sign off on the WG's resolutions. I will     be sending email to the reviewers to ask them whether they     think we've addressed their concerns.    2) We need to integrate the minimal conformance information     into the checkpoints. I'm still not sure of the best     way to do this, since adding information after each checkpoint     may lead to an unsightly document (in some cases,      the requirements are obvious). The WG already discussed this and       preferred the after-each-checkpoint     approach, but I'm still thinking there's a better solution.        The WG also needs to clarify the normative or informative      nature of each note after each checkpoint. Is all of that      information just commentary, or is some of it key to      satisfying the checkpoint?       Finally, in "How this document is organized", once we have     established conformance criteria for all the checkpoints, we     can delete the sentence that reads "Each checkpoint is      intended to be specific enough so that someone reviewing      a user agent may verify that the checkpoint has been satisfied."     Instead, we can say that the document states what is expected     for each checkpoint. In a future draft of the techniques     document, we can clarify what information is purely descriptive,     what information concerns minimal conformance, what information     is reference material, etc.    3)  A few proposed techniques not yet integrated. EH has      also asked for better descriptions of visuals in the      techniques document. Here, WG contributions would be      extremely welcome!!    4) We should begin re-reviewing the implementation report     in light of changes to the document. That report needs to      be updated after last call.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000610  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000610  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0425.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0434.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0435.html  [7] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs  [8] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0374.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    -----------  CHANGES SINCE THE 7 MAY DRAFT:      Changes to the Guidelines        General         * PDF version is now gzipped (reduced from 10 Megabytes to 600K).       * Style sheet fixed (was breaking under NN).       * Changed "application" to "software" in some places, notably in         definition of "user agent".

"At the completion of user input" means whenever the user  has decided they they're done. What they do before confirmation  is up to them and the user agent's general capabilities  for editing one's input.

I think you are correct.

      Hello,    When we discussed issue 435 [1], a question arose about the normative  status of the "checkpoint group labels". There are four such labels in  our document:     - Checkpoints for content accessibility   - Checkpoints for user interface accessibility   - Checkpoints for communication with other software   - Checkpoints for accessible documentation    These labels were initially included in the document for  organizational purposes only, to address issue 121 [2]. However, they  have since become "normative." The following statement in section 3.4  of the 26 Jan 2001 Guidelines [3] ties the labels to conformance:       "Each checkpoint requirement must be satisfied by making     information or functionalities available through the user interface     of the subject of the claim unless the checkpoint explicitly states     that the requirement must be met by making information available     through an application programming interface (API). These API     checkpoints are labeled "checkpoints for communication with other     software."    The problem is that it's no so clear cut. Some checkpoints include  some requirements that aren't labeled "for communication with other  software" but don't involve the user interface at all (e.g., the  documentation requirements of Guideline 10).    One might think that ideally, each checkpoint should be sufficient to  stand on its own, so this type of general statement would not be  necessary. But some checkpoints depend on the requirements made by  other checkpoints in order to be complete. For example, every time we  say "allow configuration", we don't say "allow configuration through  an accessible user interface that may be operated through the  keyboard" because checkpoint 1.1 ensures that the UI must be operable  through the keyboard.    I think we need to replace the paragraph in question with one that:     a) Makes clear that the groupings aren't normative at all   b) Makes clear that requirements related to user interaction must      be satisfied through the user interface. This may be      "self-evident", but I don't think it hurts to remind people,      notably for some cases where they may not have thought of it.    Proposed replacement paragraph:    <NEW>    "The user agent must satisfy all requirements involving user    interaction (both user input and output to the user) through the    user interface.  This includes requirements that directly refer to    to user control, configuration, etc. but also requirements that    indirectly involve the user interface (e.g., system conventions    pertaining to the user interface). The following checkpoint grouping    labels are not normative and are for organizational purposes only:        - Checkpoints for content accessibility      - Checkpoints for user interface accessibility      - Checkpoints for communication with other software      - Checkpoints for accessible documentation"  </NEW>     - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#435  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#121  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010126/#claim-validation    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The W3C Process Document does not explain to that level of  detail how W3C works. It does say in the 9 June draft [4]  (and earlier versions):           W3C will make every effort to make archival documents         indefinitely available at their original address in         their original form.    W3C *never* (to the best of our ability) changes content  of a published technical report. Therefore, it's impossible  to incorporate errata; you have to publish a new document  (which we've done, e.g., for HTML 4 on two occasions).    There is an issue that has not been dealt with at W3C  as  a whole: what is the normative status of errata pages?  In particular, the AC does not review errata decisions  as they review the original document, so can the WG  just say "this is the fix to that problem" or should  significant fixes be reviewed by the AC?    This topic should be discussed on the chairs list, in  my opinion.    Also, there is a bit on managing errata in the  Guidebook [5], but it's not "normative"; just suggested  practice.      - Ian    [4] http://www.w3.org/2000/06/Process-20000609/tr.html  [5] http://www.w3.org/Guide/Reports#errata     > [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/  > [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA  > [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#Recs  >   > Regards,  > Phill Jenkins,  1.512.838.4517  > IBM Accessibility Center - Special Needs Systems  > http://www.ibm.com/able    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I disagree: if you can't navigate to the active elements, how do you  activate them? That makes it P1.    I believe we used the Priority scheme in a manner largely consistent  with WCAG and that it worked quite well. Sometimes it's possible  to assign a priority on a "logical" basis (i.e., it's clear that  if you don't do this, access will be impossible). At other times,  there is more judgment involve (e.g., checkpoint 10.1 is a P1  for Level Double-A conformance of documentation to WCAG 1.0 because  the WG felt that two levels were necessary and didn't choose  a relative priority scheme. Or, checkpoint 6.1 is a P1 for *all*  accessibility since otherwise they may never be implemented --  the UAWG decided to "take the lead" here).     - Ian    > This is a thorny issue, as it is not clear that the priorities and conformance  > scheme in WCAG 1.0 is the best possible approach in this area.

      Hello,    I propose that minimal requirements for the following checkpoints  from the 10 June draft [1] be established on the basis of   property values in the CSS2 Recommendation [2]:      4.8 Allow the user to configure and control the audio volume.     4.9 Allow the user to configure and control synthesized speech         playback rate.    4.11 Allow the user to configure synthesized speech pitch, gender,          and other articulation characteristics.    The relevant CSS2 properties are 'volume' (in CSS, for speech  only, but we can generalize its values here) and the voice  characteristics properties of section 19.8 [3]:     This is not a requirement for user agents to implement CSS,   but to allow the same range of abstract values as specified in CSS.  CSS also allows numbers and percentages, but I don't want to  make those requirements.    For instance, for volume, the following range would be mapped to   six "real" levels by the user agent: silent, x-soft, soft,  medium, loud, x-loud. Similarly, for speech-rate: x-slow,  slow, medium, fast, x-fast. The relative rates "faster" and  "slower" are relative values specific to CSS inheritance,  so would not be required.    I will write out the specific values for checkpoints 4.8, 4.9,  and 4.11, but for now I want to get feedback as to whether  people think that this is a reasonable approach.     IMPORTANT: I propose that we delete "and other articulation  characteristics" from checkpoint 4.11 since that makes it  much harder to specify minimal requirements.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000610/  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512  [3]  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/aural.html#voice-char-props  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

With the expectation that the UAGL will at some point become  a Recommendation, I would like to start compiling some frequently  asked questions and welcome input from the Working Group. I haven't  put much thought into it yet, but having reviewed a number of  last call review comments, here are some candidate questions:      1. Can my screen reader conform? (yes, but the spec not designed for  this)    2. Can my UA in conjunction with another AT conform? (conformance       must be native)    3. Can I satisfy a checkpoint by using features supplied by the        operating system? (yes, using system conventions a good idea)    4. What does "applicable checkpoint" mean? (summarize definition)    5. Are these Guidelines legal requirements (no, refer to       similar question 11 in [2]. Potentially discuss       relationship to 508, ADA, Telecom Act.)    Note that if a question is asked all the time, there's a problem  with the document and the point should be clarified there first.  Not all questions are within the scope of the document, but  readers must be able to find answers to questions that are  in scope in the document.    Your suggestions welcome,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-RECPressRelease.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

What particular accessibility issues do they raise?  What distinguishes those subjects from Architecture or Philosophy  or Art History?    I could see adding a checkpoint to the guidelines that reads  something like:     "Where it's possible to mark up content (for example    mathematical equations) instead of using images,     use a markup language."    Then, in the techniques document, one could talk about  using MathML to mark up math content.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

      Hello,    The UAAG 1.0 includes requirements to slow video, audio, and  animations (checkpoint 4.5 of 18 August Guidelines [1]). For  an implementation report, and in support of our decision to  choose the detailed minimal requirements that we did, I would  like to document any software currently supporting this feature.    Thank you,     _ Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    During my recent visits to Microsoft and RealNetworks, a couple  of issues arose while reviewing the 9 April 2001 draft [1].   Please see my comments below.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-UAAG10-20010409/    ---------------------------------------------  Issue 1: What should be done with lost packets?  [Proposal]  ---------------------------------------------    Several checkpoints (at least 2.4, 3.5, and 4.4) involve  requirements that, in certain scenarios, may result in "lost  packets", i.e., information that may not be viewed when it is  available and may not be available in the same manner at a later  time.     For instance, imagine a real-time presentation of a baseball  game. The presentation includes some enabled elements (e.g.,  links) that are only available for 30 seconds each.  If the user  pauses the presentation (per checkpoint 2.4), what should the  user agent do with the lost packets? I don't believe that we  intended 2.4 to require the user agent to buffer information  (potentially infinitely) while the presentation is paused.    Proposal:    Clarify in checkpoints 2.4, 3.5, and 4.4 that for some  presentations, the required functionality may result in  information loss. It may be possible to determine from the format  that a presentation is "live". In this case, I think we should  suggest in the techniques document that the user agent should  alert the user (notably in the configuration to pause  automatically) that pausing may lead to information loss. We can  also recommend some buffering.    ----------------------------------------------  Issue 2: Will checkpoint 2.4 be useful in heavily  interactive presentations?  [No proposal]  ---------------------------------------------    In many situations, dynamic content may be accompanied by banner  advertisements, for instance. Imagine a presentation where the  top of the presentation is occupied by a series of eighty banner  ads, one after the other, each lasting 30 seconds.  It would seem  that pausing the presentation every thirty seconds to allow for  user input (for ads or some other content) would not make for a  very positive user experience. In short, dynamic content with  frequent and numerous opportunities for interaction would not  be very usable if paused so frequently. Consider also a stock  ticker, where each symbol is a link to that company's home page  (or data about that company). How would 2.4 work in this case?    I don't have any alternatives to suggest. I am satisfied to leave  2.4 as is, and to be aware that for some content, the pause  functionality may not produce very useful results.    I do note that checkpoint 2.4 is a global configuration  requirement. It might be very useful if the user agent were to  allow the user to not pause selected elements (that might be  selected interactively). That way, the user could say "for this  presentation, ignore this stock ticker and this other set of  banner ads, but pause for everything else that requires input in  a finite time interval." I do not want to add element-level  control as a requirement in UAAG 1.0.    ----------------------------------------------  Issue 3: What is the scope of 2.4? What must be paused?  [No proposal]  ---------------------------------------------    Imagine some content where two interactive streams are playing at  the same time, but they are not explicitly synchronized with each  other (the synchronization case is covered by 2.6). When the user  agent pauses (per 2.4) to allow for user input related to the  first stream, what should happen to the second stream?  Should it  be paused as well, or should it continue?  When would the user  agent recognize that two streams are synchronized or not (e.g.,  in SMIL would the <par> element suffice to indicate  synchronization?)    ----------------------------------------------------------  Issue 4: Conformance for some formats only must be clarified  [Proposal]  ----------------------------------------------------------    It is my understanding that our document allows conformance for a  subset of all formats implemented by the user agent. For  instance, the claimant might choose to claim conformance for HTML  and PNG, but not for JPEG, even if it implements JPEG. Imagine a  media player that implements 20 formats. A developer may not wish  to claim conformance for all 20, and shouldn't be required to.    Checkpoint 2.1 reads:       "For all format specifications that the user agent implements,     make content available through the rendering processes     described by those specifications."    I think that "for all" needs to be restricted to "for all that  are part of the conformance claim". I think the same change needs  to be made for checkpoint 2.2 ("For all text formats..."),  8.1 ("of all implemented specifications"), and 8.2.    I'm not sure how to rewrite them (as I don't want to mention  conformance in the checkpoints if I can avoid it). Something like  this might be reasonable:    <NEW 2.1>   For the format specifications implemented to satisfy the  requirements of this document, make content available through  the rendering processes described by those specifications."  </NEW 2.1>     ------------------    <OLD 2.2>   For all text formats that the user agent implements, provide  a view of the text source.  </OLD 2.2>     <NEW 2.2>   For text formats implemented to satisfy the requirements  of this document, provide a view of the text source.  </NEW 2.2>     ------------------    <OLD 8.1>   Implement the accessibility features of all implemented  specifications (etc.).  </OLD 8.1>     <NEW 8.1>   Implement the accessibility features of all specifications  implemented to satisfy the requirements of this document (etc.)  </NEW 8.1>     ------------------    <OLD 8.2>   8.2 Use and conform to ...  </OLD 8.2>     <NEW 8.2>   8.2 To satisfy the requirements of this document,       use and conform to ...  </NEW 8.2>     ----------------------------------------------------------  Issue 5: Checkpoint 3.3 (blinking/animation) and streams  [No proposal]  ----------------------------------------------------------    What is the relationship between streaming and animated text?  Animated text may be part of a text stream (so the text content  is not all available at time "t"). How should the animated text  be rendered as motionless text (per 3.3) in that case?    I don't think that the user agent should have to wait for the  entire text stream to render part of it as motionless text.    I can imagine the "subtitles" technique, where a phrase of text  is rendered for a few seconds, then another phrase, etc.  (I  don't think that this should be considered an animation, since  this is not a "visual movement effect" as mentioned in the  glossary.) Furthermore, in this case, I don't think there's  interaction between checkpoint 3.3 (animated text) and 2.6  (respect synchronization cues).    ----------------------------------------------------------  Issue 6: Checkpoint 4.6: Captions positioning  [Proposal]  ----------------------------------------------------------    What happens when the author has laid out captions with some  particular constraints (e.g., take up fifty percent of the  parent's available horizontal width and be centered within that  width)? Should the user be able to override that? What happens to  the rest of the layout?    Checkpoint 4.6 reads: "For graphical viewports, allow the user to  position text transcripts, collated text transcripts, and  captions in the viewport." However, I can imagine techniques  (that might even address the previous question) where a solution  would be to render the captions in a separate viewport (i.e., not  in the same viewport, which is suggested by the end of 4.6). Did  we mean to exclude the technique of rendering in a separate (and  positionable) viewport?     Proposed:    <NEW 4.6>    "For graphical viewports, allow the user to position text    transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions in the    same or another viewport."    </NEW 4.6>    For example, the user might be able to select captions and  "extract them" from the presentation into a second viewport,  leaving the layout otherwise intact.    ----------------------------------------------------------  Issue 8: Checkpoint 10.9: Scope of position indicator?  [Proposal]  ----------------------------------------------------------    Checkpoint 10.9 reads:     "Indicate the relative position of the viewport in rendered   content (e.g., the proportion of an audio or video clip that has   been played, the proportion of a Web page that has been viewed,   etc.)."    Imagine a presentation with 80 audio clips in a row (this could  be done in SMIL with a <seq> element). Should the position  indicator account for all 80? Or each one, one at a time?  I  wouldn't want the user agent to have to go out to the Web to get  duration information about all 80 clips in advance in order to  build a proportional position indicator. Instead, I think it  would be reasonable to display in that case something like "First  of 80 clips, 20% of first clip".    I think we should state explicitly that do *not* specify how such  cases should be handled, only that the user have some indication  of time elapse.     ---------  Editorial  ---------     - Section 1.2 talks about "mainstream" user agents. The Palm   Pilot is mainstream (lots of people have one), but is not a   target platform. Instead, we should be more precise and talk   about personal computers or desktop personal computers or   something similar.     - It might be useful to mention the term "audio mixer" in   checkpoint 4.10 since that's a likely technique.     - The 11 April version of the document is split into a number of   sections. There should be a next/previous/contents navigation   bar at the bottom of each section.    ---------  Techniques  ---------    Checkpoint 2.4:     - For a presentation that is not "live", present the user with     a list of time-sensitive links (essentially making them     time-independent).    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

Even to fix links or typos.  The good news is that this leads to stability and confidence  in the fact that links to our documents won't break and the  content won't change in the future ; we want to ensure  that people wishing to read or implement a document all get  the same thing.    The bad news is that sometimes links to other sites break,  or they simply become stale as new versions of documents become  available.     So, we won't be fixing this broken link, but we appreciate  your letting us know that it's broken so we can fix it  in the next version. I will forward this information to the  DOM WG.

      Hello,    Based on some comments from Eric, I've attempted to clarify  the definition of active element. The key clarifications are:      1) Content determines what is an active element.      2) The state of the user's interaction with the document may       limit which elements are active (examples are given).      3) Not all user interactions involve active elements (e.g.,       text selection and copying to the clipboard).      4) The role of "active element" is subject to applicability.    The full definition follows.     - Ian    <DEFINITION>  An active element is a piece of content with associated  behaviors, that the user may trigger (or, "activate") either  through the user interface or through an API.    Content always determines what constitutes an active element. For  instance, the HTML 4 [HTML4] specification defines a number of  active elements: links, image maps, form controls, element  instances with a value for the "longdesc" attribute, and element  instances with scripts (event handlers) explicitly associated  with them (e.g., through the various "on" attributes). The role  of an element as an active element is subject to applicability.    The state of the user's interaction with that content may limit  which elements are active. For instance, an element may be  "deactivated" by a script as the result of the user's interaction  with the content. Or, an element may only be active during a  given time period (e.g., during part of a SMIL 1.0 [SMIL]  presentation). Or, the user may be viewing content in "read-only"  mode, which may deactivate some elements.    The user may interact with content without necessarily activating  active elements. For example, selecting an element's text and  copying it to the clipboard is clearly user interaction but does  not make that element an active element. (The element may also be  an active element, but only by virtue of how the author has  encoded it, not by virtue of the selection functionality provided  by the user agent.)    The consequence of triggering an active element depends on the  element. For instance, when a link is activated, the user agent  generally retrieves the linked Web resource. When a form control  is activated, it may change state (e.g., check boxes) or may take  user input (e.g., a text entry field). See also the definition of  event handler.    Most operating environments use the content focus to indicate  which active element will be triggered on user demand.  </DEFINITION>     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Coordination page [0]:  [0] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wc-coordination.html      OPEN ISSUES:    On 9 July, I documented resolutions [1] to the issues cited.  I believe all to be resolved except issue #3.    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0006.html      >Issue #3: Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars     Addressed in [1], but here's more info:    There are two parts to this issue, I believe: recognition of arbitrary  classification of navigation bars and recognition for known HTML markup.    I believe the UA WG has (or should) punt on the former goal. In another  version of the Guidelines, we can talk more about schemas as a good  way to identify document component semantics.    For the latter goal, Charles has proposed MAP as the proper solution  and Wendy responded [1] that the GL Group had already decided not to  recommend this solution. So the issue could be opened again in GL.    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0012.html    COVERAGE OF UNTIL USER AGENT CLAUSES    Reference Document: 16 July Draft of UAGL [2].    [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990716/    1) WCAG 1.5: Until user agents render text   equivalents for client-side image map links, provide  redundant text links for each active region of a client-side image map.    Comment: While we have several checkpoints that might cover this,  including "1.2 Ensure that the user can interact with   all active elements of a document in a device-independent manner."  we don't have a checkpoint specifically for client-side image maps.  I propose we list this as an example after checkpoint  1.2 in the guidelines.    2) WCAG 5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table      makes sense when linearized.     Comment: The WG has decided not to include a checkpoint requiring that  UAs be able to linearize tables (I believe in [3]).    [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-f2f-19981211.html#media    Instead, the following checkpoints should cover this issue:       7.1 Ensure that the user has access to document content,          including alternative representations of content.       7.2 For dependent user agents. Ensure that the user has access to          the content of an element selected by the user       8.3 For dependent user agents. Allow the user to navigate among          table cells of a table (notably left and right within a row          and up and down within a column).    3) WCAG  7.1 Until user agents allow users to control flickering,           avoid causing the screen to flicker.    Comment: The WG decided [3.5] that since flicker was caused by scripts,  that the following checkpoint ensured control:       [3.5]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0192.html       5.8 Allow the user to turn on and off support for scripts and  applets.     4) WCAG 7.2 Until user agents allow users to control blinking,               avoid causing content to blink (i.e., change               presentation at a regular rate, such as turning on  and                             off).    Comment: This is covered by the following checkpoint:       5.6 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or blinking text.     5) WCAG 7.3 Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content,      avoid movement in pages.    Comment: This may either be caused by style sheets or scripts.           Thus, checkpoint 5.8 and the following cover the issue:       5.9 Allow the user to turn on and off support for user style sheets.       6) WCAG  7.4 Until user agents provide the ability to stop the                refresh, do not create periodically auto-refreshing pages.    Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint:       5.14 Allow the user to turn on and off automatic page refresh.    7) WCAG  7.5 Until user agents provide the ability to stop                auto-redirect, do not use markup to redirect pages  automatically.    Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint:       5.13 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified page           forwards that occur after a time delay and without user           intervention.     8) 10.1 Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows,      do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change      the current window without informing the user.      Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint:       5.11 Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned windows.      9) WCAG 10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between           labels and form controls, for all form controls with          implicitly associated labels, ensure that the label is          properly positioned.    Comment: Covered by the following checkpoint:       9.24 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly           associated with a form control.       Note: Preserved in orientation proposal [4]       [4]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0084.html    10) WCAG 10.3 Until user agents (including assistive technologies)       render side-by-side text correctly, provide a linear text      alternative (on the current page or some other) for all tables       that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns.    Comment: Although this is more about user agents getting it right  rather than ensuring some functionality, this is covered by 7.2.    11) WCAG 10.4 Until user agents handle empty controls correctly,       include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes      and text areas.     Comment: I don't think we have anything to do here. This was to      account for incorrect legacy UA behavior.    12) WCAG 10.5 Until user agents (including assistive       technologies) render adjacent links distinctly, include non-link,      printable characters (surrounded by spaces) between adjacent links.     Comment: I believe this is covered by 7.2 and possibly the 9.5 proposed           in [4].    13) WCAG 13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information       to pages and sites.    Comment: This is only covered if you consider that support for  W3C Recommendations (checkpoint 11.2) will ensure implementation  of metadata (HTML metadata, RDF). I would consider this an  open issue: how to handle metadata.    14) 13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents),      and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group.     Comment: I don't believe we have a checkpoint for this. We could  add one to Guideline 8 on Navigation.

I am a little nervous about exploring natural  language   solutions to descriptions of structure. I personally would find it   difficult to hear the English-language linearization of anything more  than a simple form. I think I would find more useful a structured  navigation mechanism with the ability to query an element for title  information or other metadata.     Please elaborate on whether "the number of controls in a form" would  meet your needs or whether you want structured information presented.     > 2) i considered prefacing the last asterisked item with the phrase quote If  > the user agent supports a system caret or "show cursor" option unquote, but  > removed it as i think it extraneous...  >   > 3) i'm not quite sure whether the last asterisked item belongs in the  > Techniques for this checkpoint, or would be more appropriately added to the  > Accessibility Issues Section entitled "4.11 Forms"    IJ: I don't this technique belongs in the section on loading. It sounds  like a navigation technique that could be generalized to something like:  "Alert the user when navigation has led to the beginning or end of a  structure  (e.g., end of a list, end of a form, table row or column end, etc.)"     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

For Java, try [1], [2], [3]. I looked at the Macromedia site but  didn't find information about accessibility there.    For the need you are expressing: Quick access to key accessibility  features that need to be used or implemented, we are producing  Notes for W3C Technologies.

Action IJ: Talk to Judy about UA ftf.      IJ: She's on vacation, so continue this.    Discussion        1.Issue 294: Native support and downloadable modules        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#294        Refer to JG proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0244.html      Refer to EH comments:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0254.html        JG: I spoke to Al Gilman, Denis Anson, Len Kasday about this      issue. My proposal is a result of that. People agreed that as long      as modules required to conform were documented, that would       be sufficient. Still need to encourage developers to provide      accessible browsers by default.        IJ: Model is (a) anyone can claim conformance                    (b) encourage accessibility by default.            GR: I'm concerned that that's not sufficient. Importance      of accessible installation. I think that developers need to      provide facilities to install components. You need to ensure      that the way of getting and installing software is accessible.        EH: Chicken and egg problem.         IJ: I think that assertions about conformance are different      from operational aspects (installation, privileges, etc.).        EH: When you combine things into a compound UA (screen reader,      general purpose UA, etc.), then it follows that the requirements      of UAAG 1.0 apply.        IJ: The compound entity conforms as a whole, not independently.        EH: All the requirements apply to all the parts about which      the claims are made.        GR: I think that the means of getting software have to be       accessible as well as the software (and it's documentation).      If Vendor A relies on Vendor B, then it's incumbent on Vendor      A to ensure that Vendor B's stuff is accessible.        IJ: No, no dependencies like that! These are just claims.        /* GR still doesn't have access to the Internet */        IJ: Why this model promotes accessibility:        a) Allows developers to improve accessibility of deployed           browsers.        b) Allows AT developers to make claims.        JG: What are the parameters that make something obtainable         in an accessible manner?        GR: It needs to be accessible over the Web according to WCAG         requirements.         JG: So I hear that at least one form of the software must      be available in a WCAG-accessible form.        IJ: Current text in document:           "In order for people to use the user agent at all,          the installation procedure (and any subsequent software          update procedures) must be accessible according to the          guidelines of this document. For example, the user agent          must provide device-independent access and accessible          documentation of the installation."        IJ: Furthermore, "applicability" applies to all of the      components.        EH: Is it permissible to say "product A works with any      product that supports X".         IJ: I think for simplicity, you need to name by brand and      version, rather than generic claims.        IJ: Profiles by name? (e.g., conforms by default).        JG: I don't think that that's useful at this point.        EH: I think that composite user agents are the only way      you'll get conformance for the foreseeable future.         TL: I agree with the summary: from Microsoft's perspective,      we won't guarantee that we'll work with another UA. But we      do encourage, and see in the market, that certain screen readers      will say "we're optimized to work with IE 5.5". It's good      for MS to be able to say "We will work with any AT that works      with such and such and interface."        4.Issue 295: Repair functionalities required / relationship to         conformance to other specs.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#295        IJ: Two questions:        a) Should we delete 2.5, a repair checkpoint? (Priority 2).        b) If we don't delete 2.5, should we mark it as a repair            checkpoint?        TL: If you have UAs generating missing markup, you will result in       lazy authors. This could perpetuate poor markup.        JG: But they won't conform to WCAG, which is what is their      baseline.         EH: I'm concerned about it from a different standpoint: it's      presumptous to have a machine not under the Web content developer's      control trying to guess what the functionality is.        IJ: Refer to "altifier" in techniques.        GR: I think that this is mostly to make the user aware that      an object exists that has not been given an equivalent.        EH: I'm concerned that we call this a "text equivalent" if       it hasn't been provided by the author. Call it something else.      Also, should we indicate explicitly that this thing has not      come from the author? (i.e., that this is an annotation from      an agent that is not the user).        IJ Proposed:       a) Leave 2.5 as a repair checkpoint.       b) Allow configuration to generate or not.       c) If configured to generate, provide information to identify          that the content has been generated.        DP: "c" may be more than what users actually need. It doesn't          matter to me that I know whether the author provided it or not.          IJ: Is it important to accessibility to have "c", or just          usability?        JG: It is important to the user to go back to the author          and say "I need this fixed."          DP: I don't think notification of generation is an accessibility      issue.         /* DP leaves the call, but not in anger <grin> */        GR: Lynx has a universal setting for images:          Render generic placeholder. Or, you can ask for the filename.          I don't care that whether something was generated if I          get a page of filenames.        MQ: I don't need to know that it's generated.            IJ: At least three users have stated that identification of      something having been generated is irrelevant.        Resolved:       a) Leave 2.5 as a repair checkpoint.       b) Allow configuration for generation or not.          DP: I want to turn off generated alt text when I evaluate          pages.        c) Don't call the generated thing a text equivalent.          EH: Just say "supply the URI, element name, etc.)"       d) If object not included by reference, supply element name          as a place-holder.       e) Add a TECHNIQUE:          If configured to generate, provide information to identify          that the content has been generated, not provided by the           author.        TL: Is the generated thing the value of "alt" in HTML, for          example?        IJ: I don't think so, it's not what the author provided.           But how does the AT get it?        JG: The AT may generate whatever it wants based on missing          markup. The AT makes the same conclusion as the conforming          UA.        GR, IJ, TL, JG, DP: Yes.        6.Issue 302: Definition of "recognize" needs review.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#302        IJ: Recognize should probably include something about recognizing      what a script does. A UA should be responsibile for knowing that      a script is calculating a factorial, for example.        IJ: Does anyone want to take a stab at rewriting "recognize"?        IJ: What I mean is "you aren't responsible for worlds you can't      know about."        Recognize is:       a) Know something according to spec.       b) Know something according to volition by the UA           (e.g,. MARQUEE).         IJ: Note that "recognize" is part of 2.5 (and should be part of  2.4).      It's part of applicability to factor it out of checkpoints.        IJ: "Recognize" is really about "the UA has been programmed to      do this." You need to be able to identify text equivalents,      captions, etc.        JG: Important here is the part about the UA's <em>response</em> to      markup.         EH: The value of the term "recognize" is that it's a signal      to the reader. Not every text equivalent is properly identified.        IJ: Subtle point is scripts: you "know" javascript but not the      function of the code.        EH: Some concepts like "recognized by a machine" or       "understandable by humans" are very tricky since there are       varying degrees (is artificial intelligence required? no...).      We expect machines to be able to make some choices, e.g.,      generate missing text, you could even have a UA be able to      recognize a trend in a table. I don't want to rule out someone      doing something smart with complex data. Does all responsibility      lie with the Web Content author? Can we avoid saying in the       Guidelines exactly the limits of "recognize"?        EH: Recognition doesn't require deep inferences when evaluating      a script.        Action IJ: Repropose a definition of "recognize". Include some      information about scripting (distinguish opening window from      calculating a factorial).        3.Issue 293: Is the UA responsible for control of timed  presentations         created by scripts?        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#293          JG: In the past, we've said that the UA is not responsible for       knowing everything about the results of a script.        /* JG leaves the call */        IJ: Looking at current 2.2:              2.2 For a presentation that requires user input within            a specified time interval, allow the user to configure           the user agent to pause the presentation automatically            and await user input before proceeding.         EH: Think of a testing application: you have three minutes to      answer a question, otherwise you must move on.        IJ: The question is, does 2.2 include presentations created      through scripts?        DP: It may be easier to say what is included in this checkpoint      rather than not included.        IJ: So what types of presentations do we mean?        DP: How are they generated?        /* DB leaves the call */        IJ: Note that there's an author responsibility: provide      content you can get out without relying on time. But the UA      could not, I think, in the general case automatically      provide an equivalent for all presentations that involve       time.          EH: Please look at my latest memo on the topic of applicability.      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0254.html        No Resolution.    Open Action Items       1. IJ: Talk to Judy about UA ftf.

      7 July AU Teleconference    Chair: Jutta Treviranus  Scribe: Ian Jacobs    Present:   Charles McCathieNevile   William Loughborough   Dick Brown   Jan Richards   Kynn Bartlett   Gregory Rosmaita   Jim Allan   Wendy Chisholm    Agenda [1]  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-30jun99    Document in review [2]  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990624    SUMMARY OF ACTION ITEMS:       All: Review techniques as assigned.       CMN: Review 25 Feb draft to propose verbiage for the                 following points (related to 2.2.2):               - Use accessible standards.          - If possible, use applicable W3C standards          - Ensure that proprietary extensions to formats used            by the authoring tool do not make content inaccessible.       Ian: Propose clarifying Note to 1.5 that includes                  information about selection, editing e.g.,                  of a block, ease of selection.       Ian: Send proposal for introductory text                  to WG (already sent to CMN).       Gregory: Review tersification of 1.3      Agenda 1) Review of techniques (DEADLINE: ONE WEEK)       William/Gregory: Guideline 1.     Charles: Guideline 2.     Ian:     Guideline 3.     Dick:    Guideline 4.     Jan:     Guideline 5.     Jutta:   Guideline 6.     Kynn:    Guideline 7.    Agenda 2) Wording of 6.2      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0393         DB: Don't like "presentation". Is this style?       CMN: Prefer "nature"        GR: Prefer "nature"       DB: What are we trying to get at? Severity? Type?       JR: Prefer "nature"          Resolved: Ian will repropose if he can come up with something               better, otherwise "nature".    Agenda 3) Priority of 1.1      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0418        CMN: Knowing relative importance is not entirely a minus.          Developers must understand their own guidelines. Will          encourage development of good guidelines.          Checkpoints needs a priority since must be checked.          Should be relative. Intelligent people will have to          make intelligent decisions.         JR: "Use" is sufficiently vague. Should only be "absolute"         Priority 1.       DB: I like wording of CMN's proposal.       Resolved: Adopt CMN's (relative wording) proposal for 1.1.    Agenda 4) Scope of 2.2     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0384        Resolved: Change first sentence of Guideline 2.2 from     "The first step towards producing content is conformance      with standards, which promotes interoperability." to      "Conformance with standards promotes interoperability       and accessibility."       Resolved: Checkpoint 2.2.2: Change "Extensions to W3C Recs"      to "Proprietary extensions to W3C Recs".        IJ: I'm not sure why this is limited to W3C Recommendations, in fact.       CMN: I agree that can be generalized.       JR: Is this in scope.        CMN: Yes. You could extend GIF and create accessibility          features, and this would be in the scope of the WG.       IJ: Proposed:           "Ensure that proprietary extensions to formats used           by the authoring tool do not make content inaccessible."       GR: Perhaps we need to resurrect version from 25 Feb Draft.       CMN: We know that W3C specs don't cover everything.        Action CMN: Review 25 Feb draft to propose verbiage for the                 following points:               - Use accessible standard.          - If possible, use applicable W3C standards          - Ensure that proprietary extensions to formats used            by the authoring tool do not make content inaccessible.    Agenda 5) Wording of 1.4 and 1.5     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0413        IJ: Checkpoint 2.1.3: Propose changing from "Enable navigation           and editing via the structure of the document" to          "Allow the author to navigate and edit the           document based on its structure."       CMN: Proposes clarification:          a) Allow the author to navigate the           document based on its structure.             NOTE: Minimal satisfation of this checkpoint                   means allowing the user to navigate                   element by element. Once the user has                   navigated, the user must be able to                   edit the document.       DB: What does navigate mean exactly here?       CMN: Move insertion point around. Think of "vi", which          distinguishes viewing from editing mode. The two          cursors don't move together (which is odd). In MS Word,          you move scroll bars, which doesn't move insertion          point. You need to be able to do both together.       DB: Are we trying to tell people how to navigate?       CMN: We're requiring a certain functionality. Others can          co-exist, but you must be able to navigate and then          edit. Need to be able to move (and edit) more than          character by character or line by line. Might move          paragraph to paragraph.       DB: Proposes: "Ensure that the editing                 view allows navigation by document structure."         Resolved: Adopt this wording.        IJ: What is the difference between editing the document         and editing the structure of the document?       CMN: Gross level editing. Need more than to be able to          extend the selection more than by character by           character.       IJ: I think the term is "structured editing"       DB: We're talking more about selection than editing. Need         a means for the user to be able to set the selection         easily.                    CMN: I think you need to mention editing since selection         not always bound to editing.       IJ: Proposes: "Ensure that the editing                 view allows structured editing."       IJ: How easy is it to verify this checkpoint? When have         you satisfied the checkpoint (e.g., you can select         tables but not headers)?       DB: And how easy must it be? We want accessible selection         and editing.       CMN:        a) Want to pick up a piece of structure and move/copy/paste            as that structure. (Retains is properties as that object).       b) Second requirement is being able to do this in a useful          way.       GR: "Allow the user to user to edit a structured tree view         (or linearized version) of the document."       DB: By the way, navigation from header to header is not         obvious. Type A to type A navigation not obvious.       CMN: Not required. Element to element sufficies.          HotMeTal, Amaya, Word have outline views you can navigate.          Word lets you move paragraph to paragraph. That would          do the trick.        Action Ian: Propose clarifying Note to 1.5 that includes                  information about selection, editing e.g.,                  of a block, ease of selection.       Action Gregory: Review tersification of 1.3    Agenda 6) Introductions to guidelines     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999AprJun/0385       Action: Send proposal to WG (already sent to CMN).    Agenda 7) Moving forward to last call.       a) Techniques need to be fleshed out before document goes        to last call (Tim Berners-Lee requirement).       CMN: Working on the techniques is really helpful to clarify          the document. For this reason alone, well worth          ensuring that techniques are fleshed out.       Jutta: After techniques review next week, will estimate            last call date.          William: When does Director review?       IJ: No formal program for the Director to read the document.       CMN: But the Director review comes after AC Member Review.          (and before PR as well).    Agenda 8) Accessibility of Amaya.     http://www.w3.org/Amaya/       CMN: We recognize accessibility problems. I'm going to          Grenoble next week to talk to Amaya Team.    Next meeting: 14 July 1999

      Hello,    Please consider the following editorial changes   (reference: the 18 August Guidelines [1])    1) Delete the following sentence from checkpoint 1.1:       "The device-independence required by this checkpoint       applies to the functionalities described by the other       checkpoints in this document (e.g., installation,       documentation, user agent user interface configuration,       etc.)."      Comments:     a) The intent is redundant with the first sentence of        the checkpoint.     b) This could be edited and moved to the note after        the checkpoint: device independence is implicit        in all the other checkpoints since covered in 1.1.    2) Delete the word "device" from checkpoint 1.2:        1.2 Use the standard input and output <DEL>device</DEL>           APIs of the operating system. Do not bypass the standard output          APIs when rendering information.       The resolution to issue 255 [2] for this checkpoint reads:      "Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating system."    3) Change second sentence of checkpoint 1.3 to talk about when      checkpoint doesn't apply rather than when it does:       <OLD>     This checkpoint always applies on systems with a standard      keyboard API.     </OLD>         <NEW>    This checkpoint does not apply when the operating system does not    have a standard keyboard API    </NEW>    4) Clarify statement in section 3.8 on user interface by default:      While the following paragraph is true:       "Each checkpoint requirement must be satisfied by making      information or functionalities available through the user      agent's user interface unless the checkpoint explicitly      states that the requirement must be met by making information     available through an Application Programming Interface (API)."      it would be more precise to add "These checkpoints are labeled    'checkpoints for communication with other software.'"      - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/rfbd-20000411#issue-255  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

We changed HTML 4.01 to make it clearer  that this was the purpose of <map> [1]:         The MAP element specifies a client-side image map          (or other navigation mechanism) that may be associated       with another elements (IMG, OBJECT, or INPUT). An image map        is associated with an element via the element's       usemap attribute. The MAP element may be used without an        associated image for general navigation mechanisms.     - Ian    P.S.

It sounds to me like this line of reasoning places the  entire burden of ensuring support for WCAG-conformant content  on checkpoint 6.2. But there are lots of other checkpoints  (P1 through P3) that are there to support WCAG-conformant authoring.  Checkpoint 6.2 just says: To even get the ball rolling, the UA  has   to implement formats capable of supporting accessible authoring  to begin with.    If we impose Level Double-A conformance to WCAG in checkpoint  6.2, that means that it will be impossible to create a UAAG  conforming browser for formats that only support Level-A  WCAG authoring. Suppose there were a WAI document entitled  "Format Accessibility Guidelines". There would be no  point in this document having a Level A conformance since no  user agent could do only Level A and conform to UAAG 1.0.  Since we don't have a "Format Accessibility Guidelines" today,  we are relying on an indirection, by saying "formats that  allow WCAG conformant authoring." This suggests strongly to  me that if we require WCAG Double-A conformance, then we  render meaningless WCAG's Level A, and I don't recommend that.    > If user agents can only  > render single-A compliant information then the potential of the web is only  > single-A compliant content.     That's not what 6.2 says. 6.2 only talks about the potential  for accessibility. The other checkpoints for *actual content*  address issues of rendering, navigation, control of style, etc.     _ Ian    > The potential of the web should be in my  > opinion triple-A compliant content, so the requirement to allow the  > rendering of at least one double-A compliant content language is a  > compromise between requiring single-A (impossible) and triple-A (easier to  > use).      > I think the potential to access content that is not difficult  > (double-A) for people with disabilities is important and the argument used  > for at least one double-A conformant version of the documentation.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't think that this is necessarily a good idea.    Denis,    I'm not sure which language you're referring to.

This means (and perhaps it needs editorial work if not clear enough)  that the WG will have to choose which checkpoints must be implemented  natively and which may be implemented through an interface. Thus,  conformance depends on some hybrid, which the WG must establish.    Furthermore, conformance for ATs is defined, in exactly the same  way: some combination of natively implemented checkpoints and  communication through an interface.     This conformance proposal implies two (challenging) tasks for the WG:     1) Establish two subsets of checkpoints   2) Decide which ones must be implemented natively.    I hope this addresses your questions.     > One of the themes that has gone through the document in techniques is to  > fully implement and expose the DOM as a means of conformance.

Currently, it reads "should". Making it a "must" would ensure that  other software could implement the other checkpoints that are  not required for conformance. The WG must decide if it wants  to strengthen this requirement.     - Ian        

      Hello,    There are 8 checkpoints in Guideline 3 of the 7 July   UA Guidelines [1]. These are the "turn on/off" checkpoints  that we started to discuss at the 29 June teleconference [2].  We did not finish our discussion of what "turn on/off" meant,  but we resolved that it meant "at least" configuration to  not render its subject on loading of content. It may mean  more than that for some checkpoints, but at least for the  7 July Guideline, the phrase "turn on/off" has been deleted   in favor of more precise wording.    Actually, of the 8 checkpoints of Guideline 3, 3.6 and 3.7  concern changing content and have been studied previously.  This leaves six checkpoints where we should ask the following  questions:    1) Beyond the ability to configure the UA not to render X,     do we need to require the ability to configure the     UA (globally) to render X at some point after loading? Would that     be a P1 requirement? For example, checkpoint 3.3 reads:         Allow the user to configure the user agent to render        animated or blinking text as motionless text.       Do we need to be able to toggle a switch so that text can     again be animated and blinking? I don't think that this would     be a P1 requirement given that motionless text enables     access to text content.    2) Beyond the ability to configure the UA globally to render X,     do we need the ability to control the UA so that individual     pieces of content can be rendered/not rendered?    Here are the checkpoints and some proposals for not  adding additional levels of control, except for checkpoint 3.8.    3.1 Allow the user to configure the user agent to not render      background images.         Proposed: A global configuration to not render background      images on loading suffices. If a background image conveys       important information, WCAG 1.0 requires a text equivalent.      If users cannot read text on the background, they can      configure the UA to not render the background image      and reload.        Note: This does not address the issue of multi-layered      presentations and being able to turn off all layers other      than the topmost layer. I propose that we not add such      a requirement for this version of the Guidelines.    3.2 Allow the user to configure the user agent to not       render video.        Proposed: A global configuration to not render video      on loading suffices since additional control of video       is covered by Guideline 4. Thus, users can load all      video sources, then control each one independently.    3.3 Allow the user to configure the user agent to render      animated or blinking text as motionless text.        Proposed: A global configuration to render animated      or blinking text as motionless text suffices since      lack of motion addresses the accessibility need and      since the resulting still text is accessible.    3.4 Allow the user to configure the user agent to render       animations or blinking images as motionless images.         Proposed: A global configuration to render animated      or blinking images as motionless images suffices since      lack of motion addresses the accessibility need.    3.5 Allow the user to configure the user agent to not execute      scripts and applets.        Proposed:  A global configuration to not execute      scripts and applets suffices since users do not generally      have access to the text of a script in order to determine      on a script-by-script basis whether to execute it. I agree      that some scripts may perform useful tasks at the same      time others do not within the same page, but I don't think      that users will need that level of control (turn scripts      on and off selectively).  Users have access to script text      under checkpoint 2.1    3.8 Allow the user to configure the user agent to not render images.        Proposed: Allow the user to configure the UA to render      no images on loading, but thereafter to select individual      images for rendering. There is not need for a requirement      to allow the user to turn them back off again selectively.      Summary: Except for checkpoint 3.8, I propose that the only  requirement expressed by these checkpoints be to suppress rendering  of content type X on loading. Checkpoint 3.8 should allow  users to turn on images selectively if they were not rendered  on load.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707/#gl-feature-on-off  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0532.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Checkpoint 1.5 of the WCAG 1.0 [1] reads:               1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents                for client-side image map links, provide               redundant text links for each active region of                a client-side image map. [Priority 3]     In the User Agent WG teleconf this week [2], we discussed  how the User Agent Guidelines should respond to this  requirement (refer to issue 73 [3]). The WG felt that  requiring "text equivalents" was overly restrictive as  a solution.    The goal, in fact, is for users to be able to activate links  in a device-independent manner. Rendering image maps  links as text is one way to allow desktop graphical  browsers in conjunction with dependent user agents  to provide access to links. But there may be other  ways, and the UA WG is exploring techniques on this subject.    I therefore propose the following rewording of checkpoint 1.5:       Until user agents allow users to activate client-side     image map links in an input device-independent manner,      provide redundant text links for each      client-side image map link.     - Ian         [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505   [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0233.html  [3] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#73     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

However,  developers  can choose formats for their documentation. We ask them to provide  at least one accessible format.

I guess I should point you to one of the companion guidelines  for Web Content Developers [1]. We don't say "don't use scripts",  but we do say that your pages have to work when scripts are  not supported or turned off.

This is a hot topic at W3C these days and movements to open  up the process further. (Side note: all of the WAI Working  Groups are open and we are always looking for input, such as yours).

I think there's a difference between these two statements:     a) This may be impossible for some people but we don't have      definite criteria for knowing that.     b) This will be impossible for some people and we are certain      of this for the following reasons...    It is possible to define P1 in terms of what is known (with rationale),  and not in terms of what may be impossible for reasons unknown.

I think I agree with that. I also think that people prefer the three-way  grouping (impossible, hard, beneficial) over the two-way groupings  that have been proposed in the past (impossible/possible,  required/optional).    I think it is useful to write down criteria that are used in practice  to determine whether something is impossible, beneficial, or  just difficult. Perhaps it is not necessary to change the rating scale  but simply to:     a) Establish in advance a set of WG guidelines for determining  priority.   b) Document (in the guidelines) the rationale for choosing a particular      priority. I believe that a lot of time is wasted rehashing priority      discussions because the WG has forgotten the rationale for a       decision. Putting the information right in the checkpoint       will help the WG remember and will instruct other readers.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Who has read the 9 March draft?        Yes: None  Partially: IJ, CMN, EH, GR, DP         No: TL    IJ: Has anyone found any show-stoppers?    /* No one has come across any show-stoppers in their partial     review */    **********  IMPORTANT:  **********      All editorial issues with the current document should be sent to the    list before 21 March. At the 22 March teleconference we expect to    vote to return to last call.    1.Issue 466: What are the priority of the accessibility issues and  user agent minimum requirements for checkpoint 9.3    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#466    Question: Is there a real-world example of why it's necessary to turn  off automatic onFocus and onBlur triggering?    AL: I talked to one of the guys at work yesterday. He said the most  common uses: onFocus for selecting, onBlur for validation.    TL: I wrote some DHTML that implements a toolbar. It relies on onBlur  and onFocus to do rollovers (i.e., replace one GIF with another).    AL: Web designers usually do this for the pointing device.    IJ: I've heard rationale for doing things manually, but less for not  doing things automatically.    GR: Recall that navigation sequence changes when you turn off all  script supports.    IJ: If onFocus causes a change to the document such that you can't  activate the other handlers, then this would be a destructive case.    /* GR raises this email message from Al:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0407.html  */    CMN: The form case (don't trigger on enter key) is a separate case, I       think.    IJ: If you do a destructive onFocus manually, you still have to  undo the action. Is there a difference between undo after automatic  behavior and undo after manual behavior?    CMN: There is a difference: Auto behavior can make it hard to   undo (e.g., chaining, refreshing pages).    CMN: There aren't enough people writing accessible pages to give  real-world examples of using focus/blur. If we are successful, then  perhaps we will need this requirement more than today. Perhaps it's  easier to have a general event trap and not exclude specify types of  events.    AL: But I think that today the big issues are mouse overs and form  submissions.    IJ: In the past, we've said that automatic behavior may be  disorienting, thus we've required configuration to suppress automatic  behavior.    Rationale:   * Automatic behavior can be disorienting.    AL: But we can't think of an example where this would happen.    CMN: When people include focus handlers, they have usually done a job  to make those handlers useful. One problem is that part of a page  changes, but the user is not aware of it.    AL: Screen reader gives you a review cursor.    CMN: I use a variety of browsers because a single one does not meet  all of my needs.    IJ: I don't think that there is a guarantee that if you can't prevent  auto-triggering, that access will be impossible. This is unlike form  submission, where you can't finish filling out the form.    CMN: But there are examples where onFocus causes, e.g., a list of  choices to be updated automatically. Every one of the different  players (author, user agent, authoring tool) can help solve the  problem.    GR: Another example: when I was trying to configure a computer online,  a lot of forms used magic links that appear when you do an  onFocus. There is assumption in authoring that you are using a  pointing device: if you navigate to a link that has appeared  dynamically, the rest of the page fails. In other words, the focus  and the pointing device establish context; not the focus alone.    CMN: Part of this is an authoring requirement.     IJ: It seems like:   1. This is not a widespread problem in practice.   2. Not clear to me that automatic triggering is an accesibility      problem that is a P1 problem.    CMN: Think of the structured navigation requirement in conjunction  with 9.3: You navigate around a "static" tree and fire at well.  The  P1 problem is that self-customizing content becomes inaccessible.    /* Denis joins the call */    AL: I'd like to satisfy this requirement so that a screen reader could  do this, by letting the user zap mouse to focus (technique).    CMN: Blind users don't know what they've missed as they're navigating.    Rationale for P1:     * Handlers may cause inaccessible changes to content.    Rationale for P2:     * Not widespread in practice   * People who write onFocus handlers may be aware of accessibility  problems.   * This is a repair functionality if changes cause inaccessible content    IJ: It's hard for me to include a P1 requirement for extreme cases.    DP: How does this affect access to all content? Would you not fail 2.1?    IJ: Who can't live with it as a P2?    Resolved:   * Make checkpoint 9.3 a P2 checkpoint.     IJ: Note that an objection will be strengthened by evidence that this  is widespread in practice.    2. Comments from Denis Anson:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0425    IJ: Any statements the WG needs to review here?    DA:     * In section 1.1: change "support authoring practices" to     "addresses authoring practices."    * Checkpoints 1.1 and 1.3: The way I read these, it's not    clear you always have to do the keyboard.      CMN: I want to see 1.1 say: you have to do the keyboard.         I want to see a new 1.2/1.3 with input modality labels.      IJ: I don't think you need a label if it only appears once.        This is why it's different than content type labels.      EH: Even a set of one, for the sake of consistency, to use a label.        DA: I agree that it sounds contradictory to say "you have do to        this but you don't have to."     CMN: I have two parts to what I'd like to see:    * Split 1.1 into two different checkpoints (you get      a sense of two classes of requirements.)     IJ: The input labels are conformance labels. The content type       labels are next to the checkpoint labels for convenience       only.     IJ: All the checkpoints are accessibility requirements, not       conformance requirements.    Resolved: (this is issue 465)   * Split 1.1 into two checkpoints.   * Add to introduction of Section 2 that content type     labels after checkpoints are for convenience only.   * Include an example of evaluting a browser for     conformance.    CMN: If I'm not satisfied with the wording, I'll send  a new proposal.    Revolved:     * For checkpoint 2.2, move text format requirement from      the note to the checkpoint.   * Make clearer the "additional bonus should" of the Note.    DA: In checkpoint 2.3, why not have notification to AT that something  is there and unrendered?    IJ: The checkpoint says "alerts the user" as well.    /* No change */    DA: 2.4: Does this include the condition where there are embedded  links inside a QuickTime movie, for example, that allow a user to  further explore building shown in the movie?     /* The WG thinks that Denis' example is covered by 2.4 */    DA: I'm not sure what this checkpoint means.     Action IJ:    * Work on editorial changes to 2.9   * Include an example (e.g., "alt" for IMG in HTML).    DA: Checkpoint 3.1: What about condition where you have a table with a  background image?    IJ: That's a chosen limitation of this document.    Action IJ:   * Add to the beginning of the document (limitations)     that 3.1 doesn't cover layers.    DA: What if text is bigger than the space alloted for the      scrolling area?    CMN: You have to come up with some solution. It might be that you  re-render the content. It's the same as when you fire up a page  without images that chop off alt content.    IJ: The unblinking text doesn't have to be in context.    Action IJ:     * Add to the techniques document that it's ok to render     the unblinking text not in context.    DA: Checkpoint 3.5: How do I get content after I said no?    DP: Manual refresh is ok.    IJ: By saying no, you may miss some content. But I don't  think we are asking the UA to save 600 versions of a page.    CMN: There is an essential limitation that we can't stop the external  world.    DA: This is like frame-dropping.    /* No change */    DA: Checkpoint 3.7: [SUBSTANTIVE]. When you do this, there should be  an option that when I render "this image" it dismissive the previous  image. Too many images are two many images, whether they all appear at  once or serially one after the other.    IJ: One way to achieve this is to reload the page with images turned  off. We already discussed this and decided that toggling back off was  not considered a requirement.    /* EH leaves */    DA: I think it is, though. I worked with a guy who could hold 5 cards  in his hand, but couldn't hold 6 (he started playing as though he had  9 cards). You need a way to resimplify the page.    IJ: Why so burdensome to turn all images off?    DA: This is burdensome for someone with a cognitive disability.    IJ: This would apply to 3.2 as well (same reasoning: turning on video  and animated images).    AL: Implementation note: Netscape 6 or any Mozilla lets users turn  toggle images on/off on a per-image basis.    DP: I often browse without images turned on. When I'm working with a  sighted user, they often want to view images individually without  having to turn them on globally.    CMN: I do this in Lynx - run Lynx and view images one at a time.    DA: It would also satisfy the user requirement to show an image  temporarily and when you're done, make it disappear.    Action IJ:     * Add to techniques to show images "temporarily" and when you     leave the image, it goes away.    DA Proposal: Add toggle-off requirement to 3.2/3.7.    Action IJ: Write a proposal for what the new wording might be  for these checkpoints.    No resolution for now.    ------------------  Proposals from Ian:  ------------------    Proposal from IJ to delete 1.2:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0415.html    Resolved:   * Delete 1.2 and   * Make it clear that 1.1 (or sons of 1.1) cover     both content and UI.    -------------------  Action Item Summary  -------------------  -----------------  Completed Action Items  -----------------    3.IJ: Propose text for how other documents should reference UAAG 1.0    Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes    Done in 9 March draft.    4.IJ: Distinguish techniques for fast forward versus faster palying   (digital talking books), and point to digital talking books    Source: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes    9.JG: Write a proposal related to the expected actions as the result of   triggering events associated with the focused element.

Hi Charles,    That's not how it is defined in the 12 Nov 1998 guidelines [1]:       "The point of regard describes where the user is expected      to interact with the rendered information."    Further on:       Which of the three mechanisms - insertion point, selection,      and focus - is used to designate the point of regard depends      on context.     The term "Point of Regard" attempts to capture something that  isn't perfectly well-defined (it's a user-interface issue) but  that might at times be established by a cursor while at other  times by the focus.

I think your version of point of regard is interesting and simple  and I wonder how it would affect the current guidelines/techniques:    |[Technique: 5.2.5] [Priority 1]   |      Keep track of the user's point of regard in each view   |      and put it within the viewport when the user returns to   |      the view.     In 5.2.5, Charles' definition is probably what's intended:  "Please return to the data last in my viewport, be it  a screenfull, a pagefull, or a point in a serial stream."    |[Technique: 5.2.6] [Priority 2]   |      Provide the user with information about how much of the   |      document has been viewed (i.e., the location of the point   |      of regard).     Do we mean "Up to a specific point designated by a cursor, the  focus, or the selection?" Or "Up to a specific point that is  the beginning of the data in my viewport?"    |Guideline 5.6: Allow the user to search for information on the page  |   When a search matches, the point of regard is moved   |   to the matched location.     Does this mean that the viewport moves to expose the matched search  text? Or does it mean that the selection is moved to the matched  search text? Or both?    QUESTION: Should "point of regard" be defined as the beginning of the  content in the viewport? Would that be useful to describe   the desired behavior?    If so, we must more precisely identify when selection and focus  are meant (e.g., which moves after a search matches).     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

It has a couple of new/improved features, and among other things,  it supports longdesc attribute of IMG element.    Trial version is available from IBM's Web site [2], and I just tried it.  It worked!  Maybe it's the first product that supports longdesc, isn't it?    As for content type, "Home Page Reader" accepts both HTML and plain text  for longdesc.    It also claims that it supports summary attribute of TABLE element,  but as far as I tried, it didn't read summary.

Absent:  Mickey Quenzer, Rich Schwerdtfeger  Regrets: Eric Hansen    Reference document 25 May 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010525/    ----------  Discussion  ----------  ----------  #503: 9.5: Clarification requested: does this mean that onfocus events  are not triggered?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#503  ----------    JG: I note that there's bad implementation of "onchange" (since it  should only be triggered once focus leaves an element).    JG: I think that the only HTML events at issue here are onchange,  onfocus, and onblur.    IJ: The checkpoint says "explicitly associated input device event  handlers".    Resolved:     - 1.2 is only about input device event handlers only.    Resolved:     - 9.5     a) This is not about input device events.     b) This checkpoint should say that this is about        any events related to the change of focus (either        set or remove). This may include "onchange",        but probably should not by specification.     c) Change brief description at beginning of checkpoint.    ----------  #504: 7.2, 7.3, 7.7, 12.3: Default values inherited from  operating system.  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#504  ----------    Resolved:     - When default values are inherited through the operating     system settings, the user agent is not required to satisfy     the default settings requirements.    /* On a related issue of whether default values need     to be "accessible" */    DA: This is important in shared environments, where configurations  can't be changed.    DP: If the defaults make it impossible for some users to select  profiles or otherwise configure the user agent, then the defaults  don't help.    Action IJ: Mention "themes" in the section on configuration files  (along with profiles, init files).    ----------  #505: Is single-key mode a sufficient technique to satisfy 11.4         single key requirements?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#505  ----------    Resolved:   - Single key mode would satisfy 11.4: You enter single     key mode, and thereafter you have single key bindings.   - User should be able to enter/leave single key mode     with a single key binding.    TL: This would probably be something done at the OS  level.    ----------  #506: 4.1., 4.2, 4.3: How does one value work when different  components render different content?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#506  ----------    IJ: Single global configurations don't readily cross   plug-in boundaries.    TL: Global settings are supposed to be global. If a plug-in  doesn't pay attention to the global setting, that's an issue  for the plug-in.    IJ: I think that we said "global" as opposed to "element level".  "Global" was not put in there to satisfy an accessibility   requirement. I think that the idea is that:     - 4.1: The user agent must allow the user to configure the size     of all text.   - A single global setting that does this would be sufficient     to satisfy the requirement. The user agent may have to      satisfy this requirement with more than one setting, e.g.,     in the case of support for N different formats, some of      which are rendered by plug-ins.    Action IJ: Send a proposal to address the "global configuration"  issue: it may be several settings.    ----------  #507:   If no global background color, does checkpoint apply if user agent can  do on a regional basis?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#507  ----------    Resolved:     - Checkpoint 4.3 does apply to all regions (same for 4.2, 4.2). The   format may not allow background to be set at a global level, but it   doesn't matter to the user: the background color has to be "color X"   everywhere.    ----------  #508: 4.5: Require clarification - is fast playback required, or just  the ability to jump forward in time?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#508  ----------    Resolved:     - Fast playback is not required.   - Fast playback should be implemented (technique).    -------------  #509: 6.1, 6.2: P1 to provide access to content (e.g., in raw form),  DOM either P2 or alternative  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#509  -------------    IJ: So, is access to the raw content sufficient?    DA: If you just give access to raw content, you offload all of the  burden to the AT, for whom it would be equally difficult to do the  work.     TL: You don't want to do the same thing twice. If the UA  is parsing anyway, you don't want to do things twice.    IJ: The biggest problem I see is incremental updates based  on changes to content in the user agent. This would be  very costly, and the AT would continually lose a handle   on where the user's point of regard is.    /* TL leaves. TL will be gone for next two weeks. */    JG: I think another issue is how assistive technologies  will know what to do with "generic" XML in general; how  they will render the information or interpret it.  [For discussion at the 31 May teleconference.]    DA: At the US federal govt. level, they say in their guidelines that  cost alone is not a sufficient reason not to do something (it's  against US law).    Resolved:     - No change to the document. Raw access to content is     insufficient because of burden it places on ATs.   - Cost has not been a criterion for establishing     user needs.    -------------  #510: Conformance: How to observe OS conventions when building         a cross-platform user agent?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#510  -------------    DA: In general, this is done through a hardware abstraction  layer. There has to be custom code that talks to the hardware.    IJ: Here's an example: what if there's a standard help tool on a  particular platform, but you want to provide your help as HTML?    IJ: In the case of APIs, we said that interoperability was most  important, except if broken.    DA: Users have expectations about behavior. If you put a Windows-like  application on the Mac, you will surprise users (cognitive overload).    DA: Our document is intended for users; the developer's point is  from the developer's perspective.    IJ: Seems to me that 7.3 is really the only debatable checkpoint (as  the others seem really critical).    DA: It is an issue for users when software functions differently from  the other software on your system.    IJ: Here's what section 508 says:      "Applications shall not disrupt or disable activated features of    other products that are identified as accessibility features, where    those features are developed and documented according to industry    standards. Applications also shall not disrupt or disable activated    features of any operating system that are identified as    accessibility features where the application programming interface    for those accessibility features has been documented by the    manufacturer of the operating system and is available to the product    developer."    IJ: This is different. We say "implement them", and they say "don't  disrupt accessibility features."    HB: The 508 people wanted to make their requirements more specific  then ours.    DP: There is some history that points to using the environment to help  users use tools. When a bunch of assistive technologies first came  out, they didn't follow operating system conventions. They have  evolved in that manner, however. E.g., HPR 3.0 requires lower  learning curve than HPR 2.5.    JG: What happens if I implement a user agent in Java?    JG: WG seems to be saying that if you do cross-platform, you need  to provide at least one configuration that aligns with the   conventions of the operating environment.    DA: Like Microsoft Word lets you have a Word Perfect interface.    Resolved:     - No change: conventions are important at a P2 level.    -------------  #511: What is definition of applet?   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#511  -------------    Resolved:     - Accept definitions of applet in plug-in in 25 May draft.    -----------------  Open Action Items  -----------------    3.IJ: Coordinate usability testing of the guidelines (JRG volunteers to   be one of the testers).

      Greetings Working Group,    Congratulations! The UAAG 1.0 has returned to (its second)  last call. Below is a copy of the letter I sent to the   W3C Chairs forum a moment ago announcing the beginning   of the review.    Best regards,     - Ian    On behalf of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group  (UAWG) [1], I am pleased to announce the publication of the "User  Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" (UAAG 1.0) last call Working  Draft. The document is available at:             http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    The last call review period ends 13 November 2000. Please send review  comments before that date to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org (archives [2]).  The  UAWG has scheduled this review period based on comments received as a  result of our request to the Chairs [3, W3C Members only].    The Abstract and Status sections of the document are excerpted   below. I look forward to your review comments,     - Ian Jacobs, W3C     Team Contact for the UAWG    DECISION TO GO TO LAST CALL    At their 12 October 1999 teleconference [4], the User Agent Guidelines  Working Group decided to move the UA Guidelines to last call.  By  moving to last call, the UAWG indicates that it is seeking feedback  from the larger Web community about this document, especially from  other W3C Working Groups. The UAWG intends for this document to  advance to W3C Recommendation status as described in its charter [9].    WORK SINCE PROPOSED RECOMMENDATION    This last call comes almost one year after the previous last call  review for this document. The Director returned the document to  Working Draft status as a result of comments received during the  Proposed Recommendation review period (which ended 7 April 2000).  Since that time, the Working Group has been revising the document  based primarily on comments that it was difficult to gauge conformance  (refer to a snapshot of the Working Group's issues list [5] with  resolutions to all issues raised during Proposed Recommendation  review). The result of this effort is a document whose scope is more  well-defined, whose minimal requirements have been clarified, and that  is easier to use. The UAWG believes that it has addressed all issues  raised during the Proposed Recommendation review, but has not asked  for explicit sign-off from each Proposed Recommendation reviewer since  the document is moving "backward" to last call rather than forward to  Recommendation.    The list of changes to the Guidelines [6] and the UAWG's active issues  list [7] are available on the Web.    MINORITY OBJECTIONS    Three objections have been recorded in advancing this document  to last call:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0109.html    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0110.html    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0111.html    There was also one minority objection from the previous round of  reviews:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0178.html     DEPENDENCIES AND REVIEW    The Working Group thanks all who have contributed to the Guidelines  and Techniques document. The Working Group also thanks in advance  everyone who has committed to reviewing the last call Working Draft.  The list of confirmed reviewers is available [8] on the Web.    The Working Group has identified dependencies with the following W3C  Working Groups. Even if review is not possible, we request that the  Chairs listed below announce their review progress or intentions to  w3c-wai-ua@w3.org.    1) Protocols & Formats Working Group     Co-Chairs: Al Gilman, Daniel Dardailler    2) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group      Co-Chairs: Gregg Vanderheiden, Jason White     3) Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines Working Group     Chair: Jutta Treviranus     4) Education & Outreach Working Group     Chair: Judy Brewer    5) Cascading Style Sheets & Formatting Properties (CSS/FP) Working Group     Chair: Chris Lilley    6) Document Object Model (DOM) Working Group     Chair: Lauren Wood    7) HTML Working Group     Chair: Steven Pemberton    8) Mobile Access Interest Group     Chair: Tatsuya Hagino    9) Synchronized Multimedia (SYMM) Working Group     Chair: Aaron M. Cohen    10) Voice Browser Working Group      Chair: Jim Larson    11) Internationalization Working Group      Chair: Misha Wolf    12) Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Working Group      Chair: Chris Lilley    NOTE: Editors of W3C specifications that include user interface  requirements as part of conformance are encouraged to "apply" the UAAG  1.0 to their specifications as part of their review of UAAG 1.0. This  will help establish whether the user interface requirements of those  specifications are complete and in line with those of the UAAG  1.0. Reviewers are also encouraged to indicate what user interface  requirements are made by W3C specifications that do not appear   in UAAG 1.0.    IMPLEMENTATION REPORTS ENCOURAGED    The UAWG encourages all last call reviewers to document  implementations known to satisfy the checkpoints.  This information  will help the UAWG prepare an implementation report for presentation  to the Director should the document advance to the next stage of the  Recommendation process.    The suggested technique for documenting which user agents (or  combinations of user agents) satisfy the checkpoints is to send email  to w3c-wai-ua (or, if you wish your evaluation to remain confidential  within the team, to wai-ua-review@w3.org) the following information:     - The URI of the document being reviewed (in this case     http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/)     - A checklist [10] completed with the following information for     each checkpoint reviewed:         * the name and version of the software            components that satisfy the checkpoint,         * the name and version of the host operating system,         * when available, documentation that supports your           assertion (preferably on the Web).    The UAWG has evaluated user agents in the past for purposes of  strengthening the document and building an implementation  report. Refer to the list of user agent evaluations [11].    The Working Group has also published a "Techniques Document" that  explains different ways to satisfy the requirements of the Guidelines.  Comments on this document are also welcome, although it is not in Last  Call. The Working Group does not anticipate moving the Techniques  Document to Recommendation, but to make it a W3C Note   when and if the UAAG 1.0 advances to Recommendation. The  Techniques Document published at the same time as the last call  Guidelines is:             http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20001023/    ABSTRACT OF UAAG 1.0     This document provides guidelines for designing user agents that   lower barriers to Web accessibility for people with   disabilities. User agents include HTML browsers and other software   that retrieves and renders Web content.  A user agent that conforms   to these guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user   interface and through other internal facilities, including its   ability to communicate with other technologies (especially assistive   technologies). By following these guidelines, developers will create   more usable software for all Web users.     In addition to helping developers of HTML browsers, media players,   etc., this document will also benefit developers of assistive   technologies because it explains what types of information and   control an assistive technology may expect from a conforming user   agent. Technologies that are outside the scope of this document   (e.g., those for braille rendering) will be essential to ensuring Web   access for some users with disabilities.    STATUS OF UAAG 1.0      This section describes the status of this    document at the time of its publication. Other    documents may supersede this document. The    latest status of this document series is    maintained at the W3C.      This is the 23 October 2000 last call Working    Draft of the "User Agent Accessibility    Guidelines 1.0". This last call review period    ends 13 November 2000. Please send comments    before the review period ends to the public    mailing list w3c-wai-ua@w3.org; public archives    are available.      The previous formally published version of this    document was a W3C Proposed Recommendation, for    which the review period ended 7 April 2000. In    light of Proposed Recommendation review    comments, the W3C Director returned the document    to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines    Working Group (UAWG) for further work. Since    April, the UAWG has been revising the document    to clarify its conformance requirements and make    it easier to use (refer to the list of changes    to the document). At their 12 October 2000    teleconference, the Working Group decided to    advance the revised document to a second last    call.      To help the UAWG build an implementation report    (as part of advancing the document on the W3C    Recommendation Track), reviewers are encouraged    to evaluate software and indicate (e.g., by    filling out a checklist [UAAG10-CHECKLIST])    which checkpoints that software satisfies.      Note: Three checkpoints in this document    (checkpoint 5.1, checkpoint 5.2, and checkpoint    5.7) refer to three W3C DOM Level 2    specifications ([DOM2CORE], [DOM2HTML],    [DOM2STYLE]) that are expected to become W3C    Recommendations before the UAAG 1.0 becomes a    Recommendation.      Publication as a Working Draft does not imply    endorsement by the W3C Membership. This is a    draft document and may be updated, replaced or    obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is    inappropriate to cite W3C Working Drafts as    other than "work in progress."      This document is part of a series of    accessibility documents published by the Web    Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide    Web Consortium (W3C). WAI Accessibility    Guidelines are produced as part of the WAI    Technical Activity. The goals of the User Agent    Accessibility Guidelines Working Group are    described in the charter.      A list of current W3C Recommendations and other    technical documents can be found at the W3C Web    site.

I wouldn't have expected any "less" from you. <wink>. I've  included the email in its entirety after my signature.    I have some comments and questions about some of your  more salient points:    1) Primary content is "content (meaning #1)     that is intended for people without any disability      who are operating under standard conditions." One thing I like     about this definition is that the content's format doesn't      matter. Text can be primary content and a video can be      alternative content.    2) Distinguishing primary from alternative content sheds     light on some (WCAG) requirements on authors. For example,     I agree that there should not be a P1 requirement to     provide a text equivalent for another (non-text)      equivalent.    3) For reference, here's Eric's revised WCAG checkpoint 1.1:      "Ensure that every non-text element that,        under standard conditions, would result in primary        content has a text equivalent [Priority 1]."    Comments and questions:    1) Are the only types of content primary and alternative?     Your definitions suggest that this is the case. What     is the default when there are no stylistic or semantic     indications (in a spec or in metadata) to distinguish     primary from alternative content? I think that in      the absence of style and semantic information, you      have to consider generic XML content either entirely     primary or entirely alternative. Either case is      problematic.     2) I have a problem with this reformulation of 1.1. Content is     primary based (in part) on author's intention. Your      formulation of 1.1 suggests that content could become     primary independently of the author's intention, just     based on the user side conditions. If content that      started primary doesn't end up primary, what is it?     If primary is established from the author's vantage      point, it sounds like it's either primary or it's not,     independent of the user's operating conditions.    3) What about alternatives of alternatives? Suppose I     use nested OBJECT elements in HTML to say "Include     this video, or if not, this image, or if not this     other image, or if not this text." Is the first     image only an alternative? Or is it a primary in     some other context (having two alternatives)?     The author has intended the image to be an     alternative (in some sense) and therefore would     not be required to provide a text equivalent.     There may be shades of primary.      Would that be confusing?    Basically, I would like to try to keep the notion of  primary content but I want it to only make sense from the  author's point of view. Does the model still work if   primary content is always primary content and there's  no WCAG 1.1 requirement for text equivalents  for content that "results in primary content"? In other  words, the author has to provide a text equivalent for  any non-text primary content. Why does that break?  The assumptions about standard conditions and available  technology are good ones, but can they be constrained  to the author's side and the author's determination  of what is primary content?    I don't think that the user agent should be required to   recognize content as being primary, but the user agent  must be able to recognize alternatives; these are peer   alternatives. Why should the user know what is primary  (notably when what is most important to the user may  not be primary to the author)? Does it benefit the  user in any way to know what's primary?     Your proposed checkpoint 2.1b for UAAG requires user  agents to "make avilable all primary content as well  as all W3C-required equivalents". Is there any need  to single out the primary content?     [By the way, Dan Connolly has said that we blew it  by calling two pieces of content "equivalent" if   their relationship is not symmetric. As Eric points out,  the equivalence relationship is often imperfect and   one-directional. Would we be better off using a term like   "text alternative" with the understanding that the  text alternative is supposed to fulfill the same   function?]    I have to think more about all of this. I think  there are some very interesting points in your proposal,  but I'm having trouble with blurring the lines between  author's intent and the user environment.

      Patrick, Aaron, Chris,    I would greatly appreciate your comments on the questions below, to  help the User Agent Guidelines Working Group resolve some outstanding  last call issues. The questions are about user agent control of  animations.     (I am cc'ing Al Gilman and Daniel Dardailler on this email so that   WAI PF can track this discussion if necessary.)    In the 26 Jan 2001 draft of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines  1.0 [1], there are two checkpoints that involve control of animations:     --------      4.4 Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of audio, video and    animations. For a visual track, provide at least one setting between    40% and 60% of the original speed. For a prerecorded audio track    including audio-only presentations, provide at least one setting    between 75% and 80% of the original speed. When the user agent    allows the user to slow the visual track of a synchronized    multimedia presentation to between 100% and 80% of its original    speed, synchronize the visual and audio tracks. Below 80%, the user    agent is not required to render the audio track. The user agent is    not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video and    animations whose recognized role is to create a purely stylistic    effect.  [Priority 1]      4.5 Allow the user to stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and fast    reverse audio, video, and animations that last three or more seconds    at their default playback rate. The user agent is not required to    satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video and animations whose    recognized role is to create a purely stylistic effect. [Priority 1]     --------    The UA Working Group has questions about whether a user agent can  satisfy these requirements for all classes of animation and animation  format.    1) It would seem that for animations that are composed of "frames"     (e.g., animated GIFs, Flash animations), that this type of     control: slow, reverse, advance, etc. is feasible.    2) It would seem that for some other classes of animations     (e.g., animations that may be created with SMIL Animation [2]),     it may not be feasible to satisfy our slow, advance, and     reverse requirements.    Questions:     * Would you agree with these two assertions?      * Can you help us understand (and qualify) why SMIL Animation     animations do not lend themselves to being slowed, reversed, or     fast advanced (and how we might explain that in our requirements,     if necessary)? Chris indicated that SMIL 2.0 animations [3] were      different than SMIL Animation and could be controlled in the     indicated manner. Why is that the case?     * What other classes of animations should we be considering and     have forgotten about?     Notes:     a) We explicitly do not require user agents to provide the indicated      control for animation effects created through scripts. Our      checkpoints 4.4 and 4.5 only address those animation effects       that the user agent can "recognize" through the format.     b) We are not concerned here with control limitations due to      streaming (i.e., you can't fast advance through streamed content).      c) We are not concerned here with alternative content workarounds      from the author.    Thank you for any direction you can provide,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010126/  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil-animation-20000731  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I've published the 26 Jan 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and   Techniques [2] documents. The list of changes [3] is on the  Web and quoted below.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010126/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010126  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html#WD-UAAG10-20010126    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    General    * Global change of "operating system and programming language    environment" to "operating environment". Left some OS-specific    examples, however.  * Based on discussion at [49]25 Jan 2001 teleconf, deleted many    instances of "author-specified" from checkpoints since the    applicability provision is in effect globally. However, left    "author-specified" when necessary to distinguish from what is from    the author and what is from the user agent: keyboard bindings and    styles, navigation order. Deleted some instances of    "author-supplied" but left a few others where they added clarity.    Introduction    * At the beginning of section 2, added wording "Some checkpoints    (e.g., those requiring developers to follow conventions or    implement specifications defined outside this document) are    inherently more subject to interpretation than others."    Checkpoints    * 2.1: Per resolution to [50]issue 394, (resolved at [51]18 Jan    2001), added source-like view to minimal requirement. Added more    rationale to Note.  * 2.2: Per [52]issue 452 (resolved at [53]25 Jan 2001 teleconf),    modified checkpoint wording.  * 3.2: Content type label changed from Animation to Image.  * Old 3.4: Deleted checkpoint for no blinking images for a couple of    reasons: We are not aware of these on the Web, and if there are,    they are probably covered by the requirements to turn of animated    images.  * 3.5: Per [54]issue 453, resolved at [55]22 January 2001 teleconf,    revised checkpoint to use term "executable content".  * 3.6, 3.7: Switched order. Both clearly indicate that driven by    client, not server. Deleted "author-specified" from both    checkpoints.  * 3.6: Raised to P1 per [56]issue 454 ([57]25 Jan 2001 teleconf).  * 5.8: New This checkpoint added per resolution to [58]issue 327    (resolved [59]18 Jan 2001).  * 6.2: Per [60]issue 324 (resolved [61]18 Jan 2001), modified    checkpoint wording.  * 9.6: Since this checkpoint is P3 and checkpoint 9.3 is P2,    checkpoint 9.6 is a "special case" of 9.3 but not an important    special case.    Conformance    * Intro section to section 3 tweaked to be more readable.  * WCAG 1.0 conformance as part of well-formedness only in the case    when the claim is on the Web.  * Editorial changes to well-formedness section per Eric Hansen    suggestion. The result is that labels are part of well-formedness    in the case of a claim of conditional conformance. So "validity"    is reduced to well-formedness plus verified satisfaction of    requirements.  * In definition of content type label for image, animated images are    now included.    Glossary    * Some clarifications to definition of "active element" based on    [62]proposal from Ian. This definition is likely to undergo more    refinement based on [63]comments from Eric.  * Added definition of "character encoding"  * Deleted definitions of presentation, multimedia presentation,    tactile object, tactile-only presentation, tactile track, audio    object (part of audio track now), and visual object (part of    visual track now).  * Per [64]issue 450 (resolved at [65]22 Jan 2001 teleconf), added    "operating environment."    Techniques    * Added mention that W3C validator handles XHTML.  * Checkpoint 2.2: Added techniques proposed by WCAG reviewers.  * Checkpoint 3.5: Mention "ActiveX" in techniques. Added to    techniques that plug-ins not part of content are not part of this    checkpoint  * Checkpoint 3.7: Added technique: "The user agent may provide a    configuration so that when the user navigates "back" through the    user agent history to a page with a client-side redirect, the user    agent does not re-execute the client-side redirect."

From WCAG 1.0:  Checkpoint 14.2: Supplement text with graphic or auditory                   presentations where they will facilitate                   comprehension of the page. [Priority 3]     It sounds to me like you are requesting that this requirement  have a higher priority. According to our priority scheme, if not  having graphics will make the page inaccessible to some users, then  this has to be a priority one checkpoint. I have two comments:    1) Will graphics address this issues? My sense is that we need further     input on this thread and from additional sources demonstrating that     such a requirement will actually improve accessibility.     2) To make such a requirement palatable (and I think it's important that     the document be palatable, even if the level of difficulty for the     author does not figure into the present priority scheme), we need to     define more clearly the cases when graphics are required.  Where do  you     draw the line to decide what concepts require associated images? What     if I, as an author, deem something obvious and therefore not  necessitating     an illustrative image, but someone with a CD still doesn't  understand?     How do I know when I've provided sufficient graphical alternatives?    I realize this is a difficult issue and I'm glad we're having this  discussion.     - Ian    > It should also be stated that the illustrative graphic should be  > viewable on the opening screen so that it can be used as a navigation tool.    >   >   > At 12:02 AM 3/19/2000 -0600, Gregg Vanderheiden wrote:  > >Anne, Jonathan,  > >  > >You must be pretty frustrated by now with this discussion on the GL list.  > >Similarly -others are also frustrated.

      Hello,    Note: At the bottom of this long email there is a proposed   new version of checkpoint 3.9. Given the history of this  checkpoint (outlined below), I believe this change to be  a clarification of the Working Group's intent. The actual  wording of the proposal (and whether there should be  one or two checkpoints in the end) may have to change.    At the 9 May teleconference, we discussed minimal requirements  for checkpoint 3.8 of the 7 May draft [2]:    <OLD>  3.8 For automatic content changes specified by the      author (e.g., redirection and content refresh), allow the       user to slow the rate of change.   </OLD>    Up until the 20 December 1999 draft [3], this checkpoint was  two checkpoints that were more specific. For example, from  the 6 December 1999 draft [4]:    <6 December 1999>  3.9 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified      forwards that occur after a time delay and without      user intervention. [Priority 3]     3.10 Allow the user to turn on and off automatic content       refresh. [Priority 3]   </6 December 1999>    At the 9 December face-to-face meeting in Austin we made  some changes to these checkpoints as part of discussing  issue 145 [5]. The changes were made in response to  a last call review comment from Gregg Vanderheiden [6].       > GV#16 -----------------------------     > 3.10     > Why is blinking and animation a priority 1  but        > auto refreshing (which can have the same effects)      > only a priority 3?    The Austin minutes suggest the following:     1) We stated that content refresh would not be fast      enough to cause "flashing" might trigger seizures.   2) Refreshing content and content changes might      disorient users (either with CD or who are using      assistive technologies). Screen readers need      time to get to the bottom of a page before      content refreshes.   3) It is not enough simply to stop page refresh; the      user agent needs to notify the user that new content      is available. Thus, the requirement to turn on/off      was insufficient.    We decided to merge 3.9 and 3.10 and the approximate  text proposed was: "Allow the user to set a minimal   interval for author-specified forwards or refeshes that occur  without user intervention. (Setting to "0" or a large   number would turn off the change.)"    Jim Allan then got an action item to propose a new checkpoint  to the list, and his proposal [7] was:    <JIMALLAN>  3.9 Allow the user to set a minimum rate for author specified  forwards and/or refreshes that occur after a time delay and  without user information.  </JIMALLAN>    We raised the priority of the checkpoint to P2 as a result  of the 20 January teleconference [8].    I do not have evidence of how Jim's proposed wording was  modified between when he proposed it on 10 December and  when it appeared in the 20 December draft [3] as:    <20 December 1999>  3.9 For automatic content changes specified by the author   (e.g., content refresh and page forwards), allow the   user to slow the rate of change. [Priority 3]   </20 December 1999>    This is the same text as the 7 May 2000 draft. Apparently  I am responsible for the change, which I must have deemed  editorial at the time.    Having explored the history of the checkpoint and in light of  today's teleconference discussion, I'd like to propose  this modification to the checkpoint:     <NEW>  3.9a Allow configuration so that author-specified       "client-side redirects" (i.e., those initiated by      the user agent, not the server) do not change content       automatically. Allow the user to access the new       content on request (e.g., by following a link).  </NEW>    <NEW>  3.9b Allow configuration so that author-specified        content refreshes do not change content automatically.       Allow the user to access the new content on       request (e.g., by activating a button).       Advise the user to refresh content according to the       same schedule as the automatic refresh, and indicate       persistently that the user has not yet refreshed        content.  </NEW>    Notes:     - For the purposes of considering the issues, I prefer to     have these checkpoints separate. I think notification     is more important to 3.9b than 3.9a (but I could be     wrong).     - This rephrasing of the checkpoints is more specific than     it has been. The phrase "do not change content automatically"     hints at the rationale of the checkpoint. I think it may     be worthwhile to be specific in the checkpoint about     what we want, and then explanation of the minimal     requirements (access on request, notification, persistent     indication) becomes a minor issue.      - The definition of "client-side redirects" needs review.      For more discussion on redirects and refreshes,      refer to comments from Al Gilman on 29 February 2000 [9].

      24 July 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference  [Exceptional teleconf]    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Kitch Barnicle   Gregory Rosmaita   David Poehlman   Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets:   Mark Novak   Jim Allan   Eric Hansen   Charles McCathieNevile   Tim Lacy   Dick Brown   Jim Allan    Absent:   Harvey Bingham   Mickey Quenzer    Next meeting: 27 July.    Regrets for August: Jim Allan      Agenda [1]  [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0098.html      0. Issue 288: Min requirements only in checkpoints?      GR: Obviously we have to be careful in our choice of minimal     requirements.       JG: The problem I have with ATAG's ideas of distributing information    is that developers have to look further. UAAG will make it easier    for developers to know what they have to do.      Resolved: Yes, we will (and have adopted since the 7 July    draft) adopt this proposal.      1.Issue 257: Minimum requirement for checkpoint 10.4: Allow the user  to       change the input configuration. [Priority 2]      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0082.html       JG: Single-step allows modifier keys, single-command does not.       Action IJ: Come with up clearer terminology.     (e.g., "Direct" means you don't have to go through space, but you      may use more than one command to get there.) What does single mean     in the voice realm? Single word (what about I18N here??).       Refer to JG's proposal:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0082.html       GR: Same issues we have for accesskey: cascade required?      warning or notification when customized configuration conflicts     with OS bindings? I want to make sure that developers note     the relationship between various input reconfiguration checkpoints.       KB: What is reasoning behind the "3-step to 1-step" mapping?       JG: It helps us avoid an explicit list.       IJ: I think the choice of 3-step to 1-step is arbitrary     but doesn't reduce the scope sufficiently.       JG: At some point, I had proposed deleting 10.4.       KB: I'm nervous about the configuration issue; I'm not sure     that users will know how to use the configurations.       DP: I have some problems with JG's proposal due to number of     actions.       RS: I tend to agree with Kitch. I want to see something     concrete.       GR: I think we should allow any configuration, basically.     Since the user knows best their needs.       GR: With voice input, how do you distinguish 1 command from three     commands?        IJ: Should we talk to voice browser WG?       GR: Perhaps thinking in terms of voice would help us understand     our scope here.       How many people think every function (from a predefined     set) should be available for rebinding:      KB: I like the idea, but I see the potential UI nightmare.      DP: I agree with Kitch.      RS: I agree with Kitch.      GR: I don't think we can delete 10.4 if 10.5 has a limited          set of functionalities associated.       RS: Excessive configurability doesn't imply accessibility.      GR: I think that we should be considering what is configurable     first, not what is currently done today. 10.4 says that input     configuration may need to be changed. I don't see how you can     get around saying the whole range of functions available.       DP: We need to ensure that people can return to the default      easily (this is covered by 10.7).       JG: Does this mean that you want a built-in macro feature?     RS: Refer to what's required by virtue of 1.3 (through the keyboard     API). I think that we are requiring essentially macro operations.     If it takes you 5 steps in the UI, you need to be able to get at     all of them through keyboard sequences.        RS: Maybe we can say that the UA is required to support no more     than three keys in a sequence.        IJ: I think that we need to consider that something is     "single-stroke" when you can enter a particular mode. For      example, you enter "table" mode and you have 20 single-keys  available.     We could say for 10.5 that these functionalities have to be     available in any input mode.       IJ Proposal: Allow reconfiguration of default input configuration.       JG: We said that this checkpoint was not about changing UAs     conflicting with default input settings. We still need to     promote use of standard controls. I don't think you can rebind     how standard windows controls are activated.       RS: Then let's limit reconfiguration to those functionalities     where there's not a standard binding in the operating system.       RS: I think that people who need keyboard access would not want     to alter standard bindings.       Resolved:      - Reconfiguration must not be required for standard system        controls (i.e., where there are system conventions for bindings).        You can have additional controls for doing something (e.g.,  printing).      - GR: Note that there's a problem with accesskey since system        bindings are overridden in some browsers by specified        accesskeys.      - Reconfiguration is only required for those functionalities with        a binding in the default UA input configuration. This applies        to like input methods (e.g., keyboard bindings can be remapped        to other keyboard bindings). The minimal requirement for         remapping is modifier key and single key.       Action IJ: Write a proposal to the list for revised 10.4.       GR: I think that 10.4 and 10.5 should be the same. That we       get rid of the list of important functions and require the UA      to allow single-key access to everything you can do through      the keyboard by default.        Action GR/IJ: Talk about 10.4 and 10.5 offline.

I have been talking to vendors and saying "the conformance  model allows you to conform for certain formats only, so if you  implement  3 video formats, but only meet the requirements for two of them, you  can still conform for those two." Therefore, statements such as  "for all formats that you implement" seem inconsistent with the  desired flexibility in the conformance model.     > >------------------  > >  > ><OLD 8.1>  > >Implement the accessibility features of all implemented  > >specifications (etc.).  > ></OLD 8.1>  > >  > ><NEW 8.1>  > >Implement the accessibility features of all specifications  > >implemented to satisfy the requirements of this document (etc.)  > ></NEW 8.1>  > >  > >------------------  > >  > ><OLD 8.2>  > >8.2 Use and conform to ...  > ></OLD 8.2>  > >  > ><NEW 8.2>  > >8.2 To satisfy the requirements of this document,  > >    use and conform to ...  > ></NEW 8.2>  > >  >   > AG:: This is a genuine problem.

IJ: I would distinguish animated text (by which I mean scrolling along  the bottom of the screen) from changing text (e.g., as subtitles in  a movie are replaced by new subtitles after a few seconds, and in  synchrony with the video track).     There is an issue here: define "blinking". Do changing subtitles  count as blinking text? (I hope not.)

It seems like an implementation detail to me whether  the captions track is moved to a global x,y that happens to  be in the same viewport, or whether it is put in a new viewport  that is then moved to the same global x,y. One difference might be  that the new viewport has chrome to it, and that chrome might get  in the way of the video content behind it. But suppose it doesn't  have a lot of chrome? Then it seems to me to provide the same  functionality, but the ability to move the viewport is provided  by the windowing system, not the user agent directly.       > Another viewport is sometimes desirable, but does not satisfy this  > requirement.  >   > What happens to the rest of the layout?

      Hello,    As per our discussion at today's teleconference,  I published the 9 March draft of the UA Guidelines  (with a few stylistic fixes) on the TR page   as the 31 March 1999 draft [1].    The next Working Group draft, which should be on approximately  16 April, will incorporate the many suggestions that we've  received in the last few weeks.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-USERAGENT-19990331    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      6 July 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Harvey Bingham   David Poehlman   Eric Hansen   Dick Brown   Tim Lacy   Gregory Rosmaita   Charles McCathieNevile   Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets:   Mark Novak    Next meeting: 13 July.      Agenda [1]  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0010.html    Agenda    A. Review Open Action Items (see details below)    B. Announcements    none    C. Discussion        1.Additional or longer telecons        JG: Tuesdays at the same time? Add 30 minutes to regular time?        /* Only DB participates in WCAG actively */        JG: Who could attend extra 30 mins: DP, DB, TL, IJ, JG, HB, EH             Resolved: Extend teleconf extra 30 minutes (for a couple of  calls).        4.Min / Max requirements for speech synthesis rates.         Refer to Gregory's proposal:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0482.html        Ian's proposal         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0003.html          JG: Provide access to the full range of values available from            hardware.          IJ: Proposal to require full access to available range.          EH: Should it be P1 for lower bound of speech rate,             P2 for upper bound of speech rate?          GR: If the speech experts say that not having a lower bound            to the upper limit, then I favor P1.          JG: We discussed a year ago: speech rate is analogous to            allowing someone to change font-size, colors.          IJ: One could pursue the analogy to fonts: should shrinking            text size be P2?          JG: Several issues:           a) Priorities?           b) What should the user should be able to control?           c) What ranges?          About priorities:             JG, DP: I think high-speed speech is a P1 issue.           GR: When speech is your only means of getting at content,               you need lots of control over the rate.           EH: In favor of P1, if you want to be able to scan large               amounts of data quickly, it makes sense to synthesize               at high rates.             Resolved: Leave speech rate checkpoint a P1 requirement.          About ranges:             EH: I have some concerns about referring to what the                speech device supports. That assumes that the speech               output device is not part of the UA. Some UAs include               the speech component. I'm still in favor of saying               something about ranges.           EH: If you are using an external synth and it doesn't               accommodate the range you can handle, applicability               kicks in.           JG: I think that adjustability is required over the range               supported by the engine. So if a user picks a slow               synthesizer, that's not the UA's problem.           EH: If we establish the range for the user agent, that will               take care of everything: applicability will kick in for               devices that are independent.           JG: Be careful, a lot of different technologies could be               employed. Ranges and enumeration are important.               If a syn provides more than we require, then we still               want the full range of values to be available to the               user.            EH: What makes sense to me:                1) 100-600 words / minute is a P1 requirement.                 2) If you want to require speeds above that, that's                   P2.            JG: Control of synthesizer by the user should be P1.               For certain characteristics, we could provide min/max  values.           GR: I think that it's the wrong approach to have min/max               for speech rate. It's like colors. The minimum               requirement should be about fidelity when you change               pitch, applicability of configurations.           GR: I think it's dangerous precedent to set min/max values.           DP: My only problem with not specifying ranges is that we               make it possible for a synthesizer to be selected by               the user agent that will not allow access.                    IJ: Should we push off these requirements to other               resources as we do for fonts/colors.             JG: It's like a video card: the video card is               a requirement - the video card is not a               user agent, nor is the speech engine.             IJ: There's a difference between "should" and "must".             /* Discussion of philosophy of min requirements */             GR: Risk of min requirements appearing in other               guidelines.                   GR: A better tack for speech rate would be:               a) To support ranges offered by the speech engine.               b) You must choose an engine that supports the                  following range ...             IJ: If you establish min/max as P1 requirement, I don't               understand why it's a P1 to provide control outside the               range. I agree that control within the range is a P1               requirement. Having two ends: 100 and 800 is not               sufficient.             GR: In case of increments, let's talk to experts.             IJ: I agree!             DP: We need complete access to the capabilities of                they synthesizer.              RS: The accessibility issue is what is slow enough               and what is fast enough.             EH: I think there's a nervousness here on the part of               some that our range is not wide enough. Then I suggest               that our range go from some really low speed to some               speed known to be what's perceptible to the human ear.                   CMN: That hurts the ability of tools to conform.             GR: The P1 requirement is to be able to use the speech               engine. There are there parts:               a) I want complete access to the engine               b) I want min/max for rate.               c) Increments             GR: I don't want the number of checkpoints to grow.             JG: One other issue - different speech rates may be required               for users with different disabilities. UAs may use               several technologies to meet requirements.             /* JG tries to get WG consensus */             JG: Can we pick a range and some increments?               - P1 requirement shall include a range and increments.             GR: Best way to meet the needs of all the users is               to give access to the full range. The range is               a clarification.             DP: I think that we need to make all three of GR's               points P1. I don't want anything to get lost.             EH: I agree with IJ's explanation. I would encourage               us to be cautious to get the best advice we can about               what the range is.             DP: Consider pitch. If you deal with pitch, different               synthesizers with different voices deal with pitch               differently. If you set a range for pitch, results               may not be accessible to some users.             EH: I propose P1 for range + increment and P2 for               access to the full range.             DP: I think that not having control in some cases               might preclude access.             CMN: I instinctively agree with IJ. If you say that               800 is enough for accessibility, then more than               800 is more than enough. But we don't have a                mathematical understanding of what is required               for accessibility. 800 would not be a hard line.               If you don't give access to the capabilities of               people's tools, you're going to cut people out.               People might implement stuff that only a few               people need. There may be a pretty good case               for saying: this is the conservative range               (and if you don't do this, life will be impossible)               and furthermore, you should give them everything               that's possible.             JG: I agree with CMN - as soon as you pick numbers,               you lock someone out.              CMN: You can guarantee that we're not going far               enough to meet the needs of some people.             JG Proposed: Two checkpoints:              - Control and configure rate (within range, with increment)              - Access to the range of values of speech synth parameters                (add this to 4.11 - include additional values beyond                 the range). Add to this checkpoint full control                 of what's available to the synthesizer.             GR: I would switch the priorities: control is P1. The               range is normative as well.              DP: I agree with GR's proposal.             RS: I agree with JG's proposal.           DB: I can't support GR's proposal.           HB: I would prefer two checkpoints.          CMN: I would support GR and DP's position with the               proviso that I would looking for a small range               being the required range.            GR: Yes, I can agree with that.           IJ: That's consistent with CMN's all content stubbornness.          CMN: If we set a range where we're pretty sure we catch               everyone, then I'm sure we will exclude some people.               "Provide access to the full rate of speech available               in the speech synthesizer, going down to [100] and up               to [500]. People can live on 400. It's not ideal for               a bunch of people.           IJ: EH, can you live with this proposal?           EH: I'm concerned that it may be weakening the requirement.           JG: Arkenstone goes from 120-350. Increment: 10 wpm.           DP: A percentage may be better.           EH: I think it's tricky to have an open-ended requirement;               are we willing to tolerate this type of conformance.               What is the requirement to cover the full range?                      Resolved:                  "Provide access to the full rate of speech rates available               in the speech synthesizer, going down to [120?] and up               to [500?], increments of 10 wpm?      Resolved action items:        1.IJ: Produce a new draft that folds minimal requirements into the             checkpoints. Should be ready about 7 July.        2.IJ: Pick up GR's action item to send out a request for information  on   speech synthesizer mins/maxes for various articulation capabilities (as  we   did for speech        rate).        Status: Done      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0000.html        5.GR: Pursue speech synth ranges for other properties than speech            rate.        Status: Done, will done.        4.GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples  in             the techniques document.         Status: Dropped. May do.      Open action items:        IJ: Moving along!          3.IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers.             (No deadline.)          6.GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and see whether they  can            be clarified to account for control of rendering of audio            (and possibly other content) on load.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Yes, you can "browser sniff" to tailor your content to a particular  browsers abilities. But you should still send well-structured content  and use style sheets.  Please refer also to W3C's work on CC/PP.    http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CCPP     > Checking that a page looks good without the CSS is more work which  > people working with dynamic web pages can avoid.    I think that people do a lot of work with just HTML anyway, and  scripting  languages, too. I wish it were easier and that CSS and the DOM were   implemented well. That would reduce the author's work significantly.  But resorting to misused HTML will not solve the problem, only   perpetuate it.      > The issue of accessibility of applets, scripts, moving text, etc, can be  > simplified by creating different versions of the web page.

I don't understand this conclusion. I think tailoring content to the  capabilities of the device is a good thing, but that should be done  by machines, not humans. The principles of the guidelines are, in my  opinion, entirely separate from the issue of how content is produced.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I've published the 9 March UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]   and Techniques [2]. Changes are online [3] and quoted   as text below.    Please review this draft!    I *strongly* encourage you to review this draft of the document.  We have resolved all of our last call issues and I don't   anticipate any other major changes to the document   (unless your review reveals significant problems).    The Working Group agree in the next couple of weeks that   we are done and wish to advance to last call (after which  I get to prepare the document for our third last call).    --------------------------  Important things to review  --------------------------    1) Please review addition to checkpoint 4.5 about     playing audio during fast advance/reverse.    2) Please review checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, 4.15. I rely     on the expertise of the group to get the wording     of these speech requirements right.    3) Please review the first 7 checkpoints of Guideline 9;     I think they look great!    4) Please compare 9.2 and 9.7 and see whether the difference     is sufficiently clear.    5) Please check out definitions of animation, enabled element,     interactive element, and focus.    6) Pleae review checkpoint 2.4 (new wording and new alert     requirement).    7) Check out the new section on how to refer to this document.    -------------  What's next?  -------------     * Add executive summary     * Address concern about "contradictory" statements of     checkpoints 1.1/1.2     * Al Gilman may have some suggestions for us about     issue 464 [4] (How to account for captions in SMIL).     * Now that we have resolved last call issues, I must     respond to all last call reviewers to see whether     they are satisfied or wish to register objections.     * The Techniques document needs to be read!     * The implementation report needs to be updated. I predict     that we now have requirements for which we have no     implementation experience, and we will need to      concentrate on these during Candidate Recommendation     (if we need to go to CR).    ------  Trivia  ------  By the way, for those keeping score at home, this is the  fifty-fifth (55) draft of the Guidelines. Let's stop (at  Rec) when we hit 60.

Introduction of term "Interactive element".  * Editorial: Some changes based on comments from Aaron Leventhal. In    particular, changed "must" to "needs to" in a number of places    (e.g., guidelines prose, techniques) to avoid impression that    required for conformance.    Introduction    * 1.3 (Known limitations): Added a limitation that there is no    requirement in this document for all user interface components to    be under final user control; this is covered to a large extent in    Guideline 5 and also in other software guidelines.    Guidelines    * Guideline 4 split into Guidelines 4 and 5. Moved checkpoints about    control of UI behavior to new Guideline 5.  * Guideline 5 split into Guidelines 6 and 7.    Checkpoints    * 2.4: Checkpoint wording changed per 1-2 March face-to-face.    Added alert requirement as well. Please review. ( issue 460).  * 2.5: Changed from "allow the user to specify" to "allow the user    to configure or control".  * 3.2: Content type "Animation", not "Image". But leave video as    well.  * 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7: Changed "video and animations" to "animations    (including video and animated images)" per proposal from Ian    adopted at 8 March teleconf.  * 4.5: Important Based on discussion at 1-2 March face-to-face,    added the following statement: "The user agent is not required to    play synchronized audio during fast advance or reverse of    animations (though doing so may help orient the user)."  * 4.13, 4.14, 4.15: Important These are derived from one single    checkpoint per 1-2 March face-to-face resolution. These    checkpoints need review! (Didn't do much to move techniques around    yet.)  * 5.1, 5.2, 5.3: Changed per proposal from Ian, adopted at 8    March teleconf.  * 6.5: (Editorial) Selection and focus are no longer part of "UI    controls".  * 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7: Now form a coherent    content-focus navigation model (among viewports and among enabled    elements and among history). Changed per proposal from Ian    (adopted at 8 March teleconf) in conjunction with resolutions    from 1-2 March face-to-face.  * 9.1: Removed this Note: "Navigation among all viewports implies at    least allowing the user to cycle through all viewports."  * 9.2, 9.7: Based on comments from Aaron Leventhal, attempt at    making the differences between these two checkpoints more apparent    (note that the first sentence is the same in both, but the other    two differ).  * 9.8: Clarification about where the default search starting point    should be (when user has not indicated). Based on resolution from    1-2 March face-to-face.  * 10.7: No longer talks about current viewport; instead viewport    with current focus. Changed per proposal from Ian (adopted at    8 March teleconf).  * 11.4: Browser history is not required, so history stage change    bindings moved to "if supported" section.  * 12.2, 12.5: Edits to Notes based on comments from Harvey    Bingham.    Conformance    * Applicability: Added some comments about event bubbling to third    applicability provision.  * 3.5 Responsibility for Claims: Changed wording from "anyone may    make a claim" to "this spec imposes no restrictions about who may    make a claim".  * 3.1 (Content type labels): Made some adjustments based on    definition of Animation that includes Video and Animated Images.    In particular: Animated images are part of animation, not images.    The goal was to have video/image/animation conformance overlap as    little as possible. Also adjusted Speech label based on two new    speech checkpoints.    Glossary    * New term: "Animation" (per 8 March discussion.  * New term: "Enabled element"  * New term: "Interactive element"  * Deleted term: "active element"  * Deleted term: "current viewport"  * Per 1-2 March face-to-face, changes to the terms "focus"    (content focus and user interface focus), "selection", "point of    regard".  * "Event handlers": Added "An event handler is 'explicitly    associated with an element' when the event handler is associated    with a particular element through markup or the DOM."    References    * New section "How to refer to this document". Distinguishes this    version from latest version. Gives sample HTML markup.  * Added [SMIL20]  * Fixed some cross-linking bugs between Guidelines and Techniques    pointed out by Harvey Bingham.    Techniques    * 2.7: Added some examples of "required" conditional content.  * 3.5: Added technique to configure-content refresh based on CMN    example.  * 4.4, 4.5: Added some techniques for doing this in SMIL 2.0. Added    some info about applicability and streaming. Added techniques    pointing to digital talking books information.  * 5.1, 5.2: Some techniques added.  * 5.5: Suggest warning user that some fee mechanisms may not be    "caught" in this configuration. Added per 1-2 March    face-to-face resolution.  * 6.1: Added rationale about advantage of access to source content    to ATs (rather than offscreen access).  * 9.9: Added some comments about where important information is    identified from (e.g., specs, metadata).  * 12.3: Added a technique to document where UA diverges from system    conventions.

If you mean that for style alone, then  ok. But "new" suggests semantics and what's needed is some semantic  description:    a) In a spec like for HTML (for "new" in HTML use INS).  b) A new element + a schema.     I don't think "class" names convey semantics effectively without  a formal mechanism for assigning meaning. How else is the machine  to guess what it means?

      Hello,    Here's a proposal:    1) We say something like this:           Non-visual users often "get lost" in lists, especially those with      several layers of embedding and those that do not indicate the      specific level of indentation for each item. Content developers are      encouraged to use UL for unordered lists and OL for ordered lists      (i.e., use markup appropriately).  However, until user agents  provide      a means to identify list context clearly (e.g., by supporting the      ':before' pseudo-element in CSS2), content developers should      consider including contextual clues in their lists.    2) We talk about a CSS2 solution:         The following CSS2 style sheet shows how to provide compound  numbers       for nested lists created with either UL or OL elements.       Items are numbered as "1", "1.1", "1.1.1", etc.         <STYLE type="text/css">          UL, OL { counter-reset: item }          LI { display: block }          LI:before { content: counters(item, "."); counter-increment:  item }       </STYLE>    3) We talk about a CSS1 solution:          Until either CSS2 is widely supported by users agents or user        agents allow users to control rendering of lists through other  means,        authors should consider providing contextual clues in nested         lists. The following CSS1 mechanism shows how to hide the        end of a list when style sheets are turned on, and to reveal        it when style sheets are turned off, when user style sheets        override the hiding mechanism, or when style sheets aren't        supported.              <STYLE type="text/css">            .endoflist { display: none }          </STYLE>         <UL>           <LI>Paper:              <UL>                <LI>Envelopes                <LI>Notepaper                <LI>Letterhead                <LI>Poster paper                   <span class="endoflist">(End of Paper)</span>             </UL>          <LI>Pens:               <UL>                <LI>Blue writing pens                <LI>whiteboard pens                 <span class="endoflist">(End of Pens)</span>              </UL>         <LI>Fasteners:               <UL>                <LI>paper clips                <LI>staples                <LI>Big lengths of rope.                 <span class="endoflist">(End of Fasteners)</span>              </UL> <span class="endoflist">(End of Office  Supplies)</span>        </UL>                Note: This example does not help the case of wrapping          list items. With some more effort, the author          could put similar markup at the end of each list          item.              Question: Perhaps it's also helpful to use this mechanism              at the beginning of each list to say how              many items are in the list. Any thoughts?

      Gregory, Janina, Peter, George, and others,    In an attempt to clearly identify what user agents must to do   conform to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, the Working  Group has been investigating the "minimal requirements" of the  document (you can track our progress online [1]). This email is  about identifying the minimal requirements for user agents that  synthesize speech.    On 15 June, Gregory sent data to the Working Group about the slowest  and fastest speech rates of several tools [2]: Eloquence for  Jaws, ViaVoice, Orpheus, and Microsoft Speech Engine. This is very  useful information and real-world data is just what we need to advance  our document.     In the 10 June Working Draft of the Guidelines [3], checkpoint 4.11  reads:        Allow the user to configure synthesized speech pitch, gender,      and other articulation characteristics.    At its 15 June teleconference, the Working Group resolved to delete  the ambiguous "and other articulation characteristics" and the more  specific checkpoint will read:        Allow the user to configure synthesized voice gender, pitch,       pitch range, stress, and richness.    We are seeking real-world values for these characteristics in speech  synthesizers. It would greatly help the Working Group if anyone familiar  with speech synthesizer technology could send information to this   list about the relevant capabilities of today's technologies.    Your contributions are greatly appreciated! Please note that we  are also examining the range of values described in chapter 19  (Aural Style Sheets) of the CSS2 Recommendation [4].

      NOTE: Please continue discussion on w3c-wai-ua only. I would like  for futher discussion to take place on one list only.    Hello,    I received an action item in several different groups (CG [1], AU [2],   UA [3]) to propose a single conformance mechanism for  all three WAI Guidelines. The text of the proposal [0]  is based on the experience of the WCAG 1.0 Recommendation,  discussions since then in all of the Guidelines WGs, and review  by the WAI Team.    Please note the following excerpt, which addresses the  question of "who validates conformance claims". It says:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Claimants (or relevant assuring parties) are responsible for the   validity of a claim. As of January 2000, W3C does not act as   an assuring party, but it may do so in the future, or establish   recommendations for assuring parties.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    Feedback on this proposal is encouraged. I expect to add, in   a future version of the document, a sample claim using RDF.

Hi Gregory,    I'm not sure what action to take based on your comment.    1) Do you mean that Netscape should be told that their UA is  not accessible through the keyboard?    2) Do you mean that inclusion of the NN binding table suggests  that NN is accessible but it's not?    3) Do you mean that we should say explicitly in the Techniques  Document that NN is not accessible?    I think one is a good idea. Two is a possibility, but I don't  think necessary. Three I don't agree with.    If there is an action item to figure out about keyboard access  to the help system, I'm unaware of it since it's not indicated in   the minutes of [1] as an action item.

But asking user  agents to recognize classes that are not defined in the HTML  specification  is problematic to me. It could be done - the UA Guidelines could require  that conforming user agents handle some predefined classes in a special  way - but I think that the HTML spec is the appropriate place for this  type of information.    > 3. defining conventions for titles  (well, I gotta have a third alternative)    <grin>      > As you might guess, my vote is for 2, defining conventions for class  > names.

Here's a nice HTML trick that works with Lynx:  Define links to key parts of a page with the LINK element        <link rel="start" href="#headline" title="Go to headline |"/>      <link rel="contents" href="#contents" title="Go to table of contents  |"/>      <link rel="index" href="#search" title="Search"/>       Lynx renders these as links, but they do not show up on most     graphical browsers. Thus the author can create skip-over links     even if the UA doesn't support structured navigation to or     past groups of links.     - Ian         > Note that even if we wait for XML, that just postpones deciding on the  > semantic units.

      Hello,    Issue 142 [1] is concerned with ambiguities about checkpoint 1.5,  which in the 15 January 2000 draft [2] reads:    <OLD>  1.5 Ensure that all messages to the user (e.g., informational messages,      warnings, errors, etc.) are available through all output device APIs      used by the user agent. Do not bypass the standard output APIs when      rendering information (e.g., for reasons of speed, efficiency,  etc.).      [Priority 1]   </OLD>    At the 19 January teleconf [3], we discussed some of the ambiguities:    1) What really does "all output device APIs" include? Does that     include an API for the printer? If a sound device is supported,     does that mean that text messages must be available as a series     of beeps?    2) The second sentence of the checkpoint emphasizes how the requirement     of checkpoint 1.2 applies here: use the standard input and output     device APIs.    I believe there are two goals for this checkpoint:     Intention 1) For supported output devices, don't work around                standard output APIs. I believe this goal                is covered by checkpoint 1.2     Intention 2) User agents must ensure that messages to                 the user are available in redundant modes               (text, speech, graphical).     How does the second intention interact with other checkpoints?    1) Checkpoint 5.2 requires that UAs make available UI information      programmatically.    2) Checkpoint 9.1 requires notification of changes in content and     the UI (or should be expressed that way). Messages to the user     surely count as changes to the UI.    3) Checkpoint 9.1 does not address redundant forms of output. This     is the purpose of 1.5. Note that checkpoint 1.1 talks about     how device independence applies to other checkpoints, but checkpoint     1.5 does not.    4) Checkpoint 5.6 requires (Priority 2) the user of conventions for     UI design.    Therefore, I propose the following changes:    Proposal 1) Modify Checkpoint 1.5 to read:             Ensure that the user interface provides information           through redundant output channels.                 Note. For example, if a sound is used to indicate                     a change to the user, provide that information                     as text and graphical information as well.                     Refer also to checkpoint 9.1              I think it should also be noted that if the standard UI            controls are accessible, then using standard UI controls            will satisfy this checkpoint.     Proposal 2) Move the second sentence of 1.5 to the note after 1.2    Proposal 3) Change checkpoint 9.1 from:           <OLD>             9.1 Provide information about user agent initiated content  and viewport                changes through the user interface and through APIs  [Priority 1]          </OLD>           to:           <NEW>             Notify the user of user agent initiated content changes.         </NEW>           We can remove the requirement "and through APIs" because  checkpoint         5.4 covers it:                Provide programmatic notification of changes to content and  user              interface controls (including selection, content focus, and  user              interface focus).           That means that the new 9.1 would only be about notification  through         the user interface, which is what Guideline 9 says: "Notify the         user of content and viewport changes".       Other comments:     My action item from [3] also suggested information in the Techniques  document about the varying degrees of importance in messages.  I'm not sure where that would fit in to this proposal.     - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#142  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG-20000115  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0124.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,     Per my action of the 15 June teleconference [1], please  consider the following proposal. In the 10 June guidelines,  we have the following checkpoints:    3.3 Allow the user to freeze video.  3.5 Allow the user to freeze animated or blinking text.  3.6 Allow the user to freeze animations and blinking images.  4.6 Allow the user to start, stop, pause, advance, and rewind audio,      video, and animations.     All of these checkpoints are Priority 1. Recall that in previous  versions of the document, checkopints 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 read  "turn on and off" instead of "freeze", but I believe that the  accessibility  issue in cases of animated text, animated images, and video is the  motion  (and not the mere visual information).     For the purposes of this email, I consider that "freeze" is a  subset of "pause". With "pause" the user agent is required to allow  "play" again; with "freeze", there is no requirement to play again.    Therefore, since checkpoint 4.6 already includes video and animations  (which I interpret to be animated images and text), and it requires  a pause functionality that is more powerful than a simple freeze, and  the checkpoints are all priority 1, I propose that checkpoints 3.3, 3.5  and 3.6 all be deleted in favor of the following two checkpoints:    <NEW 1>     Allow the user to start, stop, and pause audio, video, and  graphically     animated and blinking content.  </NEW 1>    <NEW 2>     Allow the user to advance and rewind audio, video, and graphically     animated content.  </NEW 2>    I have opted for two checkpoints since I'm not sure that it's necessary  to advance and rewind blinking content. While this could be considered  a degenerate case of animated content, it may confuse people.

This is covered by the following statement in 5.1:       They apply to alternative representations of content as well     as primary content.     Note that alternative representations of content include captions.

Proposed: Add a cross-reference from checkpoint 4.5 to Guideline  3 of WCAG (Use markup and style sheets and do so properly.).     4.5 Allow the author to transform presentation markup that is misused to  convey              structure into structural markup, and to transform  presentation markup             that is stylistic into style sheet  markup..

      Hello,    In certain cases, the author may "take over" parts of the  user agent's user interface. I'm thinking specifically  of the status bar (are there others?). What should UAAG 1.0  say about this? This is content that is rendered through the  user interface, but should our "content" requirements apply  here (e.g., stop blinking, change foreground and background   colors) or just our UI requirements (e.g., text equivalent  for messages, follow OS conventions)?    It is my opinion that since these checkpoints involve  the user agent's user interface (even though it's being  manipulated by the author), and the UA's UI is under  the full control of the UA developer, then only the   UI requirements should apply, notably checkpoint 5.13  (follow OS conventions).     I also think that WCAG should say something about  this, although I'm not sure what yet. I don't know  enough about whether it causes problems for users.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010126/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

From section 18.2.3 of HTML 4.01 [1]:      "The onfocus event occurs when an element receives focus either by the      pointing device or by tabbing navigation."

      WAI User Agent Guidelines Teleconference  19 May 1999    Chair: Jon Gunderson (from Madison)  Scribe: Ian Jacobs    Present:  Marja Koivunen  Harvey Bingham  Chris Weaver (New Mexico State)  Madeleine Rothberg (WGBH)  Mark Novak    Agenda   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0125.html    ACTIONS:    - (NEW) Action Chris: Write up Math techniques proposal and post to  mailing                    list. MR to review this.    - (NEW) Action editors: Incorporate resolutions into next draft of  document.    - IJ: Write DJW about requirements T&S/WAI.    Wrote twice, no reply. Will follow up.    (Continue All IJ actions)    - CMN: Write techniques for 7.2.2 and 7.2.6    CMN deferred until publication of NOte by Rich and Mark.    Probably continued.    - JG: Techniques for 7.2.2.    Not done.    - JG: Techniques for 7.2.1.    Not done.    - JG: Contact Rob about 7.2.4/5/6    Rob hasn't been participating and we have consensus    on checkpoints in this section.     JG: I need to contact Rob about this. We want    TECHNIQUES that point to vendor-developed (internal)    guidelines. This for platform-specific conventions.    - JG: Contact Rich S. and Peter Korn for techniques.    JG: I contacted Rich but not Peter.     - JA: Check guidelines for information about tooltip control.    Not done.    - Editor: Group navigation by function.    IJ: We may have been here already. Will look into how this     would fit into the document.    - MK: Propose navigation checkpoint to time-sensitive    parts of a document.    MK: Not done.    JG: This is about navigation the SMIL tree or parts of     a multi-media presentation.    MK: If a link is time-dependent, allow the user to navigate    it independent of time.    JG: Review this in terms of stop/start/rewind/fast-forward  checkpoints.    CLOSED ACTIONS:    - HB: Checkpoint for metadata search.    HB: This became attribute-value search. But in addition,    give user information about attribute/value pairs.    IJ: Is this a good feature or a solution that requires users       to know even more about the document?    JB: HB should write a technique that shows how it's useful        for accessibility.    HB: Already done.    - JG: Add issue to issues list about "accesskey" recognition.    JG: I think I did that. On the mailing list, the conclusion    to proposals was not to have a checkpoint about support    for access keys. Instead, discuss it in HTML accessibility     features section. Implementation details    in the techniques document.    - JG: Organize Math discussion.    Done. Had discussion last week. On agenda this week.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0120.html    /* Brief discussion of presence of accessibility at WWW8 */    /*      Brief discussion of difficulty of getting UA Guidelines     to Recommendation   */    HB: This is where the rubber hits the road.    JG: People will buy into them when they start asking their tools      for support.    Agenda 1) Discusion and resolution of support of math  Issue #12: Recommend full implmentation of MathML http://cmos-  eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#12    JG: Three main conclusions:    a) Provide access to math document tree (preferably MathML).       Add this to current navigation techniques.    b) Recommend MathML if user agent/plug-in handles math.    c) Make math information available to assistive technologies       (e.g., XML tree).    MR: The alternative to MathML is that authors create graphical      images of math, which is problematic. Can't we encourage      MathML more strongly?     IJ: Checkpoint that says "If you do math, use MathML" and motivate      this instead of requiring authors to use images.    CW: What do we mean by "rendering" math?    IJ: I think that we mean prefer MathML as a markup language.    CW: What if a UA encounters a math document on the Web. Should      we recommend that UAs be able to read this, or is more      of the domain of plug-ins?    JG: In Web Content, this was discussed and conclusion was that      math and science are part of a larger framework.    IJ: The larger framework is "Use W3C Recommendations where available."      Maybe need a mirror checkpoint to "Implement applicable W3C      Recommendations".     JG: Say this in the Techniques document?     IJ: I think this can be said in guideline themselves.      E.g., may want to encourage support for deprecated features.      PROPOSAL: Review WCAG checkpoints. See if this group covers all      of them or needs to mirror them. Checkpoint 11.1, if mirrored      by UAGL, would cover MathML (which could be listed as an      example).    RESOLVED: Bring WCAG checkpoints from guideline 11 into      Guideline 7.1. In short, rework 7.1 based on that.      Ensure that Math is part of that as an example. SMIL      as well.    CW: Is a similar concern being taken to the AU WG?    JB: They will probably reference UAGL in this area.      Agenda 2) Issue #13: Provide keyboard access to MathML similar to forms  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#13    JG: What's between navigation of math document tree and navigation      of linear navigation of equation.    IJ: What about lower bound/upper bound of an integral?    JG: Linear is appropriate for simple equations. Need this for simple      situations and naive users. Discussion last week about some      middle ground. Maybe just talk about these two approaches      in techniques; this might be sufficient for math in this document.    CW: You need to get through a math tree unambiguously. Linear is     depth-first. Tree is a "node-announcing breadth-first search".     Users should be able to shrink or expand subtrees. Need clues     about what the children are (math nodes tend to be very sparse).     You may need to know about the depth of subtrees in order to     guess where to navigate.    IJ: I see the same techniques useful for, e.g., navigating      a document structure such as headers.    CW: Math is a somewhat special case due to sparseness. We should       be sure that the guidelines ensure that the tree structure     is apparent. Yes, it fits under a checkpoint about navigating     the document tree.    CONCLUSION: Just include math in current checkpoints.    Action CW: Write math technique proposal (with others if desired,      e.g., Raman and Gardner).    Action MR: Review this proposal.    Agenda 3) Issue #14: MathML objects should be included as part of the  document tree  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#14      JG: Ensure that we mention XML in checkpoint about exposing tree.    IJ: Do we need to say anything specific about math if it's covered      in sections on (1) Use W3C specs (2) Use the DOM?    HB: Need to mention entities/mapping to semantics.     User agent issue to      convert symbols into (notably spoken) rendering that is      part of the math terminology.        IJ: To me, I hear "semantics" and I think "schemas."     JB: Do we need to say "support schemas"?    IJ: Political issue right now about convergence of RDF and XML.    CW: If the author has made the spoken rendering available (e.g.,      through a schema), then the user agent should make that      information available to the user.    MK: What about the reading order?     JG: Is this a navigation issue? Or do we need to say something     about "when markup is available for content substitution, make     the content available".    IJ: Covered by 5.2.1. Perhaps ensure that namespaces included in      examples.    CW: MathML provides separate content markup for use by computation      engines. It's supposed to be included with the math and can      be passed around, e.g., for evaluation of expressions.    JG: Put details in techniques doc.       Agenda 4) Structural/Editorial changes to document (based on        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines experience)    RESOLVED: Adopt single-digit numbering of guidelines as per      WCAG. Push "structure" to introduction.    CW: I like single-digit number systems. They should agree      across guidelines for consistency.     IJ: Will be difficult to track changes in WCAG. I think this      WG should choose the most important and put them first.    RESOLVED: Move terms/definitions to a glossary at the end.

Because the definition of  "animation" includes "video", I was wondering whether  animation/video/image  content type labels should all refer to mutually exclusive sets of  checkpoints. In the end, for 3.2, I thought it best to leave  two content type labels: Animtion (for animated images), Video.    In general, I have been wondering whether animated images should  fall under the "Animation" label or the "Image" label or both.  I think that I prefer just under Animation given the nature  of the requirements (and the document reflects that).

Seems it should be made explicit...    IJ: I think that we limited our requirement to "alert" because the  issue was simply not knowing that you had wrapped. I don't think it's  as important a requirement to not wrap.    We haven't discussed what happens when a search terminates. Do you  have any proposals? I'm not sure we need to say anything.     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      12 December 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0373.html  Minutes of previous meeting November 30:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0364.html    Present:     Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs, Charles McCathieNevile,     David Poehlman, Tim Lacy, Mickey Quenzer, Jim Allan,     Eric Hansen, Gregory Rosmaita    Regrets:      Kitch Barnicle, Harvey Bingham    Absent:      Rich Schwerdtfeger    Next meeting: 12 December    Can attend: JA, IJ, JG, GR    May attend: MQ, CMN    JG: I will send out information abou this extra meeting.    =============  Announcements  =============        1.Next User Agent face-to-face meeting in Boston on 1-2 March 2001        IJ: Details of plenary session (weds) on Advisory Board agenda.    ==========  Discussion  ==========     1.Joint meetings with other WAI working groups at our next FTF in March     JG: DOM, Mobile, CSS. UI accessibility requirements? APIs?   JG: From PF face-to-face meeting earlier this week: accessibility       implementation requirements. Related to checkpoint 6.1. Today,       we point to Notes, but these haven't been reviewed by       Membership. Proposal that each new spec include a separate       section on accessibility features.     IJ: Proposed -       a) Need to read their specs.      b) Need to talk to Chairs. Time is precious, so we          need to get commitments from them to meet a specific         times.      c) If we meet with them ahead of time, we may have         an easier time coming up with an agenda.     MQ: We also need to see whether they have issues with us.     IJ: That's what last call is supposed to do.        IJ: Advisory Board talked about cross-fertilization at the   plenary week: people listening at other meetings. IPR and   confidentiality issues.     /* Ian notes that Philippe Le H?garet is now chair of DOM WG */     IJ: Write proposals to Chairs of WGs to schedule meetings.   Mention in particular UI and API issues. Ask them what specs   we should review in preparation.     Action JG: Schedule face-to-face time with other WGs.     3.Issue #399: Checkpoint 4.7: Implementation experience for this?      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#399     IJ: I don't know that we have implementation experience for this   checkpoint.     JG: I spoke to someone from Gallaudet about this issue. She said the   only technology she knew of was from ATI (the "all-in-one   card"). Let's you put characters encoded in the video signal in a   separate window and position that window.   http://www.ati.com/     JG: The other issue that came up earlier this week: most formatting   for captioning seems to be proprietary.      IJ: I don't hear any new information here.     JG: I think in a response to the reviewer, perhaps just clarify   that this is for markup languages that support positioning.     CMN: Support for captioning positioning is the same as support   for CSS positioning. And there are plenty of implementations   available.     JG: I recommend that we talk to WGBH about implementation experience.     Action JA: Review SMIL players to find out which ones support   positioning of captions.     Action JG: Talk to Cindy King about captioning.     Action GR: Talk to AFB about captioning and positioning.     EH: What about the priority? The more the document is aimed at   a wide range of UAs (e.g., those with small screens), this increases   the likelihood of some content being obscured.     Resolution: No change.    - We don't have commitments from vendors to implement this.    - We are looking for implementation experience (e.g., for SMIL).    - Please note that if a format doesn't support positioning      of captions, the UA doesn't require user control over the      position.    - We maintain the P1 requirement.     Action IJ: Respond to Greg Lowney     4.Issue #400: Checkpoint 4.11: Why limited to sources      synchronized to play simultanously?      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#400      IJ: The answer is that when sound not synchronized, global volume    requirement suffices.  UA developers may implement independent    control for all sources of audio (but minimal requirement is just    for synchronized sources).      Resolved: No change.        Action IJ: Add a clarifying note to 4.11 that if you allow    independent control of all sources of audio, you satisfy the    checkpoint as well.     5.Issue #401: Checkpoint 4.12: Split checkpoint with minreqs in a  separate      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#401     GR: I think that an ancillary issue is that for UAs that don't   support synth speech, allowing access to all of the speech engine   falls under the rubrique of "do no harm". We don't want UAs to    cut out functionality.     JG: Issue of a built-in speech engine interfering with the user's   speech engine.     Resolved:     - This issue is subsumed by resolution of issue 328       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-328     - We talked about the general topic of UAAG 1.0 requirements       applied to the UI as part of issue 3.8, discussed at 30        November teleconf:        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0364.html     - Indicate in checkpoint 5.8 techniques the problem of        conflicts between synthesized speech engines - notably on        multitasking systems.       Action JG: Propose text for the techniques document about       synthesized speech implementation issues.     6.Issue #402: Checkpoint 4.12: Problem with incremental change (e.g.,      for one wpm case)      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#402     Resolved:     - This issue is subsumed by resolution of issue 328       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-328     7.Issue #403: Checkpoint 4.12: Need to require override of       author-specified speeds.      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#403     IJ: The proposal is a checkpoint to ensure that the user can   override author-specified speech speeds. Do people understand 4.12   to include override?     IJ: Is this an element-level override requirement or a global   requirement?     MQ: Speech that can come from other sources while you're using your   screen access features.     DP: Speech synths may be controlled within a document by embedding   text commands in the content. Speech engines do whatever they're told   to do in the source.     JG: I think that author-specified element-level speech changes would   be stylistic changes.     GR: Two levels of granularity - what the hardware can do (manipulable   through machine codes), and shortcuts that allow you to specify   different rates for different documents.      JG: Some control sequences hard-coded in content to control a   particular speech engine.      GR: That's like painting to the screen - can't be interrupted on the   fly.      JG: More advanced user agents let you specify different rates for   different windows, objects, content.      IJ: Do any speech engines today let users override author-provided   control codes?      MQ: No.     /* Ian note that emacsspeak imlements ACSS, which allows user     control on an element-level */     IJ: User override of author-supplied speech rate suggests a   content transformation.     IJ: Seems like enabling user override is not a UA issue but   a speech engine issue - if the speech engine doesn't allow it,   or the format fed to the engine doesn't, then user can't do it.   If the question is moved to the UA realm (e.g., in style sheets),   then conformance covers our requirements.     Resolved: No change to checkpoint.     - If speech engine allows user override, that's the speech       engine's functionality, not the UAs.     - We don't require content transformations to strip them       out before sending to the speech engine.     Action IJ: Add technique to checkpoint 4.12 to make clear that:    - This includes author-override if speech engine allows.    - This includes whatever granularity offered by speech engine.     8.Issue #404: Checkpoint 4.16 (4.17, 8.2): Font requirement      implies big performance hit, reflow.      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#404      IJ: Did we go too far with our minimal requirements in adding fonts?    Remember that we discussed this as part of issue 353:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-353      IJ: What about low vision - is bigger font useful in this case?    Who benefits from the font case?      JG: A big selection might be disorienting (if repagination).    I think that other characteristics of a font (e.g., underlining or    bold) may be useful.      JA: I've implemented this. Even with bold, there may be    reformatting. I have concerns about the font requirement as well.      JA: In Windows, you can control colors/fonts at OS level and    UA inherits them.      JG: Opera offers border as highlight mechanism.      JA: I think that text decoration suffices for users with low    vision. Color suffices for many users with low vision. It's more    critical than text style, and in many cases, changing the font    style is disorienting.      JG: I would agree.      DP: Some ATs (e.g., Jaws, Outspoken) relies on link color    information.      Resolved:      - For checkpoints 4.16, 4.17, 8.2, 8.3, remove the minimal font       requirement since accessibility benefit uncertain. (The performance       hit is a separate issue.)     - If fonts are used for highlighting in any of these       four checkpoints, user must be able to configure        the text decoration characteristics (but not font family and       font size due to reflow issues).     - The highlighting mechanism must not rely on color alone (per issue  353)     - For four checkpoints, default highlights must be different.     9.Issue #405: Checkpoint 4.17: Need stronger requirement to distinguish      selection/focus      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#405     JG: Already today, user agents assign a priority to focus and   selection. So the final formatting depends on that priority.     CMN: There's another piece to this - when you're actually selecting   something, it concurrently has selection and focus.      Action JG: Write a proposal to the WG this week for a checkpoint   about discerning focus from selection all the time.    ===================  Action Item Summary  ===================    Completed Action Items:     10.IJ: Talk to the Director about DOM 2 proposal discussed at FTF  meeting     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0352.html       33.JG: Ask PF people, especially Rich, about user agents that      implement mouse events like mouse over with the keyboard next week       at ER-PF FTF.         JG: Haven't asked RS yet. PF people didn't know of any  implementations.    Dropped Action Items:       32.CMN: Send a proposed definition of equivalent to the group         IJ: This has been subsumed by my action item.

      Checkpoint 2.5.1 in [1] reads:      "The tool must recognize accessibility markup for any language      or format that it imports or converts. "    What does "recognize" mean? I'm not sure what this checkpoint  is meant to ensure. Does this mean:    1) The markup must be supported according to specification.  2) All features of the markup language (or format) that are known     to relate to accessibility must be supported.     (This sounds like 2.2.1).

Notes are not authoritative. This one is longer than most, agreed,  and also contains more rationale than many of the notes. If it  is to be removed from the checkpoint, I propose moving to the  rationale.    >(plus, there is a typo in the note, which i have marked with a  > trailing [sic], as the 'r' is missing from the word "keystroke")    Fixed.     > therefore, i would like to ask the chair, editor, and fellow WG members to  > reconsider my proposed verbiage for the note   for checkpoint 11.3  >   > 11.3 Document the default input configuration for the user agent.

The proposal was to push control of spawned windows (5.11  of [1]) to checkpoint 10.1:        10.1 Provide information about document and           viewport changes (to users and through          programming interfaces).

This suggests to me a guideline about user control of "processes"  that would include checkpoints about script execution, window  changes, form submission, etc. I'm afraid to go there. Do you have  any creative suggestions for how to stop short of a comprehensive  plan for managing process sprawl and cover the 5.11? (Yes,  I'm asking for a proposal.)     - Ian    P.S. I paraphrase you here: "If you won't be able to undo a change  with the back button, you should be prompted for the change." That  is interesting and I wonder how we might integrate it into the  guidelines.            

Hi Jon,    My summary was not a clear proposal because I hadn't finished  reflecting. Here are some more thoughts, though still incomplete.     I would like to remove navigation from the semantics where possible,  and instead use checkpoints to identify the accessibility goal.  Treat navigation as a technique where possible, then introduce  a couple of navigation checkpoints to ensure compatibility.    Please note that we've already done this for table cells. Navigation  and lineary rendering were both considered techniques for the  real goal: access to the information of an individual cell. I think  we can use the same logic in other places to reduce the number  of navigation checkpoints.    Therefore....    ON AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT:    1) Make element content available to the user. Priority 1, Both.    (Technique: use a viewport, allow different types of navigation.)    2) Make individual element content available to the user. Priority 1,  AT.     (Technique: e.g., use selection/focus for identification       of the element, use the DOM.).    ON AVAILABILITY OF METADATA:    I'm not sure how detailed these checkpoints should be. I think  to be verifiable, the checkpoints should be specific:  "Make available the following metadata for links: number of link, etc."  I'm not entirely convinced of these checkpoints yet.    ON ACTIVATION OF ACTIVE ELEMENTS:    3) Allow the user to activate any     active element -- links, form controls, elements with explicitly     associated event handlers. Priority 1, both.     (Technique: Navigate to elements, then activate. Or, activate     through keyboard shortcuts, menu interface, etc.)    4) Allow device-independent/keyboard activation. Priority 1, Both.    5) Allow the user to turn on/off     support for types of active elements (e.g., don't navigate     elements with event handlers). Priority 2, Both.    ON NAVIGATION and SEARCHING      6) Allow the user to sequentially navigate selected element types.     NOTE: This includes frames, tables, block elements, etc. P2    7) Allow the user to configure sets for sequential navigation. P2    8) Allow the user to navigate the document tree. P2     (Technique: Use the DOM)    9) The user agent should allow the user to search for elements based     on text content. P2    10) The user agent should allow the user to search for attributes     based on their values. (Which ones?)

      Hello,    Eric Hansen and I had a discussion recently about some of the   concerns that he expressed in a 5 September email [1] entitled   "Scoring Example User Agents, etc." In particular we discussed:    1) Usability of UAAG 1.0:     How to improve the UAAG 1.0 to make it easier to     make claims and to evaluate them (so that people     don't mistakenly compare apples and oranges).    2) Minimal content/rendering requirements:     Must the subject of a conformance claim support      all of audio, video, animations, and speech? (and     even Braille output?)    3) Further elimination of applicability provisions:     From section 3.4 [2], Eric felt that two of the applicability     provisions (one: content type, and four: output mode) are     problematic. Refer to previous analysis of applicability [3]     as well.    In light of ideas generated by the discussion, I'd like   to propose the following changes to the document that I   feel will address some of these issues.    1) Require that each conformance claim identify one or more sets     of checkpoints considered applicable beyond a core set.      These sets will bear the following labels and include      the following checkpoints (from the 1 September draft)      or portions of checkpoints:        - text:             4.1  (size of rendered text)            4.2  (font family)             3.4  (animated and blinking text)            4.14 (selection highlight with fonts)            4.15 (focus highlight with fonts)            8.2 (recent link highlight with fonts)            8.3 (fee link highlight with fonts)        - color:             4.3 (text foreground color)            4.4 (text background color)            4.14 (selection highlight with color)            4.15 (focus highlight with color)            8.3 (fee link highlight with color)        - audio:             2.4 (render auditory descriptions with                  primary audio content)            3.2 (don't render audio)            4.5 (slow audio)            4.6 (other controls of audio)            4.8 (global volume control)            4.9 (distinct source volume control)        - visual: text group checkpoints +            2.4 (render captions with primary video content)            3.1 (don't render background images)            3.3 (don't render video)            3.5 (blinking, animations)            3.9 (don't render images)            4.5 (slow video and animations)            4.6 (other controls of video and animations)            4.7 (control of captions, etc. on graphical displays)        - speech: 4.10, 4.11, 4.12        The core set of checkpoints will be all checkpoints minus     those listed above.        Notes:        - The "visual" set is a superset of "text".       - 10.8 doesn't need to be in this list, I think, since it             refers to the applicability of other checkpoints.       - 10.9 (for graphical UIs) already has applicability built-in.       Is this a substantive change to the requirements of the     document? I don't believe so, only a change to the      conformance mechanism. Here's why:        We already assume that as soon as a claim includes      satisfaction of one requirement related to     audio (for example), it must include satisfaction of     all requirements related to audio. Defining sets of     checkpoints and assigning labels to them helps in      several ways:         a) It helps developers, who don't have to hunt around          to find out which checkpoints they must satisfy for          audio.          b) It eliminates ambiguity: the WG chooses which          checkpoints they mean for each content type          or output mode. I think the choice of which          checkpoints go in which sets is easy (refer to          previous email with similar lists [4]).         c) Labels will simplify conformance claims and          make them shorter. For additional convenience,          we might include the label "all" so that people          can claim to satisfy all checkpoints. Note that          people will not have to use a checklist to show          checkpoints they consider inapplicable if there          aren't any beyond unsupported sets. It will           be sufficient to say "audio and visual support"          and the list of inapplicable checkpoints can be          deduced.         d) Meaningful labels will facilitate comparison of           claims. (Note: these labels are only in English;          I rely on external RDF for internationalization).       If this conformance proposal sounds familiar, you're     correct! In part. Refer to an earlier proposal about media     types from Ian [5] and one about UI profiles      from Al Gilman [6]. The current proposal      reintroduces the notions of "subsets", which was a very      sticky topic back in 1998. However,     the current proposal differs in that the subsets      proposed here are already in the document -- to find     out how to apply the applicability provision about     content type (e.g., audio), claimants must search     for all the checkpoints with the word "audio" in them     and identify the set themselves. Note also that there     is no discussion of "native support" in the current      proposal.       It is NOT possible to claim to conform to a "core" set of      checkpoints alone, only to the core set plus at least      one or more sets of content/output-related checkpoints.      For further information on previous conformance      proposals, I recommend reading the summary that      I wrote in September 1998 [7].        Another comment: This proposal still means that someone     could claim "Level A" conformance and the information     about supported sets will not appear in the phrase     "Level A". We already require that claims include additional     information, so any valid "Level A" claim      must always be accompanied by information about supported     sets.        2) Delete applicability provisions one and four     (content type, output mode). They are no longer required     due to the labels.    3) Eric had requested that all user agents be required to     implement all content types (images, audio, video, etc.).     Instead, we can now require the following: for each     named set of checkpoints in the claim (e.g., "audio"), we     require the user agent to implement at least one     specification to support that content type.        I think this is a reasonable thing to require: If the claim     is that the subject supports audio, the subject      must in fact support audio.     4) State (in the section describing the proposed labels)     that this document has been designed for user agents that     satisfy the "visual" and "audio" and "color" sets. This document     places less emphasis on the "speech" set and no emphasis on     Braille output, even though the document does not forbid     conformance claims for such user agents.     - Ian    [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0355.html  [2]http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000901/#applicable    [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/08/uaag10-applic  [4]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0356.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0342.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0344.html  [7] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0433.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Unsure: MQ, EH    Phone: JA, DP    ----------  Discussion  ----------    1.Coordination of joint meetings with DOM and CSS    ------  Issues  ------    1. Issue 449: Executive summary.     Action JG: Send an outline of what should be in a summary.   Action EH: Send thoughts on what should be in a summary.   Action IJ: Write an executive summary appendix.    2.Issues 358, 359, 322, 321, 394 postponed.     These should be resolved after EH, AG, and IJ finish     action item regarding checkpoint 2.3 and some definitions.    3.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse)        specific events.    Source:  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443    Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific    controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do    everything through the mouse.    Discussion:    a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings        specified by the author?    b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events        through the keyboard benefits the user?     TL: Scripting languages already provide for keyboard initiation   of mouse-specific events. I think pretty strongly that this is   an authoring issue.     TL: Another way to fix this - bind some keyboard sequence to   send a mouse event. It sounds easy on the surface, but it becomes   complicated: where to you send the event? We don't think this repair   should be done by the browser.     MQ: My end-user reaction is that the problem won't get solved this   way.      TL: But I don't think you should apply a complex solution to   a problem that has a simple solution on the author side.     MQ: Do Web page checkers identify these problems?     JG: I don't think they do much.     IJ: Note that this relates to including explicit event   handlers in the list of active elements. If we're not requiring   UAs to allow users to activate with the keyboard mouse-specific   events, then should the mouse-specific events be in the list   of active elements?     JG: Good point.     Summarizing:    - Either the UA does transformations of device-dependent      to device-independent and these are included in active      element list.    - Or exclude device-dependent handlers from list of       active elements.    - The UA is not required to repair author supplied       interaction that is device dependent.     JG: Transforming mouse-to-keyboard could be a lower priority   requirement.     Proposal:    - Exclude device-dependent interaction that is specified by the      author from the requirements of checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 7.3, 7.4    - Include a lower priority requirement for repairing author      specified device-dependent interaction.     JG: Since we don't have any implementation experience, we don't   know whether this will actually help users. We don't know whether   requiring repair will help accessibility; it may be more disorienting   than helpful.     /* IJ summarizes interdependences among WAI WGs and responsibilities      of each party. The question here is whether we want to ask      developers to repair device-specific handlers */     DP: I wouldn't ask UAs to do spell-checking on the fly either.     EH: I think I would support reducing the repair requirements here.     /* EH leaves */     JG: Frequent use of roll-overs is to dynamically changes images;   basically a visual stylistic effect (so not critical for all users).     DP: My understanding is that if you use mouse keys, you have similar   issues - you don't slide over, you move to (it's more like tabbing   more than rolling over).     /* Rich arrives */      RS: I think that you need to be able to navigate to elements with   event handlers associated.      IJ: I have fears about removing this repair; we might have       to go back to last call since this is eliminating a piece       of an accessibility requirement (even through repair).     JG: Has HPR tried repair techniques for this?     RS: I don't know, but I don't think that you can activate       mouse-specific events through the keyboard.     /* The WG reviews the MS home page, which uses pull-down menus. MS      home page provides pull-down menus, but if not supported, makes      available the same links one page away. */     MQ: I am willing to agree that this is an authoring problem. I'm not   aware of implementations that simulate the mouse events.     JA: Some of the MS links are available, but not all of them. So the   author has done an inconsistent job at ensuring that all links   are available.     RS: The HPR people haven't implemented repair yet. I don't know   whether IE provides a means to execute the javascript.     DP: I may be wrong, but I think that JFW does with IE is that   it takes every available link and makes it available - all links   are made available (though not necessarily in the same order).     TL: The way the home page works - all of the links are in the   DOM; their display state changes.      /* Tim leaves */     RS: Today, screen readers don't do the repair because they   need a tie between the dom and what's rendered. Plus, IE   doesn't let you execute scripts that are attached to an element.   But today, you don't have the graphical rendering and the DOM   tied together.     JG: We already don't require control in the case of event   bubbling. I'm not sure that a further limitation to   device-independent handling is much more significant.     Action JG: Ask WAI PF/WAI ER/WAI CG about their experience              with repair of device-specific event handlers              and indicate that we are leaning towards lowering              the priority of repair here.   Action RS: Find out what HPR's intentions are re: repair              of device-specific event handlers.

      Hi Gregory,    What you propose below is that user agents bypass  the standard Windows task control mechanism (which is apparently  buggy). I have problems with this technique since it seems  to contract the checkpoint that requires user agents to  use standard controls of the operating system. If the Windows  mechanism is buggy, it should be fixed. I don't think we  should ask Windows UAs to reimplement something as basic  as the task navigation tool. Furthermore, this seems to  be out of scope for user agents - we should not require them  to track all Windows of the operating system.      - Ian    "Gregory J.

      Below is a summary of some options that have been  discussed by the WG. The Group must decide what system   it feels is the most appropriate: How will the document   be used to measure the accessibility of a User Agent?     NOTE: Unfortunately, I have no experience with the legal  contexts in which conformance might be tested, otherwise I  would propose the best solution right up front!    NOTE: In all of the scenarios below, prioritizing the  checkpoints is a good thing to let developers know which  ones are the most important. (Whether or not there should be  three levels is another story.)    FINAL NOTE: These aren't the only options, but I hope they  capture some of the issues we've been dealing with. Ideas  from each option may be mixed and matched as well.    Option 0) The document says nothing at all about      conformance. We let others decide how and when the     document will be used to measure accessibility.    Option 1) The document proposes a "test suite" that     should be used when determining conformance.     We let others decide how and when to interpret the     test suite.       The test suite would amount to a checklist where,      for each checkpoint, a UA developer could check:             a. Satisfied Natively             b. Satisfied through Assistive Technology                - For this option, we can specify whether                this means:                     i) The UA simply makes information                        available through a standard                        interface, or                      ii) The UA developers can show that                        they make the information available                        <em>and</em> that there are products                        on the market that may be acquired at                        reasonable cost that make use of the                        information and satisfy the                        checkpoint.             c. Not Applicable             d. Not Satisfied       Note that in as many cases as possible, a developer     should check off both "a" and "b". Options "c" and "d"     are mutually exclusive from "a" and "b".        One result of a test suite might be that conformance     becomes a comparison game: one UA is "more conforming"     than another because it's test suite results are more     satisfactory. Will this produce a race to the bottom     (all UAs are not very accessible but comparable)      or a race to the top (market and journalistic pressures      push all UAs towards high conformance since test suite     results may be published)?     Option 2) We define conformance in an open-ended,      common-sense manner, as in:        2.a) To conform, UAs must implement all Priority 1           checkpoints. However, they are not required to           implement checkpoints that are not applicable (e.g.,           because the UA does not support the indicated language            feature, user interface feature, content type,           etc.).       This could be modified, as in:       2.b)  To conform, UAs must implement all Priority 1           checkpoints. They are not required to           implement checkpoints that are not applicable, but           in those cases MUST make information available           through standard interfaces and be able to demonstrate           that, in conjunction with readily available products,           the checkpoint is satisfied.              (Recall that UAs SHOULD make information available            through standard interfaces in general.)           There could even be two levels of conformance:         i) Conforms natively by implementing all Priority 1 checkpoints.      ii) Conforms by satisfying some Priority 1 checkpoints natively          and others in conjunction with assistive technology.       Note that it may be necessary to "help" common sense by     stating precisely what functionality is expected from     the UA in the text of some checkpoints, as in       "For those UAs that render video natively..."     While it may not be necessary to make such statements generally     (e.g., we don't have to say "For those UAs that render     fonts natively..."), there may be some instances     where we can avoid confusion or add precision.        If, however, the text of every checkpoint ends up containing     such qualifications, we should consider Option 4 below.    Option 3) We define a hybrid system. For instance,      suppose we had a subset of Priority 1 checkpoints      (for fun, call them "Priority AAA") that were really important      for all User Agents and generic enough to be satisfied      by all User Agents. We might express conformance as follows:           a) All UAs must satisfy all the Priority AAA            checkpoints natively.                  b.i) UAs must also satisfy the applicable Priority 1            checkpoints (where applicable is defined as in             Option 2).          Variations on part "b" are also imaginable, including:           b.ii) UAs must also satisfy the applicable Priority 1                checkpoints natively or be able to demonstrate               that, in conjunction with readily available                products, the checkpoints are satisfied.     Option 4) We specify well-defined subsets of Priority 1      checkpoints so that conformance is defined as     satisfaction of one or more subsets.        What criteria should the WG use to establish subsets?     How many should there be? Note that if the WG defines a     finite number of subsets against which conformance      may be measured, this reduces the flexibility of the      document (although it simultaneously makes it more precise).       (See, for example, Al Gilman's proposal to use User     Interface Profiles as a means of establishing subsets     [1].)         [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0344.html       Although the checkpoints are being written     for developers, conformance is likely to be measured in      terms of whether it satisfies a user's needs:      does a product (or products) make the Web      accessible/inaccessible to people with a certain      disability? This has a direct impact on the conformance     system we define. Just as Priorities     reflect the importance of a checkpoint to the user,     conformance should be measured in terms of how well     accessibility is achieved by a product      <em>with respect to the checkpoints in this     document</em>. (Note that conformance to this     document does <em>not</em> simply mean that a UA is      accessible, but that the UA satisfies this document's     definition of conformance.)       Another question: are subsets necessary at all? Will they     be useful? Will they be useful to organizations      attempting to determine conformance?      While creating subsets is one response to the comment     "There are too many Priority 1's to satisfy," it     is not the only possible response and may not be useful      in practice.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      Hello,     Per my action item of 11 May [1], please consider this  clarification to checkpoint 8.4. From the 7 May Working  Draft [2]:    <OLD>  8.4 Make available to the user an "outline" view of content,       built from structural elements (e.g., frames, headings,       lists, forms, tables, etc.).  </OLD>    First some comments:    1) A navigable outline view is very useful (related to 7.6 and 7.7)  2) A non-navigable outline view is still useful, since it can      help users understand the organization of content. Thus,     one important feature of an outline view is that content be     hidden.  3) Is the outline view supposed to be text only? We may     not have to specify this and it should be understood that     if there is non-text content, the user agent needs to     provide a text equivalent.  4) The outline view is probably supposed to be composed     of (text) labels for important structural elements.     In some cases, the content of the elements will not     appear in the outline view.     <NEW>  8.4 Make available to the user an "outline" view of content      composed of labels for important structural      elements (e.g., heading text, table titles,       form titles, etc.).  </NEW>    At the 11 May teleconference, we discussed the link between  checkpoint 7.6 (structured navigation) and 8.4. One possibility  for the minimal requirement of the outline view was that  it be composed of the set of elements navigable according to 7.6.  If checkpoint 7.6 is augmented (refer to proposal [3])  to include dynamic control over the set of navigable elements,   then it makes sense for 8.4 to be dynamic as well. And 8.5   (configuration of the outline view), like 7.7, would just be   about static configuration and could remain a P3.

      Hello,    Philippe Le H?garet and I are discussing what tools we can  make available to W3C editors to make it easier to publish  technical reports. Philippe has recently rewritten the production  scripts for the DOM specification using the DOM (in java). Given  a document that uses the DOM spec DTD [3], the java scripts (which   still require some testing) produce a document that has a good  chance of conforming to the W3C publication rules [1]. (The java  scripts will be available on the public cvs server [2].)    Here's our idea:    1) Provide tools to W3C editors to make publishing easier,     but don't require people to use them to conform to the     publication rules.     2) Make available a standard XML format for W3C specs. To this     end, the DOM and XML WGs should strive to use a common XML     format.    3) Given a document that conforms to the common format, offer     tools (e.g., xslt style sheets or java scripts) that will     generate a TR document. Philippe's scripts offer the following     functionalities:         1) They generate a table of contents and sub-tables          of contents.       2) They generate/manage an index.       3) They manage a list of references and          links to those references from the document.       4) They generate/manage a glossary.       5) They can be used to generate HTML 4. Tidy can be used          to turn these documents into XHTML.       6) For the DOM, they manage interface definitions.     4) Given a valid XHTML document that uses some predefined classes,     offer an xslt style sheet to convert the document to     the common format.    5) Given a valid HTML 4 document, tidy can be used to create a      valid XHTML document.    In short, we would like people to be able to use the tools at  various entry points. We would also like people to be able to   use whatever tools they prefer to create their documents.    Questions:    1) Would people find this suite of tools useful?     2) Would people with expertise in xslt volunteer to help      create the xhtml->xml translation?     3) Do people have specific requirements for the common format?    4) How extensible should the common format be?    Any comments and suggestions are welcome.       - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules  [2] http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/  [3] http://www.w3.org/DOM/Group/drafts/pubtext/spec.dtd    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

However, there are some terms that are   used differently in different contexts or by different  communities, including words like "element", which may have  a technical meaning (e.g., SGML) and common parlance meaning  (component). We need a glossary to ensure that readers understand  what we mean.     Internal consistency is crucial and I hope you will point out  inconsistencies you find.    I am all for the clearest language possible (and to avoid  jargon where we can).  If you can propose other language you feel is  clearer, please don't hesitate.    Just an historical note: "viewport" comes from the CSS2  specification [1]:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  9.1.1 The viewport        User agents for continuous media generally offer       users a viewport (a window or other viewing area on the      screen) through which users consult a document. User       agents may change the document's layout when the      viewport is resized (see the initial containing block).       When the viewport is smaller than the document's initial      containing block, the user agent should offer a scrolling        mechanism. There is at most one viewport per      canvas, but user agents may render to more than one       canvas (i.e., provide different views of the same document).   </BLOCKQUOTE>    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#viewport     - Ian

There were several points raised at the teleconference yesterday  on this topic. The most important, in my opinion, was that the proposed  checkpoint can be generalized and that users should  have final say over scripts. The guidelines already state that users  should   have the final say about styles. This would extend that control to  scripts.    The W3C CSS and FP Working Group is currently working on proposals   (called "Behaviors" and "Action Sheets") that would allow users   (and authors) to associate scripts with elements and event handlers   in a manner very similar to style sheets (using selectors, for example).     I have sent email to the Chair of that Working Group indicating   a possible dependence with WAI on this matter.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I prefer "initiate" since that is a concept that applies more  widely: changes that the user does not initiate may be disorienting.

Agreed. That's why the checkpoint states:    "offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts"    This guarantees that color alone will not be used.

      Hello,    In a frenzy of avoiding other work that I should be doing,  I've made some changes to the Working Group home page.     1) Older deliverables have been moved to a new document [1].     There is a link to that document at the end of the first     section "Deliverables and Related Documents".    2) User Agent evaluations have been moved to a new      document [2]. I project that this document will     become more important once (and if) we start (again)     tracking how user agents conform to the guidelines.    3) Previous meetings have been moved to a new     document [3]. There is a link to that document     at the end of section 2 "Meetings and Conference     Calls".    4) The navbar at the top of the page is shorter and     simpler.     Please let me know whether you find this organization  more helpful.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/Deliverables  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/Evaluations  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/Meetings  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello Working Group,    I've updated the issues list [1] with issues raised during  the Proposed Recommendation review of the Guidelines [2].  Notes on the issues:    1) Seventy issues were raised. While that may be intimidating,     on review I'm convinced that most of them only      require clarifications to the document. While we need to     consider each issue, I think that we can address most of them     very quickly in our meeting.    2) For most of the checkpoints, I have proposed a resolution     (some of them conceived with Charles as well). These proposals     are only meant as starting points for discussion.    3) Issues 253 through 276 were not raised in a formal review      and so, strictly speaking, we are not required to address them     in order to advance. However, I think that we should consider     them as some of them are quite important. We should examine these     after the other issues to ensure that we finish the "official"     list first. (Actually, issues 207 through 211 were also raised     by the WG, not the AC, and we should also consider those.)    I have quoted below all the PR issues. The online version is more  accessible (with links, etc.).       Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    BEGIN LIST OF PR ISSUES 276 through 207 (reverse order).

I would add that an additional benefit is that  this allows aids to monitor and/or intercept the       input. IJ Proposed: Adopt suggested additional text.

The words clearly and correctly state that  functionality and usability are more important than       consistency, but the order and amount of space given to consistency  strongly conveys the opposite message.

Is it  not equally important to allow rearranging textual       controls, such as menu titles and toolbar buttons with textual  labels? CMN: Priority of text controls less important       since designed for users with CD (but a good catch anyway). IJ: I  would have assumed that text labels were       included in this requirement since if they don't follow their  controls, then that would be even more confusion.       Also, I believe this is referring to all controls of a graphical  user interface.

Most media players don't  support moving the captions to arbitrary locations,       and I see lack of this feature as making things difficult but not  impossible.

The       Web Content guidelines use such linkages. For example, it should  not be a Pri 1 requirement that you document       Pri 3 features: the fact that the feature is only Pri 3 means the  user does not really need it, and thus failing to       document it won't make it "impossible" for users to access the Web.  CMN Proposed: The WG intentionally did       not choose a relative priority rating for this and other  checkpoints related to Web content. In this case, knowing       the featureis there is critical to being able to learn to use the  tool.

IJ Proposed: It  is disorienting for users with CD, or who are       blind or accessing information serially. I can see that it doesn't  prevent access to content, however, it may make       it near impossible for some users (e.g., with short-term memory  problems) to locate where they were.

That is because images can be extremely       distracting for users with some cognitive disabilities, who may  need to have them replaced by the text in order to       be make the page useable. (It also seems a bit strange that letting  the user turn off images is Pri 3 but letting       users choose to see the alternative text is Pri 1.) IJ Proposed:  The WG decided that background images were       more distracting than other images. Hence two different  checkpoints. CMN Proposed: This is just a special case       of 2.5 since an image is an alternative to its text equivalent.

Blind users may  need this information but that means making it       available programmatically for use by their screen reader should be  sufficient, and that is already covered in       checkpoint 5.1 ("Provide programmatic read access to HTML"). If the  UA provides its own UI to display this       information directly to the user, that would only benefit blind  users running "older" screen readers that fail to take       advantage of technological innovations such as the DOM and MSAA.  Also, any UI for this it probably won't be       usable with the keyboard unless they allow navigation to non-active  content, and that is not even a Pri 3       recommendation at this point.

In  particular, follow conventions for user       interface design, default keyboard configuration, product  installation, and documentation." I'm all in favor of       consistency when it is appropriate, but I cannot justify this being  a Pri 2 requirement. I would find it acceptable if       the UA provides equivalent functionality through other means,  especially one that is more accessible than the       system standard. For example, if a UA provides an entirely  automated installation using a batch file, or a product       for blind users provides a self-voicing installer, those might be  more accessible than using the system installer       and I would find them an acceptable and even laudable approach. I  am hoping that the authors really meant       ?Follow operating system conventions for accessibility? and did not  mean to include every mainstream       operating system convention. If so I would recommend clarifying the  wording. CMN Proposed: There are       accessibility conventions that amount to the software equivalent of  an alternative page. For example, editing a       batch script to run the installation. I agree with GL's proposal  "Follow operating system conventions for       accessibility" and consider this an editorial clarification.

What is the real goal? I doubt it is that everything,  including text input, needs to be supported using the       alone mouse. Does it also imply that if voice input is supported  for dictation it also needs to be supported for       command-and-control? Or is the real intent just "make sure every  active element can be navigated to and       manipulated using the keyboard," which is mostly redundant to other  checkpoints. Proposed CMN: Implies that       active elements, command and control, etc can be done through  keyboard, voice (using an appropriate API),       etc. A particular failing of most user agents here is to buy the  HTML mouse-specific event model for creating       active elements and not allow that to be done except with a mouse.

It sounds like the user       needs to be able to input text through the mouse API, and that any  UA that supports voice input for dictation or       for command-and-control is required to support voice input for  both. IJ PRoposed: Editorial clarification       required. The note in 1.1 was supposed to indicate that the user  agent was not required to provide for text input       through the mouse.

[That seems to       be a blanket exemption for a user agent that may use the operating  system's own features to accomplish a task       instead of implementing natively.] IJ Proposed: Yes, this is the  intention. However the UA must ensure that OS       features used are accessible. No change is required since this is  stated in the applicability section.

This should be clarified by stating that in  all cases the information should be exposed to       the user directly through the UI except where the wording  explicitly says that the information may be exposed       programmatically.

I assume you are talking about mnemonics. With them the underlining  only occurs within the menu or in the area       you are directly interacting with (e.g. a dialog box) and they must  be explicitly set by the developer.

I recommend rewording of the example.

[Guideline 7] adds to my confusion. AT of the type highlighted in  this document does not act by itself in       "displaying" web content but instead, as noted in the doc, works  with other UAs. AT can and do for product       distinguisher reasons provide some of their own navigating  mechanisms, as screen readers and magnifiers do,       but they don't provide all that the user needs (they only do some  of what is highlighted in this guideline). Instead       they mostly tap into and take advantage of functionality provided  by the platform's UI toolkit and custom       components used in the UA the AT is interacting with. By placing AT  in the UA category in this document, does       that mean the AT and UA developers should both be supplying the  same navigation methods? If no, where       should the line be drawn and what checkpoints need to be added to  make that clear for developers? I ask       because while it may be appropriate for something like the HPR to  be put under the scrutiny of these guidelines,       ATs of the type highlighted in these guidelines shouldn't have to  be - they're interacting with the information and       functionality that came to the UA they are paired with. I agree in  the broader sense that an AT is a user agent       but for this document I don't think they should be clumped  together. Or AT, for this document, should be defined       as HPR, Opera, or some other technology that is specifically  focused on web content. IJ Proposed: We may       need to make clearer that this document's requirements are not  intended for "dependent" UAs (though they       could try to conform if they wished) To do this: - Clarify how UAs  in general and ATs are meant to interact. -       Refer to dfn of UA in UA responsibilities.  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/03/ua-resp-20000308        Key References: none         Issue 231 (Proposed Recommendation): Guideline 6: In Guideline  rationale, identify scope of W3C and non-W3C  reqs        Name: AC Review        Source URL: AC Review        Date: Sun Apr 9 08:52:29 2000        Category of issue: Editorial        Type of issue: none specified        Resolution summary: Not resolved        Resolution URL: Not resolved        First working draft: No reference        Comments:       I started down a comment path thinking this guideline was meant to  cover W3C -and- non-W3C specs (e.g.       Java and Java Accessibility).

If this whole guideline is meant to cover all       specs for technology that might be used in the content of a web  page then perhaps a specific set of statements       should be made in the opening guideline description or a guideline  added that says something like "If you don't       use a W3C technology/spec then make sure it can support accessible  design."

I suggest this       because putting this information in a central location, as an  accessibility API does, makes it easy for the       assistive technology vendor to find and support access to this in  their product. It also generally means that the       way the notification is exposed won't change between dot releases  of the UA or platform it runs on (i.e. the       accessibility API won't change) IJ Proposed: This is covered by  checkpoint 5.5. Propose to add a note to       guideline 5 that explains (as is done in 1.1) that these  checkpoints apply to each other, and to any API       described in the document.

It might be good to change "user  interface" to "chrome" (with an accompanying       definition defining what chrome means - it's everything that  doesn't display page author generated content)       unless "user interface" truly does also include "content" related  checkpoints. If the later is the case, perhaps a       third section name should be added called "mixed" or something  which is meant to denote that the checkpoints       apply to both the "content" portion and "chrome." The "content  accessibility" title isn't quite right either. It reads       like something more appropriate in the Web Content Accessibility  Guidelines. Since this really, I believe, applies       to the content parser how about changing "content accessibility" to  "content parser accessibility" or "content       view generator accessibility" or something? IJ Proposed: - This is  part of review of definition of "content" (raised       as part of issue 207) - Editorial clarification required, notably  for G5.

For this  checkpoint it doesn't say that when one multimedia       channel slows (e.g. the visual track of video) the other channel  should slow at the same rate. Should it say all       channels need to stay synchronized? Should the user be able to slow  or speed one track while letting others       stay at normal rates? It's not clear.

For example say, "for multiline ASCII art, <what to do>."    Yesterday's minutes [1] talk about breaking the ascii   art checkpoint (1.6 in [2]):        Replace ASCII art with an image or describe the       ASCII art and provide a means (e.g., a link) to skip over it.     Into three checkpoints, stated briefly as:    a) Use images instead of ascii art.       (Use proper markup)  b) Provide text equivalents of ascii art. (Equivalent information)  c) Provide links over ascii art.          (Navigation)    Although breaking down the current checkpoint this way makes  sense to me, it seems to imply that any time you use ascii art,  you are not satisfying (a). That's probably why there is  currently only one checkpoint with an "or" in it.     Unless someone wants to propose a different formulation  of checkpoint 1.6, I will leave it as is.     Al, do you think the existing text of 1.6 should be  changed/made more precise?     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0486.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990316                  > Smileys and multiline ASCII art share the following characteristics:  >   > a) is constructed on the fly out of the same characters concurrently used  > to convey natural language which has a sonic equivalent.  >   > b) has no phonetic interpretation.  >   > In other words, it  >   > a) occurs in a context where text-to-speech processing may assume it is  > articulable as speech, and  >   > b) is not appropriate for text-to-speech transformation by the standard  > relationships of the enclosing natural language.  >   > If we "define ASCII art" to exclude smileys, I fear we will have numerous  > readers who fail to retain and apply the local definition.

Ian reviews conformance proposal.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0365.html       KB: Is it basically all or nothing for communication?       CMN: If you don't work with other software, then you're not          interoperable.       RS: Are there degrees of interoperability?       JB: Yes, there are different priorities for those checkpoints.       MN: I think this is the wrong direction since it weakens         conformance. I'm not comfortable with this direction. Why         would you offer conformance for UAs that don't meet         published software accessibility standards. I could say         I'm interoperable and not support some standard API.       IJ: You could not support the mouse and still be interoperable.         But if you support the mouse, you need to do so accessibly.      CMN: My concern: HPR is not an accessible user agent, per se.          It's a good tool for a certain set of user, just like NN         is useful for a set of users. I don't want the         result of this conformance provision to be useful tools         that are not interoperable. I think we would still lose.         Analogous to question in AUGL WG about accessibility of         AU Tools. I think this proposal is a step forward.         I want to emphasize that a stand-alone UA is not sufficient         to solve the problem of ensuring an accessible Web.       KB: I like removing the distinction between desktop and dependent         UA. Like Ian, I'm concerned about removing the complete         requirement of interoperability.       JG: The checkpoints in Guideline 6 (on communication) refer to         standards and conventions (except for DOM) that are not         W3C Recommendations.        MN: I don't understand "interoperability". I don't want a tool         to be able to confirm if it doesn't conform to published         guidelines for software accessibility.       JG: I like in this proposal that it is forward-looking for         new technologies (e.g., voice input/output).        AG: This is related to mobile platforms - it makes sense for         desktop computers to have extensibility requirements. But         not as much for a mobile device. It's not so much that the         tool interacts with the Web. But is it running in a context         where extension is a natural requirement.       MK: If you're afraid people won't conform, you can do something         at the icon level.       IJ: But we would still need to agree on the split.       No consensus. Please review and comment on the list. This will be    on the agenda again next week.    3) Issue #90: UA and AU dependency list (KB and JA proposals)     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#90        CMN: Those comments are more about when AU will review UA in          last call rather than vice-versa. But is there something          we need to do to the UA guidelines to meet requirements          of UAGL.        AG: E.g., UAGL wants to do hierarchical navigation. An          extremely useful thing for AU tools to do is to display          the hierarchical structure. This would expose the          author to the concepts of hierarchical blocks. (e.g.,          in a related power toy).            MR: The second half of Kitch's message goes in that direction.       CMN: Yes. The Authoring Tool GL approach is to refer to other          documents rather than repeating that information. We're          not going to include WCAG techniques, for example, since          implementors must know those guidelines anyway. We've also          tried to be general enough to not refer only to HTML          or a particular image format or tool. Most popular tools          used by professionals are really text editors without          a WYSIWYG interface that give access to the source (e.g.,          DreamWeaver, etc.)                In short, there's a big dependency on the UAGL. But the          current approach is not to include specific checkpoints          that match up exactly with checkpoints in other guidelines.            The AUGL would love more review. But the UAGL review has          already been good.        JG: All my comments were sent to AU archives.        IJ: Kitch, Jon, Jim, Ian have all commented. Perhaps all we          need to make available to AUGL at some point is a statement          from the Chair stating that the AUGL WG has responded to          our comments.        JG: Can UAGL review again during Proposed Recommendation?       CMN: It's not exactly clear what a WG does when it's not           happy with the results of the last call. But the WG          will track last call comments and show resolutions.        AG: And Ian should track those for the UA Group.      Resolved: This issue is considered closed. However, the               AUGL last call continues and comments are still              welcome.                (Rich and Mark leave).     4) Issue #78 Review requirements for window spawning     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#78       AG: Generic three levels of control:       a) Lightest: When you spawn, alert the user. No control       b) Middle: If you spawn, you ask the user to confirm.       c) Most severe: Spawning inhibited.       Ian had proposed (a) only in [1]     [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0212.html          AG: People need to be able to follow the evolution. Need to be able         to return to known context with back button. Spawning breaks         this since you can't undo the window creation. Eyes-free users         need to understand the information space. The difference         between Ian's proposal and what I proposed [2] is no more than  P3.         The user should be able to invoke a mode that requires         confirmation.       [2]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0214.html       JG: If I were Chuck Oppermann, I would say that this problem is not         one of user agents, but an operating system convention         issue. Why is problem unique to browsers?       AG: When it happens in the context of browsing, this is a violation         of the contract with the user w.r.t. the Web content. Thus,         even if implemented in the operating system, this is a UA         requirement.        GR: I recently proposed a checkpoint for forms. See Ian's          rewritten proposal [3]. Would it be helpful to write         something similar for spawned windows?       [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0395.html       MK: What about history list of spawned windows?       AG: You lose old history list thread.      CMN: H?kon Lie proposed importing history into spawned windows. If         you do this, do you respect the contract that Al refers to?         My instinct is that you probably have.       AG: You've improved usability, in my opinion, without invoking         the additional levels of control.      CMN: With Amaya, if you have a page that hasn't been saved, it         opens the page in a new window. At the end of the day, I have         a huge pile of excess windows. I throw them all away.       KB: I've seen situations where users end up with two UAs         unknowingly, going to a text editor, then returning and          being lost. (Window opened either by page or UA new window         functionality.)       Action GR: Write a proposal to address issues about spawned windows.    5) Issue #80 Make audio available as text.     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#80      MR: In rationale of Guideline 1, I thought an additional example        on output device independence. Example would meet needs of        deaf users and output device independence. Take text from        [3]:         "And any output provided in audio should also be available in        text since most alternative output mechanisms rely on the presence        of system-drawn text on the screen."      AG: Also add cross-reference to show sounds in techniques document.      Resolved: ok.      [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0083.html      6) Issue #81 Turn on/off audio descs.     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#81       MR: Propose adding a one for auditory descriptions.       IJ: Could combine as "auditory description" as we did below.       AG: Might be better to keep separate for clarity.       MR: Propose "alternative equivalent" track in place of         "descriptive track".        MK: "Continuous equivalent".       MR: So bring language more in line with SMIL accessibility Note.       Resolved:        a) Generalize 4.5 to continuous equivalents. (list each expected         type).      b) Apply this language to related checkpoints.       Action Ian: Make these editorial changes about continuous equivs.         MR: Note that SMIL 1.0 only allows people to turn off captions.         Should have in SMIL 2.0 means to turn off auditory descs.       IJ: I agree that design ideas about the future are good for         the techniques.       AG: In PF, we may not be seeing enough of this conversation.         The PF charter requires us to send requirements to the         SYMM Group.      CMN: Some of that's in my court.       Action MR: Working on SMIL techniques in addition to SMIL access                note. Also, coordinate with Geoff Freed so that                issue sufficiently addressed in PF.    7) Issue #82 Rendering image in a link when there's no alt.     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#82       When images are turned off, how do you indicate the link?       AG: The "altifier" tool does this. E.g., for a link to the         same place on the same page, it steals the link text.       Resolved (pending comments from Harvey): Add info to techniques         document about this.              Action Ian: Link to "altifier" from Techniques document.                 http://www.vorburger.ch/projects/alt/                                 Link to ER tools page from techniques.                 http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html    8) Issue #83 Split speech rendering checkpoints since               different priorities.     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#83       From Jim Thatcher:          Speech volume/rate are priority 2 or 1, pitch and           gender are priority 3 (max), in my opinion.       JG: Proposal to create several checkpoints.        MR: I agree with Rate/Volume Priority 1, Pitch/Gender Priority 3.       GR: Sounds reasonable       AG: Let's ask Kitch to investigate the pitch issue. May be P2         for a small number of people.       JG: Some people with head injuries are sensitive to          gender/pitch.          GR: I'd support P2 for Pitch/Gender       MR: If you're implementing synthetic speech anyway, these aren't         much more.       Resolved:       a) Volume is P1       b) Others P2.     9) Issue #84 Checkpoint on natural language applies to all UAs.     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#84        KB, IJ: Should apply to all user agents.       AG: One argument is that supporting it in the visual environment         is just supporting HTML 4.0. The severity of the accessibility         issue goes up in the auditory scenario. It applies in all         cases, however, just in terms of conformance to the HTML spec.       KB: Is there some reason a mainstream UA would not want to do this?        IJ: I delete email that arrives in the wrong character encoding.      CMN: I don't, I go to a different tool.      Resolved: Natural language checkpoint applies to all user agents.            13:33 ET Adjourned

It seems that we are missing minimal requirements for speech  > rendering for 8.2, 8.3, 4.15 and 4.16.    Here's my new reasoning: the selection (or focus) need not only be for  text. For instance, a selected image may have a border around it.  Similarly,  links may have text or non-text content. So for all four checkpoints,  the  content type doesn't matter.    I agree that we don't have minimal speech requirements for the four  checkpoints in question. However, as we resolved in a previous  teleconference,  I think that we should not refine our speech requirements any further  for  this document since there are other W3C WGs working on voice/speech  issues.     _ Ian     > Jon  >   > At 07:27 PM 10/11/2000 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >jon gunderson wrote:  > > >  > > > Section 3.4 Content type labels  > > >  > > > 1.

      Hello,    As part of resolving issues 255 [1] and 260 [2], I would like to   propose the following changes to Guideline 1.    Proposal 1) For the Guideline rationale:    <OLD>  In addition to ensuring device-independent access to all  functionalities,  developers must use the standard APIs of the operating system for  supported  devices. This allows assistive technologies to operate the user agent  programmatically by simulating events from a mouse, keyboard, pen, or  other  input device. For instance, when standard APIs are used, some users who  are  not able to enter text easily through a standard physical keyboard may  still use  voice input or an on-screen keyboard to operate the user agent.   </OLD>    <NEW>  To ensure that assistive technologies can both operate the user agent  programmatically (e.g., through simulated keyboard events) and monitor  user  agent output (e.g., output text), developers are expected to use each  API  appropriately. For example, for rendering text, developers are expected  to use  an API for drawing text. Developers should not, for example, convert  text to a  bitmap to be rendered via a graphical API; this may prevent other  software from  being able to use the text.   </NEW>    Proposal 2) Checkpoint 1.1      <OLD>  1.1 Ensure that every functionality available through the user      interface is also available through every input device API supported      by the user agent. Excluded from this requirement are  functionalities      that are part of the input device API itself (e.g., text input for  the      keyboard API, pointer motion for the pointer API, etc.) [Priority 1]                Note. The device-independence required by this checkpoint                   applies to functionalities described by the other  checkpoints                   in this document (e.g., installation, documentation,  user agent                   user interface configuration, etc.). This checkpoint  does not                   require user agents to use all operating system input  device                   APIs, only to make the software accessible through  those                   they do use.   </OLD>    <NEW>  1.1 Ensure that every functionality available through the user interface      is available through every input API implemented by the user agent.      [Priority 1]               Note. This checkpoint does not require developers to                  implement all operating system input APIs, only to make  the                  software accessible through those they do implement. The                  device-independence required by this checkpoint applies  to                  the functionalities described by the other checkpoints  in this                  document (e.g., installation, documentation, user agent  user                  interface configuration, etc.). This checkpoint does not  require                  developers to reimplement the input methods associated  with                  the keyboard, pointing device, voice, and other device  APIs.                   For example, developers are not required to implement  text                  input through a mouse API.  </NEW>    Proposal 3) Checkpoint 1.2    Add the following note after the existing text:    <NEW>   Note. Developers should use APIs available at a higher level of         abstraction than device APIs, provided that, in turn, these         higher level APIs make use of the standard device APIs for         the operating system.   </NEW>    Proposal 4) Checkpoint 1.4    <OLD>  1.4 Ensure that every functionality available through the user      interface is also available through the standard keyboard API.      [Priority 1]           Note. This checkpoint is an important special case of                checkpoint 1.1. The comment about low-level  functionalities                in checkpoint 1.1 applies to this checkpoint as well.  Refer                also to checkpoint 10.8.   </OLD>    <NEW>  1.4 Implement the standard keyboard API of the operating system and      ensure that every functionality available through the user interface  is      available through this API. [Priority 1]           Note. This checkpoint always applies on systems with a                standard keyboard API. This checkpoint is an important                special case of checkpoint 1.1.

This     would make the either the Guideline too specific (since it     mentions W3C) or the checkpoint too general (and it should be     limited to W3C specs).     2) 11.1 refers to support for accessibility features, 11.2 refers to     support for standards. If you can't do all of a standard (Priority 2)     then be sure to do the accessibility parts (Priority 1).    There's an emphasis on W3C specs for reasons enumerated  in the rationale paragraph:        > * W3C technologies include "built-in" accessibility features.      > * W3C specifications undergo early review to ensure that          accessibility issues are considered during the design phase.      > * W3C specifications are developed in an open, industry          consensus process.     To address the discrepancy between the guideline text and  the text of checkpoint 11.1, we could either:    a) Expand the scope of the guideline to something like      "Support Open Specifications and Known Accessibility Features"         We might add a checkpoint to the effect of "Support open standards",     but I'm not convinced of the necessity.    b) Reduce the scope of checkpoint 11.1 to be: "Implement     accessibility features defined for supported W3C technologies."    I propose (a) without an additional checkpoint.    On a related note:    Yesterday in the AU WG meeting [1] we debated the use of the  word "defined" in a similar checkpoint from the AU Guidelines.  Several people felt that "defined" was too strong a word.    The 18 August version of the AU Guidelines [2] reads:      > 3.1 Implement all accessible authoring practices     >     that have been defined for the markup    >     language(s) supported by the tool. [Priority 1]       The 25 August version of the AU Guidelines [3] reads:       > 3.1 Ensure the author can implement accessible    >     authoring practices for the markup   >     language(s) supported by the tool.    I propose that in any wording change to checkpoint 11.1  of the UA Guidelines, that we adopt similar wording, along  the lines of:       "Implement known accessibility features of W3C technologies."    or in the more general case:         "Implement known accessibility features of supported       technologies."    (Perhaps adding a note that this means markup languages, style   sheet languages, schema languages, metadata formats, etc.)    Thanks Kitch,     - Ian    Reference document:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990809/    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0142.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990818/  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990825  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

Report on implementation progress and             assessment of need for subsequent work in this area."    There may be other ways to satisfy this deliverable than a list  of conforming tools, but such a list does not seem to be beyond  the scope of the charter.    An important question may be raised: Is W3C the definitive authority  for validating conformance claims? This question is pertinent even  without publication of a list of conforming tools on the site.  Publication of conformance claims at the W3C will surely contribute  to the perception that W3C has the authoritative word (and maybe  even exclusively).     I think this question merits discussion in the WAI CG since at  least the UAGL should operate similarly. I suggest that:    1) Any list of conforming tools indicate that this is not the     definitive list of conforming tools nor an advertisement     for particular tools. It's just a convenient repository.    2) Any entry on the list clearly indicate whether W3C has     "validated" the claim or not. Whether W3C chooses to validate     claims at all is another matter for the CG.     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter3#deliverables  $Date: 1999/11/18 08:35:54 $     > and would appreciate hearing from anyone  > in the business -- as well as anyone who has used the tools and who has read,  > or would care to read, ATAG and the Techs document...  >   > that way, eventually, we may well someday have enough data to compile the  > database driven tool descriptor about which charles is wont to wax rhetorical  > -- a form driven, show me the tools engine, where the user gets to choose the  > criteria...  >   > gregory.  >   > Bill wrote:  > >CMcCN:: "...the working group has a page which describes the conformance  > >of various tools at XXX."  > >  > >WL: If we're going to "name names" I feel we are treading treacherous  > >slippery slope.

      Hello,    Today, Jon and I discussed issue 287 (about audio volume   checkpoints) [1] (refer to resolution to keep one checkpoint  about global control and one about independent control of  audio sources [2]). Jon made the following comments:    1) Independent control of audio volume is more important     for synchronized presentations than for non-synchronized     content. When content is not intended to be synchronized,     users don't need to worry about competing volumes as long     as they can play the sources independently. Global volume     control suffices when you can play different audio sources     independently. This is covered by the checkpoint to     start, pause, resume, etc. audio.    2) Speech synthesizer volume is generally handled globally     for applications, not on an application-by-application     basis.    3) "Too much control" (namely, the ability to change the      volume of independent audio sources played simultaneously)         may require such complex interaction as not to promote     accessibility in practice. Are we requiring midi user agents     to provide an interface to control the volume of each track?     An equalizer tool (fairly comment to control relative volumes)     does not typically work on individual components but on     frequencies. Would that meet the requirements of this checkpoint     nonetheless?    4) This is a fairly serious change of scope from the     previous checkpoints about volume.    5) This discussion suggests a content issue: should the WCAG     be recommending that authors provide content in recognizable     tracks (e.g., a SMIL presentation) as opposed to formats     without tracks (e.g., a WAV file)?    Based on these comments, I'd like to propose that we reconsider  the resolution. I have the following wording for the proposed  checkpoint (proposed, but in no document yet):          "Allow the user to control independently the volumes of      audio sources recognized as distinct."    I propose we create two checkpoints instead to emphasize  the critical cases and to reduce the scope of the  change:    <NEW 1>     "Allow the user to control independently the volumes      of audio sources synchronized to play simultaneously.  </NEW 1>    <NEW 2>     "Allow the user to control the synthesized speech volume      independently of other sources of audio."         Note: It is expected that speech synthesizer volume will               be set at the system level.  </NEW 2>    Notes:     - The second checkpoint is much closer in scope to the     previous version of the speech volume checkpoint. For     example, from the Candidate Recommendation:         "Allow the user to configure synthesized speech volume."       However, the new version talks about control and not     just configuration.      - As usual, if the UA cannot determine that two sources of     audio should be played simultaneously, the first      checkpoint does not apply.    Comments welcome,     - Ian         [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#287  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0506.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    As part of resolving issue 235 [1], I'd like to propose  the following note after checkpoint 8.1 and the following  addition to the techniques document.    Checkpoint and note:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose of each  table and the relationships among the table cells and headers.    For example, provide information about table headers,   how headers relate to cells, table summary   information, cell position information, table dimensions, etc.  Graphical user agents may satisfy this checkpoint by   rendering a table as a two dimensional grid and ensuring that  users can find headers associated with cells.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    Technique:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  In HTML, beyond the TR, TH, and TD elements, the table attributes  "summary", "abbr", "headers", "scope", and "axis" provide information  about relationships among cells and headers.  For   more information, refer to the section on table techniques.  </BLOCKQUOTE>     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/rfbd-20000410#issue-235  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

How about the following relative expression of the checkpoint:      Provide a version of the product documentation that     conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines     1.0 [WCAG10]. [Priority 1 for Level A conformance, Priority 2    for Level Double-A conformance, Priority 3 for Level Triple-A    conformance.]    1) This isn't too long or complicated.  2) The implication is that if you want to be a level Double-A     conforming UA, your documentation has to conform to WCAG 1.0     level A. If you want to be a Triple-AAA UA, your documentation     has to be Triple-AAA WCAG.       I think that the real implication there is that there will     never be any Triple-AAA user agents...    3) The best documentation is no documentation (i.e., the     user interface is so good you don't need any)!     - Ian      > Jon  >   > At 12:23 AM 8/18/2000 -0400, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  > >Well, I would vote for a relative priority as used in ATAG.

      Hello,    We've just completed publication of the latest  public working draft of the WAI User Agent Guidelines [1].    Thanks to the Working Group for your comments and   suggestions, which I hope we have represented fairly in this draft  (which replaces the 3 July public draft). Comments  that have not been included should appear in the next Working  Group draft. Please let us know if we have overlooked particular  points.    Please review this document and encourage review   by other interested parties.     Thank you,     - The Editors    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-USERAGENT/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I think it is fair to a large extent because this is a "document"  that has a reading order. We should tell them where they *must not*  infer anything based on reading order. For example, the order  of the Guidelines is not significant. The order of the checkpoints  is significant (e.g., we order them thematically and sort by priority).    > It seems to me that our  > approach has been to try to make important contextual information (e.g.,  > qualifiers, caveats, etc.) explicit.

Is such feasible?    It may be, but unless it has some normative status, I don't think  we should do this.

IJ: The links to the techniques from the guidelines document   are absolute links to the *latest version of techniques on the Web*.   They are not relative links to another file in the same directory.  This was designed so that people would always follow links  to the latest and greatest techniques. As a result, there is  no benefit (or need or requirement) to unzipping all the  files in the same directory. They are independent documents  (like CSS and HTML) and are not intended to be unzipped in  the same place.    I think that for me to change names or organization of this  kind at this point I would need to hear very convincing   arguments about why one should be able to put all the files  in the same directory. Please note that they do *not* interlink  relatively, and so nothing is gained in that respect.     (I also think that we should spend our time on more important  issues than this as I am pretty convinced that given how  the documents interlink, there's no benefit to unzipping  in the same place. I may be very wrong, but I'd rather worry  about substantial issues at this point.    > They can share the URL references to common images and style sheets.    There is only one common style sheet (no common images except  the icons at the top of the document, also referenced globally).  I don't mind copying the style sheet for each distribution.      - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783        

      Per my action of the 10 April face-to-face meeting [1], here  is a proposal to clarify checkpoint 9.2 (issue 208). The Working Group  felt that this checkpoint was intended to allow configuration of   prompting (like all the other checkpoints), but the wording did not  capture that. Here is a proposed clarification:    <OLD>  9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly,   that is by any means other than the user activating an explicit form   submit control.  </OLD>    <NEW>  When configured to do so, prompt the user to confirm any form  submission triggered indirectly, that is by any means other than the   user activating an explicit form submit control.  </NEW>     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/rfbd-20000410#issue-208  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Per our action item of the 26 October teleconference [1] related  to issue 321 [0], Eric and I would like to propose the following   change to checkpoint 2.3 (from the 23 October draft [2]).   The change uses the term "alternative" instead of "equivalent"   and we explain why below.    <OLD>  2.3 Provide easy access to each equivalent and each equivalency target  through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing  configuration to render the equivalent instead of the equivalency  target; (2) allowing configuration to render the equivalent in  addition to the equivalency target; (3) allowing the user to select  the equivalency target and then inspect its equivalents; (4) providing  a direct link to the equivalent in content, just before or after the  equivalency target in document order. [Priority 1]    Note: For example, if an image in an HTML document has text equivalents,  provide access to them (1) by replacing the image with the rendered  equivalents, (2) by rendering the equivalents near the image, (3) by  allowing the user to select the image and then inspect its equivalents,  or  (4) by allowing the user to follow readily available links to the  equivalents.   </OLD>    <NEW>  2.3 For any element, provide easy access to each of its alternatives  through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing  configuration to render the alternative instead of the element; (2)  allowing configuration to render the alternative in addition to the  element; (3) allowing the user to select the element and then inspect  its alternatives; (4) providing a direct link to the alternative in  content, just before or after the element in document order.   [Priority 1]   Note: For example, if an image element in an HTML document has an  alternative in the form of a text equivalent, provide access to   the text equivalent through at least one of the following  mechanisms (1) by replacing the image with the rendered text   equivalent, (2) by rendering the text equivalent near the rendered  image,   (3) by allowing the user to select the image and then inspect the  text equivalent, or (4) by allowing the user to follow a link   just after the text equivalent.     Definition of "Alternative relationship, alternative" :      In the context of this document, an alternative relationship between  two    pieces of content means that one piece is intended by the author to  serve    nessentially the same function as the other. For requirements in this    document related to alternative relationships,     the user agent is only responsible for those it can recognize    (generally through markup). In the absence of markup that indicates     otherwise, an equivalency relationship recognized by the user agent     is presumed to indicate the author's intent to present alternatives     (i.e., the equivalent and the equivalency target).    </NEW>    Note: The term "alternative" appears in our document in a few places  (not  many, in fact) and these would need review to ensure consistency. At  first  glance, they don't seem to problematic.    ======  Comment  ======    Summary: Why use "alternative" instead of "equivalent"? In our   document, the definition of "equivalent" has accessibility   implications built-in. The term "alternative" describes the author's   intention in creating a relationship between two pieces of content.  Those pieces of content may have the additional relationship  of "equivalency" when they satisfy the definition of "equivalency"   and one has the potential for providing information to a user with   a disability.    The definition of equivalent begins:       In the context of this document, an equivalency      relationship between two pieces of content means     that one piece -- the "equivalent" -- is able to serve      essentially the same function for a person with a      disability (at least insofar as is feasible, given the      nature of the disability and the state of technology)      as the other piece -- the "equivalency target" --      does for a person without any disability.    Let's call the equivalent "A" and the equivalency target "B".  When  someone using this document says that "A" is equivalent to "B", they are  making an assertion that content "A" is capable (with the various  caveats and  assumptions stated in the definitions) of providing the same  functionality  to a person with a disability as content "B" can provide to a person  without a  disability. Please refer to the definitions of "equivalent" and "text   equivalent" for more detail.     A very specific but important kind of equivalent is the text equivalent.     It is very important to note the following:    1. Even a valid assertion that something is an equivalent does not  necessarily mean that it is accessible. For example, the text may be too  complex (even in is simplest expression) for someone to understand.  Or, the person may not have a braille reader to read it.  Similarly, a valid assertion that something is an  equivalency target does not mean that the target is "inaccessible"  (though  WCAG 1.0 specifically _requires_ a text equivalent for each element   that is presumed to be "inaccessible" due to being a non-text element).    2. The definition of equivalency allows authors to identify  equivalency relationships that are not required by specifications.   For example, even though no W3C specification requires an  English language translation of French language document, one could  potentially specify a text equivalence relationship between two  documents,  one of which is a language translation of the other, if the two meet the  definition of text equivalency. (This is related to the last sentence of  item 1, above).     3. The definition of equivalency in our document does not imply or  require   that either piece of content (equivalent or equivalency target) is   <em>intended</em> by the author for audiences of a certain disability  status.  For example, the equivalency relationship does not denote that the  author <em>intended</em> the equivalent to be for a user with a  disability.   Acknowledging the risks of using terms with "loose" definitions,   we would say that the definition of equivalency does not assume   that the equivalency target is the "primary content" (i.e., for   general audiences (?)) or that the equivalent "alternative content"   (i.e., for specific disability audiences (?)).    4. The general definition of "equivalent" does not go so far as to say  which  users with which disabilities may find the equivalent accessible.  However,   the definition of text equivalent, a specific and important kind of  equivalent,   makes that concrete. When an author provides a text equivalent for an  image,   he or she is asserting that text equivalent (content "A") is able to  serve   essentially the same function for a persons in three classes of  disability   with threespecific sets of media presentation technologies  (visually-displayed  text for individuals who are deaf, synthesized speech for people who are  blind,  and braille for individuals who are deaf-blind) -- "at least insofar as  is  feasible, given the nature of the disability and the state of  technology" --  as the image (content "B") does for a person without any  disability.  Quite  a mouthful, but that is the assertion. (See definition of "text  equivalent"  for additional assumptions.)    5. The definition of equivalency does not assume that the equivalency  target  is more "complete" than the equivalent in conveying its message. For  example, a picture is not necessarily more "complete" or adequate than  its  text equivalent.    6. This document requires that all users have access to all content.  This  document does not say that users with disabilities only need access to  the  equivalent.    ======  ISSUE   ======    Enlarging the scope of 2.3 from equivalency relationships  to alternatives in general may have implications on what is  being asked of the user agent. For example, a document in   French may be an alternative to an English version. In HTML,  one can write:         <a lang="fr" rel="alternate" ...>    which means that a user agent can identify the target of   the link as an alternative in French (at least, can recognize  the author's intent, even if what the user agent retrieves  may not be a document in French). Does expanding the scope  of checkpoint 2.3 mean that the user agent must make available  alternatives in other languages? Or should UAAG 1.0 be  limited (beyond providing access to all content), to making  requirements related to alternatives that have an  impact on accessibility?

The checkpoint numbers seem to line up with the 9 March draft:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/    > - does checkpoint 2.10, "Allow configuration not to render...."  > possibly fit better under Guideline 3, "Allow configuration not  > to render...." rather than under Guideline 2, "Ensure  > user....".?    [Editorial]     IJ: Yes, it could go there. I have no strong feelings one way or  the other.    > - would a "note" under checkpoint 3.7 help to clarify why  > "images" are a P2, and not included in checkpoint 3.2 with audio,  > video, and animated images as P1 ?    [Editorial]    IJ: Sure. The rationale is that moving visual informaion is  expected to be more distracting than static visual  information. An excess of visual information may causes problems  to some users with cognitive disabilities.    If people have additional rationale they would like included,  please reply.     > - i'm stuggling with having a concept as important as a  > Guideline, yet that concept doesn't have enough importance  > to have at least one priority 1 checkpoint (e.g., Guideline 5)    [Emotional] <grin>    IJ: I personally have no problem with the concept. <smile> We  created Guideline 5 as the result of a decision at the March  face-to-face meeting [1]. We moved the UI behavior checkpoints  there and, as it turns out, none of them are P1.  But since  Guidelines are almost exclusively there for the purposes of  organization, it doesn't bother me that there are no P1  checkpoints there.    In fact, it is actually a fair representation of the document  that user interface accessibility takes a slight back seat to  content accessibility. In particular, we made an explicit  decision at a teleconference (I don't have the URL handy) to not  make the same requirements for the chrome as we do for  content. Instead, we rely on system software guidelines  (checkpoint 7.3, P2) to cover issues like blinking in the user  interface.

[Editorial]    IJ: I think the word "interoperable" can be deleted.     > - in checkpoint 6.2, which "user interface" is being referred to  > as allowing the user to modify content.  Is it the user agent user  > interface, or is it a user interface built within or from the  > content.  Is this distinction necessary and/or helpful?    [Editorial]    IJ: The distinction is necessary and useful, which is why we have  an entry in the glossary for "user agent user interface", which  is used in checkpoints 1.3, 6.4, and 11.7.    However, in the case of 6.2, the term "user interface" is  intended: it doesn't matter which part of the user interface is  used to modify the content. The term "user interface" links to  the glossary and explains that it includes both user agent user  interface controls AND controls in content.     > - checkpoint 6.6, "Implement standard accessibility APIs.

[Issue]    IJ: "Accessibility APIs" are meant to include MSAA, the Java  Accessibility API, and any other API designed explicitly for the  purpose of improving accessibility. Does that make it clearer?

[Editorial]    IJ: They were intentionally split (fairly recently). Guideline 7  is about operating environment conventions, Guideline 8 about  conformance to specifications. People found it clearer to have  the split.     > - in checkpoint 9.2, it talks about sequential navigation in  > document order.  Is this a problem ?  Rendered order may not  > match document order, and/or are there any international  > layout concerns here?    IJ: What does rendered order mean in the general case (especially  in the CSS2 world of arbitrary positioning)? Visual rendering  based navigation may be very useful, but as a minimal  requirement, we cannot rely on that being well-defined (or  useful) in the general case.    It is true that we don't define "document order" in UAAG 1.0.  It  is my understanding that "document order" means "based on the DOM  tree". I don't know that a particular traversal is implied or  that we need to restrict implementation or a particular traversal  (e.g., preorder).    About interntionalization: I believe I asked Martin D?rst that  question, and I believe he indicated that there were not,  although I don't have any record of that discussion. However, I  believe that relying on the structure (and not the layout)  relieves us of some rendering issues: however the DOM tree is  constructed, the tree order is what is covered by 9.2, not  whether the content is rendered right-to-left or top-to-bottom,  etc.     > - in checkpoint 9.3, you allow the user to activate any explicitly  > associated input device events handlers as a P1, yet in checkpoint  > 9.5, you allow the user to query for a list of input device  > handlers as P2.

      Hello,    (I thought I had sent these comments to the list and/or added this   to the issues list but I must be dreaming since I find evidence   of neither.)    In discussions with the Microsoft IE Team about the User Agent  Guidelines, they expressed concern that two checkpoints  in the last call draft numbered 7.3 and 8.2 were too vague  to be useful:    7.3 Allow the user to navigate just among cells of a table      (notably left and right within a row and up and down       within a column). [Priority 1]     8.2 Convey the author-specified purpose of each table      and the relationships among the table cells and      headers. [Priority 1]     Recall that these checkpoints were initially for  assistive technologies. When we changed conformance strategy,  we chose to generalize the checkpoints that became these  two.    History:     - Changes to 7.3 and 8.2 proposed by Ian [2].   - Working Group resolves to adopt changes 6 October [3].    I will add a proposal to delete these (or move to  assistive technology section in Techniques Doc) to the issues  list.    Regards,      - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0365.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0071.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I suggest that we add to the Techniques document some informative  profiles to give developers a better sense of which checkpoints  apply to some W3C formats.     DISCLAIMER: I came up with the following sample profiles very  quickly, but I wanted to send this idea to the Working Group for  comment.  They should not be construed as the definitive word on  what an HTML browser would have to do to satisfy UAAG 1.0. They  are only offered as examples.    There are 48 P1 requirements in the 9 April 2001 draft [1].    I think that for an HTML browser that is not conforming for  audio, video, and speech, the following 34 checkpoints would  apply:     --   1.1, 1.2, 1.3   2.1, 2.2, 2.3   3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5   4.1, 4.2, 4.3   6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8   7.1, 7.2   8.1   9.1, 9.2, 9.3   10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.7   11.1   12.1, 12.2, 12.3   --    For a SMIL 2.0 player, the following 39 checkpoints  would apply:     --   1.1, 1.2, 1.3   2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6   3.2, 3.3   4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11   6.1, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8   7.1, 7.2   8.1   9.1, 9.2, 9.3   10.2, 10.3, 10.7   11.1   12.1, 12.2, 12.3   --    Here are some reasons for excluding some of the  checkpoints for the SMIL player:     - 3.1: No notion of "background image"?   - 3.4: No scripts? (even though DTD has script.datatype).   - 3.5: No refreshes.   - 6.2: User not able to modify DOM through the UI (e.g., no forms)?   - 10.1: No tables.    I note that there are 29 checkpoints common to both profiles.    There are a number of ways of augmenting the supporting materials  for UAAG 1.0 that would convey the document's intention to  developers:     1) Include this type of profile information (which is essentially      another view of the existing techniques, from the point of      view of a given format).     2) Include test cases for each format. I credit Rob Lanphier       of RealNetworks with the suggestion that we should help      organize test suites for some formats. I think that's a great      idea. It's not a chartered deliverable and therefore I don't      believe that we are obligated to produce test suites for      HTML, SMIL, SVG, etc. Nonetheless, providing some foundation      for the creation of test suites, and proving some example      test cases would be very useful. For instance, we could      make available a number of very short HTML files for each      element and attribute that creates conditional content in       HTML 4.0. Then, it would be possible to test whether one's HTML      browser showed the conditional content per checkpoint 2.3.

It's my opinion that we don't have to say this since to conform at  all to WCAG 1.0 you must conform at least a level-A. However, if people  feel that saying level-A explicitly clarifies the minimal requirement,  I'm ok with this proposal.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

This is exactly the type of device we are *not* catering to in these  Guidelines. That particular device would be extremely useful  for many users (Can you get me one??), but it's not the general  purpose device the guidelines are designed to address.     > As I look at the guidelines I've got to admit that as it reads you've got  > to accommodate all disabilities to get a level A.

For background information on conformance approaches/proposals  considered by the WG, please refer to [1]. In particular, refer to  Al's initial proposal for a conformance provision based  on user profile [2].

Though a difficult decision to exclude (de facto) assistive technologies  from the conformance umbrella, the WG reached consensus on this issue,  as documented by the Chair in [3]. The resolution states:       The User Agent Guidelines conformance clause will not      distinguish between classes of users agents.    Vendors of any type of software may claim conformance, but the  checkpoints  are geared at desktop graphical browsers and other general purpose  tools. Unfortunately, but by consensus necessary for the timely  completion  of this version of the Guidelines, this will probably prevent many  assistive technologies from being able to claim conformance.     - Ian    [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0447.html    >   > At 08:41 AM 12/3/99 -0500, Denis Anson wrote:  >   > > >  > > > LRK: I think this is overly restrictive if the UA has accessibility  > > > built-in.

      Hello,    The 10 February 1999 draft of the Guidelines [1] is now available.    The list of changes [2] since the 12 November draft  is available at the Web site. There are quite a number   of changes to the checkpoints based on the Cambridge   face-to-face meeting and email since then.     We encourage your comments on this document. The most  effective way to comment is to clearly indicate:    1) The version of the document you are referring to (by URL)  2) The section of the document you are referring to.  3) The issue you have with the guideline, checkpoint, or text     By raising issues clearly, we will be able to resolve     them more quickly in teleconferences and by email.  4) Any proposed text you would like to see in the document.    The Next Draft is scheduled for Friday 5 March.  Stay tuned to the Working Group home page [3] for  more information     - Ian and Jon    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/changes  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      Hello,    Please consider the following proposal, which I hope resolves a few  remaining conformance issues:    1) Is a given checkpoint for content only, for the user agent's      features only, or for both?    2) How should conformance work for pointing device and voice input?    3) Which checkpoints do I have to satisfy to conform?    Reference document: 19 March 2001 draft [0]  [0] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010319/    ==========  Proposal 1  Label checkpoints for content, user agent, or both.  ==========     There are currently 87 checkpoints in the document. Some of them  apply to author-supplied content only, some to components of  the user agent only, and some to both. I am quite convinced of  the following:    a) Forty-five checkpoints apply to author-supplied content only:      Guidelines 2, 3, 4 (except 4.16), 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.9,    Guideline 8, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, and 11.2.    b) Thirty-two checkpoints apply to components of the user agent only     (i.e., everything but the content):      1.2, 6.4, 6.7, Guideline 7, Guideline 9, 10.6-10.10, 11.1,    11.3-11.6, and Guideline 12.    c) Seven checkpoints apply to both:      1.1, 4.16, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8, 6.10, and 10.2.    Today, we have "informative" labels for identifying whether a  checkpoint is for content only, for the user agent only, or for both.  I think we need to make this clear in a normative fashion and propose  the following:    a) At the end of each checkpoint statement, next to the priority,     indicate (using some sort of label) whether the checkpoint is for     content only, for the user agent only, or for both.    b) Add a conformance section to which these labels would link       (and introduce the labels at the beginning of section 2 on      the structure of a checkpoint definition). The conformance     section might read something like this:      <NEW 3.x>    3.x Checkpoints for content, user agent features, or both      For some requirements of this document, "content" (the document    object) is distinguished from "user agent features" (everything    else besides the document object). User agent features include    functionalities provided by the user agent out of the box, native    user interface components, documentation, focus and selection, etc.      For conformance, a user agent is required to satisfy the    requirements of the checkpoint for content only, for user agent    features only, or for both.    </NEW 3.x>    c) Delete the various informative groupings:       * Checkpoints for content accessibility      * Checkpoints for user interface accessibility     * Checkpoints for communication with other software     * Checkpoints for accessible documentation       Note: Some of them are already misleading in the 19 March 2001     draft. For instance, checkpoint 1.1 is listed as being for     the user interface, but it also applies to content.    d) Add to the definition of DOM something like the following     statement:       "Most of the requirements of this document apply to content (i.e.,     the document object) after its construction. However, a few     checkpoints (e.g., 2.7, 2.8, and 2.10) may affect the construction     of the DOM."    e) Reformat the checklist so that checkpoints are no longer grouped     according to the labels of (c) but rather according to whether     for content, for ui, or for both.    ==========  Proposal 2  Conformance for pointing device input and voice input  ==========     I recently sent a proposal [1] for addressing some concerns about  conformance for pointing device input and voice input. I'd like  to amend that proposal slightly.    a) To conform, all input device requirements must be satisfied for     the keyboard.    b) To conform for pointing device input and voice input, the same     input device requirements must be satisfied for those input     devices, substituting "voice" or "pointing device" for "keyboard"     wherever it appears (namely in checkpoints 1.1, 6.7, 9.3, and 11.3).       However, there is one exception to this rule: checkpoint 11.3     refers to *single key access*. This requirement does not (I would     argue very strongly) translate to pointing device and voice input.     (I would argue this strongly because, while ease of access is     certainly a consideration, we developed this requirement very     specifically for single-physical-key access. I would not want     to try to generalize in this document to "single spoken gesture",     for example).        Because checkpoint 11.3 includes some requirements that are     specific to the keyboard and some that are not, I propose to split     the checkpoint in two (so that conformance will be easier to     understand). This would give:         11.3a Allow the user to override any binding that is part of the       user agent default input configuration. The user agent is not       required to allow the user to override standard bindings for the       operating environment (e.g., for access to help). [Priority 2]         11.3b Allow the user to override any binding in the default       keyboard configuration with a binding of a single key and       (possibly zero) modifier keys. Allow the user to assign a single       key binding (with zero modifier keys) to at least a majority of       the functionalities available in the default keyboard       configuration. [Priority 2]    c) Update the input modality label definitions as follows:       Pointer:       This input modality label refers to all of the input device       requirements of this document, applied to pointing device       input, except for checkpoint 11.3b. For all other        checkpoints, substitute "pointing device" for "keyboard"       in the checkpoints.       Voice:       This input modality label refers to all of the input device       requirements of this document, applied to voice input,       except for checkpoint 11.3b. For all other        checkpoints, substitute "voice input" for "keyboard"       in the checkpoints.    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0452    ==========  Proposal 3  Some edits to section 3.1 Conformance model  ==========    <NEW 3.1>    The conformance model of this document has been designed to allow  different types of user agents with different input and output  capabilities to conform. At the same time, this flexible model  includes requirements about conformance claims themselves so that:     a) people reading claims can determine whether a conforming user   agent is likely to meet their accessibility needs, and     b) people can compare claims about disparate user agents with   relative ease. Note: The checklist [UAAG10-CHECKLIST] may be   used when evaluating a user agent for conformance.    The conformance model works as follows:     - A user agent conforms to this document by satisfying a set of   requirements. Conformance requirements *only* come from the   checkpoint statements. Each checkpoint statement includes one or   more requirements.      - Different user agents may conform to different sets of   checkpoints.  The formula below explains how to calculate a set   of requirements that must be satisfied for conformance.     - Conformance claims must indicate how the set of requirements   chosen for the claim differs from the "default" set. Please note   that this document includes both conformance requirements and   conformance claim requirements.    The "default" set of requirements for conformance consists of all  the requirements of all of the checkpoints. A user agent  "conforms unconditionally" to this document if it satisfies all  of the requirements of all of the checkpoints.    A user agent "conforms conditionally" if it satisfies any set of  requirements that results from carrying out all of the following  steps:     1) Choose a conformance level. Each conformance level   corresponds to a set of checkpoints (and thus a set of   requirements).     2) Remove the requirements associated with any unsupported   content type labels. In order to conform conditionally, a user   agent must satisfy the requirements of at least one content type   label.     3) Remove the requirements of any checkpoints or parts of   checkpoints that do not apply.    Note: In the default set of requirements, the only input device  requirements relate to keyboard input.  It is also possible to  claim conformance for pointing device input and voice input; see  the section on input modality labels.    EXAMPLE    Consider a user agent with these capabilities:     * it supports keyboard and pointing device input;   * it renders text (in color) and several formats for     images, audio, and animations;   * it hands of video to a plug-in;   * it doesn't support speech output.    Step 1) Choose a conformance level. The claimant wishes to  conform at level Double-A.  The resulting set of requirements  consists of all of the requirements of all the priority 1 and 2  checkpoints.    Step 2) Remove requirements related to content type labels.  The claimant wishes to claim conformance for the user  agent's support of text, images, audio, and video, but no other  animation formats. Since video is supported through a plug-in,  the plug-in must be in the conformance claim. The following  content type labels are therefore relevant: VisualText,  ColorText, Image, Animation, Video, and Audio. This means that:     * the claimant must remove the set of requirements associated     with the Speech content type label.     * the claimant must satisfy the requirements associated with     the other content type labels.    Step 3) Remove requirements that do not apply. Consider  checkpoint 4.4, for example, which is associated with both the  Audio and Animation content type labels:     4.4 Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of audio and   animations (including video and animated images). For a visual   track, provide at least one setting between 40% and 60% of the   original speed. For a prerecorded audio track including audio-only   presentations, provide at least one setting between 75% and 80% of   the original speed. When the user agent allows the user to slow the   visual track of a synchronized multimedia presentation to between   100% and 80% of its original speed, synchronize the visual and   audio tracks. Below 80%, the user agent is not required to render   the audio track. The user agent is not required to satisfy this   checkpoint for audio and animations whose recognized role is to   create a purely stylistic effect. [Priority 1]    Suppose that:     a) The claimant wishes to claim support for two audio formats;   b) The claimant wishes to claim support for one video format;   c) The claimant does not wish to claim support for two      animation formats (since the user agent doesn't       satisfy the requirements of 4.4 for those implemented formats);   d) The claimant does not wish to claim support for synchronized      multimedia (since the user agent doesn't       implement any synchronized multimedia formats).    The resulting requirements from this checkpoint would be:     a) For the audio formats:      Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of audio.  For a      prerecorded audio track including audio-only presentations,      provide at least one setting between 75% and 80% of the original      speed.     b) For the video format:      Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of video. For a      visual track, provide at least one setting between 40% and 60% of      the original speed.       c) Limitation of scope for any format:      The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for      audio and animations whose recognized role is to create a purely      stylistic effect.    The following requirements do not apply:     a) When the user agent allows the user to slow the visual track of a      synchronized multimedia presentation to between 100% and 80% of its      original speed, synchronize the visual and audio tracks. Below 80%,      the user agent is not required to render the audio track.        The relevant applicability provision is provision three:      control of a content property that the subject cannot      recognize. In this case, no format implemented by the user      agent supports synchronized multimedia.    Step 4) Construct a well-formed conformance claim. For this  example (in addition to other required information), the claim must  include the following information:     a) Conformance level Double-A   b) Information about the subject, in this case the combination      of a multimedia user agent and a plug-in for rendering video.   c) Content type labels: "This user agent does not support       the requirements of the Speech content type label. This      user agent supports the requirements of the Animation      content type label for the format X, but does not for the      formats Y and Z."   d) Requirements that do not apply: "The synchronized multimedia      requirements of checkpoint 4.4 do not apply because the user      agent does not implement any formats that support      synchronized multimedia.       Note: Since the user agent does not meet the requirements of the  Pointer and Voice input modality labels, the claim does not  include them.  </NEW 3.1>    Comment:     a) I refer to "requirements" rather than "checkpoints" throughout  this section since a single checkpoint may include more than one  requirement. I need to make sure that section 3 uses the term  "requirement" rather than "checkpoint" in a uniform manner.

What if I configure the text size to be "12pt" as allowed  by my Netscape Navigator? What does 12pt refer to? Not  all text, then headings would be the same size as  paragraph text and so forth.     So either the user can specify one text size and we should  say what that one size applies to. Or the user should be  able to specify N text sizes to N different element types.  And that's what I don't want to require of the user agent  as a P1 requirement. (More precisely, I don't think that  that's what the current 4.1 requires. If we want to   require N different text size configurations, then we should  need to discuss that further).    The difference with 4.2 is that it does make sense to  apply a font family (e.g., Arial) to all text, whatever element  it comes from. Of course, you might want finer control than  that, but the current 4.2 only makes a global requirement.     - Ian    > >  Note on 4.1: I have chosen "paragraph" text (which is  > >  very HTML-centric) consciously.

      Constantine,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed the  non-editorial last call issues (443-446) you raised;  please refer to the email source of the issues [0].    The complete second last call issues list [1] is available  online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been  incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].      NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call    draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have    been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.    Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with  the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do  not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The  Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the  disposition of comments or not. More information about the  process we are following is available in section 5.5.2 of the W3C  Process Document [3].    On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments,     - Ian    [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0333  [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    ===============================================  The UAWG disagreed with you on the following:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #446: Checkpoint 6.1: Consider making the checkpoint scalable  (variable priority linked to WCAG)     Comment: Rather than make what is now checkpoint 8.1 a    relative priority checkpoint the UAWG has decided that the   UAAG 1.0 must "lead" here: if user agents do not support   the P3 features required by WCAG 1.0, then it is likely   that authors will never have the chance to use them. Thus, the   requirement remains        "8.1 Implement the accessibility features of all implemented     specifications (markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata     languages, graphics formats, etc.). The accessibility features of a     specification are those identified as such and those that satisfy     all of the requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility     Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10]. [Priority 1]"    ===============================================  The UAWG agreed with you:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse)  specific events      Comment: I believe that our revisions to checkpoints 9.1-9.7    address your concern that users be able to activate device-dependent    event handlers in a device-independent manner.     ---------------------  #444: Guideline 1 rationale needs clarification      Comment: The introduction has been revised and the relationship    between the requirements of this document and the impact on    assistive technologies should be much clearer. Guideline 1 rationale    has been reduced to discussion of input and output redundancy.    ===============================================  The UAWG answered your question:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #445: Checkpoint 1.3: What about systems that do not use the keyboard  at all, but provide accessibility solutions?      Comment: This document has been designed for systems in which    the keyboard is fundamental for access (it assumes that it is).    This may exclude some software, but that software was not the    target of UAAG 1.0. The conformance section states:         "Note: Conformance to the requirements of this document is       expected to be a strong indicator of accessibility, but it is       neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for ensuring the       accessibility of software. Some software may not conform to this       document but still be accessible to some users with       disabilities. Conversely, software may conform to this document       but still be inaccessible to some users with disabilities. Please       refer to the section on the scope of requirements for conforming       user agents."    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    In the 9 March draft [1], checkpoint 2.2 includes some  information about what constitutes a text format:     "Text formats include all of the following:       1) all media objects given an Internet media type of "text"        (e.g., text/plain, text/HTML, or text/*).        Refer to [RFC2046], section 4.1 for information       about the "text" Internet media type.       2) all SGML and XML applications regardless of Internet        Media Type (e.g., HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, SMIL, SVG, etc.)."    I think this belongs in the checkpoint as part of the   (minimal) requirement.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Per my action from the 17 November face-to-face meeting [1],  please consider this proposal for addressing issue 348 [2]  (characterized by Al as editorial). Checkpoint and other UAAG  references here are with respect to the 23 October draft [3].    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116.html#issue-348  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#348  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    ========================  Summary of the proposal:  ========================    1) Include requirements that the user agent provide mechanisms  for highlighting selection, focus, recently visited links, and  active elements.    2) Include requirements that, by default, the highlight  mechanisms (whether visual or aural) for selection, focus,  recently visited links, and active elements:        a) Not rely on color alone.   b) Differ from each other, and not by color alone.   c) Differ in style from the user agent's default text style      (e.g., color information, font information).    3) Include requirements that the user be able to configure how     selection, focus, recently visited links, and active elements     are highlighted.    4) Include a requirement that the user be able to configure      the default foreground and background colors for visually     rendered text.     5) Related ideas that are not requirements:     a) Caution that user that if they override the defaults for       any one of these mechanisms, they may have to pay attention       to the others.   b) Suggest that the user agent allow the user to configure      them all at once.    ============  CHECKPOINTS:  ============    There is only one new checkpoint proposed (8.X, which is  essentially factored out of several others). There are also some  clarifications and harmonization done.      4.3 Allow the user to configure the foreground and background     color of all text, with an option to override foreground and     background colors specified by the author or user agent     defaults. Allow the user to select from among the range of     system colors.         Note: User configuration of foreground and background colors       may result in the inability to distinguish unhighlighted       text from selected text, focused text, etc. See checkpoint       8.X for more information about highlight styles.       [This proposal supersedes:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0457.html]      4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus and     current selection are highlighted (e.g., through foreground     and background color, voice pitch, etc.).        Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about        highlight styles.       [This proposal is based on the version from the 14 December teleconf:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0420.html]      8.2 Provide a mechanism for highlighting recently visited     links.  Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.        Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about        highlight styles.    8.3 Provide a mechanism for highlighting links that have been     marked up to indicate that following them will involve a fee     ("fee links"). Allow the user to configure the highlighting     style.        Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about        highlight styles.      [However, refer to proposal to demote 8.3 and add a config     requirement:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0458.html]      8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current     viewport. The default highlight mechanism must not rely on     color alone.      8.8 Provide a mechanism for highlighting active elements.     Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.       Note: For example, most graphical user agents highlight all       the links on a page so that users know where to       interact. See checkpoint 8.X for more information about       highlight styles.      8.X Ensure that the default highlight styles for the     selection, focus, active elements, recently visited links, and     fee links (1) do not rely on color alone, and (2) differ from     each other and not by color alone. [Priority 1]               Note: For instance, a graphical user agent by default might       present the selection using color and a dotted outline, the       focus using a solid outline, active elements as underlined       in blue, recently visited links as dotted underlined in       purple, and fee links using a special icon or flag to draw       the user's attention.         Note: If the user overrides the default styling for any one       of these mechanisms, the new styling may interfere with the       others. Therefore, the user agent should allow the user to       configure them all at once or should alert the user to       potential conflicts when change are made.    ======  ISSUES  ======    1) For checkpoints 8.2, 8.3 and 8.8 (related to links and active  elements): Does the user agent have to show all active zones of a  client-size image map?  Does the user agent have to highlight as  a recently visited link a zone of an image map? Should these  checkpoints refer to text links alone?    ==============  OTHER COMMENTS  ==============    1) I support Jon's proposal to modify (essentially delete)  checkpoint 8.6 (issue 421):    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0447.html    Thank you,     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Inline style information attached to elements is exposed through the  >     style attribute of the DOM2 Style Module.     Gregory,     Good catch. Here are some comments:    1) For XML applications, style and all other information will be     available through the Core module. This means that assistive  technologies     can calculate anything they want given the same document object as  the     communicating user agent.    2) For HTML, the "style" attribute is *not* available through the     HTML module. From section 1.5.4 of the DOM Proposed Recommendation  [1]:        "Note: The style attribute of an HTML element is accessible through        the ElementCSSInlineStyle interface which is defined in the CSS  module        [DOM Level 2 Style Sheets and CSS]."       This means that unless the CSS module (or part of it) is implemented,     ATs will not have access to inline style information (i.e., some part  of     content).       [1]  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20000927/html.html#ID-011100101    3) The Style Sheets module consists of two parts: an abstract style     sheets part (which gives access to style defined via the     "style" attribute) and a CSS-specific part.    So:    ========  PROPOSED: Split checkpoint 5.7 into two parts.  ========      a) For user agents that support style sheets, provide programmatic      access to style sheet information by conforming to the W3C      Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Chapter 1      "Document Object Module Style Sheets" and exporting the      interfaces it defines. [Priority 1]       b) For user agents that implement Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS1],       [CSS2]), provide programmatic access to CSS style sheets by       conforming to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2       CSS module, Chapter two "Document Object Module CSS"        and exporting the interfaces it defines. [Priority 3]     Note that the priority of the first checkpoint is P1, otherwise  ATs will not have access to embedded or linked styles.    As to establishing the priority of the second checkpoint,   I would argue that any piece of software that implements the  APIs provided by that module must be almost, if not entirely,  a CSS user agent. The DOM CSS module provides convenience  interfaces to structures and values of a CSS style sheet,  quick access to the style attribute, the ability to insert  and delete rules in a style sheet, and (probably most   attractively) access to computed values. I would argue that  any AT that implements the API, in order to make use of  the computed value, must know enough about CSS (and implement  enough of it) that it could probably compute the value  itself (given access to the DOM and the style sheets). So  the question is, I think: is having access to the computed  value a P1 requirement, or more of a convenience? I think that  in the past, we have argued (and Gregory has objected) that  providing the computed value was not a P1 requirement.    One reason is that CSS computed values (as defined in   section 6.1.2 of the CSS2 specification [2]) are a step  removed from "actual values", which are "computed values  after any approximations have been applied." In other  words, the user agent may not be able to use a computed  value and therefore make modifications to it that will  not be reflected through the DOM CSS module. So the goal  of providing information to ATs about "what's on the screen"  is not entirely met by the CSS DOM.     Summarizing why I don't think that CSS DOM support should  be a P1 requirement (nor P2, though I feel less strongly  about that):    1) Information is available through the Style Sheets module     (bug fixed thanks to Gregory).    2) ATs would probably have to be almost, if not entirely,     CSS agents to make use of the DOM CSS API.    3) The DOM CSS module may not solve the problem completely     anyway.     - Ian    [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#computed-value    >     This is extremely important,  >     as inline style attributes are particularly difficult (if not impossible)  >     for most users to either anticipate and/or change/tailor/transform into  >     something useable by that user by use of a client-side stylesheet.

      Hello,    I have published the 7 July 2000 UA Guidelines [1] and  Techniques [2] documents. The full list of changes is  online [3] and included as text below.    ATTENTION: This is a very important draft and I entreat  the entire Working Group to review it. We are nearing  last call again and will be ready to go after we resolve the  remaining open issues. We only have about 12-15 checkpoints  with minimal requirements left to resolve, and there are proposals  out for all but two of them. I hope to go to last call in the  next few weeks. Please review this draft!    NOTE:     Due to mirroring issues, some links may be broken temporarily.    ABOUT THE CHANGES:    The primary changes concern folding minimal requirements  into the checkpoints. There were two parts to this  exercise:     a) Folding minimal requirements that the WG has      discussed and which are recorded in "Determining      Conformance to the UA Guidelines" [4].     b) Folding in requirements that were in Notes into      the checkpoints. The WG did not discuss this prior      to this draft, although I did send an alert [5] to the WG      in April about this. Please consider this draft my      attempt to clarify exactly what is required by each      checkpoint. The remaining note information should only      include examples, references, and clarifications about      the scope of the checkpoint (e.g., what the checkpoint      does not mean).    Here's what did not get done in this draft:     - Review/refinement of multimedia terms (refer to issue 289)     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#289     - Additional minimal requirement proposals not yet reviewed by     the Working Group.     - Some techniques proposals that have not yet been incorporated.    I hope that you like this draft and that you agree with me that  it's the right direction for the document.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000707  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0192.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    CHANGES:    Versions [5]WD-UAAG10-20000707 and [6]WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000707          [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707        [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000707       These documents incorporate more resolutions to issues raised during     the Proposed Recommendation review and other changes based on Working     Group discussion of thoses issues. In particular, this version of the     document folds in some results of the minimal requirements  discussion.     Refer also to [7]Determining Conformance to the UA Guidelines.          [7] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs      General changes         * Added link to WAI Technical Activity statement.       * 1.3 How the guidelines are organized. Two important change:           1. It is now stated clearly that the notes after the  checkpoints              are only normative. All normative information is moved into              the checkpoint text itself. The Notes are distinguished from              the checkpoint text in two ways: markup (DT v. DD) and the              notes begin with the word "Note".           2. After the discussion of checkpoint organization, there is              discussion of minimal requirements.        Changes to checkpoints         * 1.1: Moved normative requirements from Note to checkpoint.       * 1.2: Moved normative requirements from Note to checkpoint.       * 1.3: Moved normative requirements from Note to checkpoint.       * 1.5: Moved normative requirements from Note to checkpoint.       * 2.2: Minimal requirement (pause) incorporated.       * 2.5: Minimal requirement (URI/type) incorporated. Note, however,         that this only applies when non-text content is included by         reference.       * 2.6: Edited to match wording of 2.5. Note expanded with example         and reference to WCAG 1.0       * 3.1: turn on/off changed to "not render". Note expanded with         rationale and suggested technique in this case. This requirement         may be expanded in a future draft.       * Old 3.2 deleted.       * 3.2: (Old 3.3) Freeze video changed to "not render". This         requirement may be expanded in a future draft.       * Old 3.4 deleted.       * 3.3: (Old 3.5) Min requirement incorporated (motionless text).       * 3.4: (Old 3.6) Min requirement incorporated (motionless images).       * 3.5: (Old 3.7) Wording changed to "not execute".       * 3.6: (Old 3.8) Min requirement incorporated (manual access).       * 3.7: (Old 3.9) Min requirement incorporated (manual access).       * 3.8: (Old 3.10) on/off images changed to "not render". This         requirement may be expanded in a future draft.       * 4.1: Added min requirement for font size. (system)       * 4.2: Added min requirement for font family (system)       * 4.3: Added min requirement for color (system)       * 4.4: Added min requirement for color (system)       * 4.5: Added min requirement for audio, video, animations.       * 4.6: Added "resume" to list of control requirements, per         resolution of [8]22 June teleconference.       * 4.7: Added min requirement (range of positions available to         author).       * 4.8, 4.9: Two volume checkpoints about global and independent         volume control. Old checkpoints 3.2 and 3.4 deleted, per         resolution of [9]22 June teleconference.       * 4.10: (Old 4.9) Add min requirements per [10]6 July         teleconference.       * 4.11: Add min requirements per [11]6 July teleconference.

      Hello,    Part of issue 413 [1] involved the question of whether what is  now checkpoint 8.2 (in the 9 March draft [2]) was meant to apply   only to content. The Working Group resolved that it was only meant   to apply to content. There was no change to the document as  a result of the resolution, mostly because the  WG felt that   the label "Checkpoints for content accessibility" was a  sufficient indicator.    However, we decided on 9 January 2001 that the labels  were informative only, it is not so clear that they suffice  to convey the information that checkpoint 8.2 (and others) are  for content only.    Eric Hansen has also raised this issue (and others related to  conformance) with me privately, and suggested that we probably   need to do a better job making clear which checkpoints  apply only to content provided by the author, which apply only  to the user agent's "native" features, and which (like   checkpoint 1.1) apply to both.    This email does not contain a proposal, only a heads-up that the  editors will be discussing this topic and seeking ways to clarify  and simplify this conformance issue.      - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#413  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0071.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

If the author can't         position stuff, then what's required? There may be technologies         where you can't reposition (e.g., text is "burned into"         video).        KB: I agree with Al's statement, but wouldn't go so far          as to require arbitrary positioning.       RS: I think that arbitrary position will not solve all of the         problems that Al discusses. At some point, with magnification,         you should have speech output at the same time, so positioning         is irrelevant.       DP: But then you are in the realm of the AT. This is a checkpoint         for graphical user agents. Two issues: (1) ability to move in or         out of the way (2) CD issues - you could be confused if the         information is at the bottom or top.       RS: I'm concerned about how many P1s we have.       GR: I don't think we should politicize the priorities.        IJ: Let's not go there. Please consider three cases:       1) Author can position arbitrarily. So user should be able to, as           well.       2) Content is fused, so UA not required to separate them.       3) Content is not fused, but author can't position either.              IJ: I think we're most concerned with case three here: what          should the user agent be required to do?       RS: If you've got text in the source, you've got to display it         anyway (checkpoint 2.1). I would like to defer to Madeleine.       RS: Technically speaking, I don't see where the big hit on this         checkpoint is : you have to render it anyway.        RS: Magnifiers generally magnify around the focus. Presumably this         piece of text would not have focus. In this case, the user         would have to (at this magnification level) move the text into         view. While the video is playing, even if you reposition,         how would anyone be able to use the captions? My gut feeling,         having worked on software like this, at that magnification         level, it would be very difficult to keep up with          streaming video content and moving text. I think the user will         need auditory support.       KB: Not just magnification. If I've lost some field of vision, I         may need to be able to position the text (arbitrarily) to         make use of my peripheral vision.       RS: I can see your point for that one.          KB: I can imaging a video where you would want to obscure part         of the video because you need access to something else. So         obscuring is not always a problem and may be useful.       DP: What we are after in this checkpoint, is making the captions         accessible. It doesn't matter that the video is occluded since         the focus of this checkpoint is to make the text viewable.       RS: I will abide by what Madeleine recommends.       Action IJ: Write email asking for input from Madeleine on what      the priority should be.    10) PR#211: Do we need to say "alt equivs that have been marked up as              such" in 2.1 and 2.5?        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#211       IJ: Refer to proposal to resolve this with additional     "applicability" provision.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0104.html       Resolved: Adopt proposal.

I think we can  drop the mention of conformance. I would drop everything from "For  example" to "Triple-A", but I could see that the keyboard proponents  might  like the keyboard mention in the abstract.

      Hello,    I've published the 28 July 2000 UA Guidelines [1] and  Techniques [2] documents (refer to the list of changes [3],  which have been quoted below).     The issues list [4] and Determining Conformance  to the UA Guidelines [5] are up to date. The latter indicates  which checkpoints have not yet had their minimal requirements  finalized; it is based on an earlier draft, but corresponds  closely in checkpoint numbering to this draft.    I implemented Eric's proposed multimedia definitions in this  draft, but did not yet re-read the document to see whether  all the terms are used consistently in the document (This  is on my todo list).    I incorporated some editorial changes that are also on the  issues list but are so benign that I incorporated them in  this draft. These are:      a) Rewrote checkpoint 7.2 to try to clarify.    b) Added a statement to the definition of active element       about when elements may be inactive    c) Added a note to checkpoint 8.8 to clarify that it's about       semantics, not rendering.    Happy reading,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000728  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000728/  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html  [4] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html  [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs    CHANGES:    Versions WD-UAAG10-20000728 and WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000728      General changes         * The word "presentation" is no longer used to mean rendering.       * Added Tim Lacy to active list of WG participants.      Changes to Guidelines         * Guideline 1: Added some information to rationale based on [7]G1         comments from Eric Hansen.       * Guideline 3: Made some changes to prose of guideline to account         for [8]proposal to make G3 about global configuration only. Added         cross references from checkpoints in G3 to checkpoints in G4.         Refer to resolution at [9]27 July teleconference.      Changes to Checkpoints         * 2.6: Added a Note that this is a repair checkpoint.       * 3.2: New. Added per [10]27 July teleconference.       * 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5: Now about configuration to not render  globally         per [11]27 July teleconference.       * Edited Also, deleted the applicability part (about using font         families) based on a [12]4.1 request from CMN.       * 4.9: Volume control of synchronized sources. Refer to resolution         of [13]13 July teleconference.       * 4.11: New (old, actually) about synthesized speech. Refer to         resolution of [14]13 July teleconference.       * 6.1: Updated with min reqs per [15]13 July teleconference.       * 7.2: Editorial changes in part based on a [16]suggestion from  CMN.       * 7.5: Search requirements changed per resolution of [17].       8.1: Updated per [18]13 July teleconference. Also, edited Note  after         checkpoint.       * 8.2, 8.3: Rewritten to make sense for a set of links (not just a         single link) and to make the minimal rendering reqs per the  [19]27         July teleconference.       * 8.8: Added a note that this checkpoint is only about semantics,         not presentation (refer to [20]issue 301).       * 10.4: Modified per [21]27 July teleconference. Note: The         checkpoint does not refer to a minimal list of functionalities  yet         since there is a [22]proposal for changing 10.8.       * 10.5: Now about keyboard only, per the [23]27 July  teleconference.         Refer to Note about changes to 10.4.       * 14.3, 14.4: Updated like 8.2 and 8.3 per the [24]27 July         teleconference. Also added requirement that default focus         highlight be different from default selection highlight      Changes to Glossary         * To definition of active element, added a sentence about elements         that are sometimes inactive (refer to [25]issue 298).       * Added a paragraph about "levels of configuration/control" to  those         defintions.       * Implemented [26]Eric's multimedia terms. However, I did not  review         the impact of this change in the document.      Changes to References         * Added WEBCHAR for terminology.      Changes to Techniques       While there were a few changes to the techniques document, they are     not really worth documenting.      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I think the requirement that you're making is  covered by checkpoint 2.1 and some checkpoints in Guidelines 3 and 4.   Were you proposing an additional requirement, or were you thinking  that this should be in the Techniques Document as advice to  developers?     > Guideline 7  >   > In framesets, the frame can have an attribute "scrolling" set to no.

That sounds like a good technique to me. But I'd put it in Guideline  2 (access to content).

What browser are you using? It sounds like a bug in the browser that  doesn't let you access all of the active elements in the documnet.     > Guideline 10  >   > Some frames are made large enough to view their contents with "standard"  > configuration. however, in some times a user has "non-standard" config, so a  > user should be able to command user agent to ignore some frame attributes  > ("scrolling", "resize" "border", for example).    Again, that sounds like good technique material for Guideline two  on access to content. I don't believe the user agent would be  in violation of the HTML spec if it ignored some attributes in an  attempt  to provide access to content.     > I know that I'm not supposed to provide such kind of feedback, but these  > things I'm encountering and not all authors of a content like my mails  > asking them to remove a directive "scrolling=no" from their framed pages.

It is used in very few locations.    We started using "continuous equivalent" in the SMIL access note [1].  We distinguish there between discrete equivalent (like "alt") and  one that must be synchronized with another track.

Hmm, you're right!

[Priority 1]".     I have no objection to synchronized equivalent.

I would think more explanation is needed.)    The goal: assistive technologies, to function, must have timely access  to information. Thus, for example, it should be possible to load  them into the process space of the user agent to minimize communication  times.     > The deletion of "continuous equivalent track" affects checkpoint 2.5 and  > the glossary.

So, I propose the following simplification (I hope simplification):       For user agents that offer history mechanisms, when the user     returns to a previous view, restore the point of regard in the     viewport.    And this note:       For example, when users navigate "back" and "forth"      among views, for each view they should find the     viewport position where they left it.    >  The  > standard back and forward buttons of a browser are typical  > examples of changing views, I think.    So change the note to:       For example, when users navigate "back" and "forth"      among views, for each view they should find the     viewport position where they left it.      > For a user agent that is presenting content for people who are  > blind this is an especially important feature.

Yours are important comments and I agree that there should be more  context for readers new to the subject. Since there are three sets  of guidelines, we plan on providing separate resources (e.g.,   descriptions of assistive technologies) that may be referenced  by all three sets.     Of course, we welcome more detailed suggestions about how to  introduce these topics to new readers. Also, any suggested text  (without going so far as to ask for your internal guidelines  document...) would be appreciated.     > In the techniques section, it  is not obvious as to who needs to  > implement what.

      Hello,    I have published the 4 May draft of the AU Techniques  document as a Note [1]. Here's the status section:    <BLOCKQUOTE>     This document is a W3C Note, published as an informative      appendix to "Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0".      This document updates the previous version of this Note      but does not represent consensus within the WAI Authoring      Tools Guidelines (AUWG) Working Group, nor within W3C. This     document is likely to change and should not be cited as      reference material or anything other than "work in progress".     The WAI Interest Group was invited to review the material      that led to this version of the document. The Working Group     expects to update this document in response to queries     raised by implementors of the Guidelines, for example,     to cover new technologies. Suggestions for additional     techniques are welcome.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    I don't have a list of changes available, so I will let   Charles provide that list.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-ATAG10-TECHS-20000504/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I will state more clearly at this point that the notes do not include  requirements that are part of conformance, such as :        "Informative notes about the checkpoint. These notes do not      include requirements that must be satisfied as part of      conformance; they are informative only. They are meant to clarify      the scope of the checkpoint through further description, examples,      cross references, and commentary."

There are advantages to both for assistive technologies, or ATs.

I think that in general, performance issues that affect  everyone equally are not specifically accessibility issues. In  general, we don't include requirements to solve problems that affect  all users (including users with disabilities).     >Guideline 4   >2nd para   >   >this seems to be more content provider requirements    That depends on the format. It is helpful for authors to be  aware of this, but since some formats (e.g., SMIL) allow the  specification of synchronization information explicitly, the  user agent can "know" enough to provide additional control  automatically.     >checkpoint 4.6   >   >this is specific to plug-in or accessibility application, where such   >requirements are listed, it will assist in alleviating confusion if  the   >specification pointed to a specific "user agent" -- otherwise it is  unclear   >as to which software should be responsible.    This is a conformance issue. If the conformance claim is "this browser  plus this plug-in (for checkpoint 4.6) meet the requirements of the  document", then there is no problem.     >section 4.10   >   >this seems specific to the OS    That may be the best way to satisfy the requirement.     >Guideline 5   >   >General comments:   >   >what is meant by timely?     This is indeed a hard question, and the Working Group is aware  that it may be difficult to verify conformance to this requirement -  it may vary from system to system, for example. Refer to issue 127 [10],  from the previous last call. The WG decided that this performance  requirement  was important, and that the techniques document would give a sense  about what performance is expected.

However, some edits are required due to the way  in which the DOM specs were split recently.     >checkpoint 5.7   >   >is this section referring to viewing the page or editing the page?     Good question - is this a read-only or a read-write requirement. I  suspect it is for both, but we have gone to the effort to distinguish  checkpoints 5.1 and 5.2, so I think we should do the same for checkpoint  5.7. Added as issue 448 [11].    [11] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#448    > Why would a user need to access the CSS when viewing a document?    This checkpoint is for programmatic access to style information,  which may benefit the assistive technology for a particular rendering.     >Guideline 7   >   >para #1   >   >by visual orientation or by structural orientation?      Structural.

We don't have a requirement for line-numbering, and that seems to  be an implementation issue that is solvable in any case.     >para #4   >   >via what mechanism? Should this be based on element?      That's one option, but elements alone may not provide the "proper"   level of abstraction. For instance, in HTML, it is useful to think of   headings as containers, not separators, for the construction of   a table of contents. Thus, in some cases, developers would do better   applying heuristics rather than sticking strictly to the DTD.     > What about incorrectly coded data?      That's an authoring problem. This document does not make repair   requirements for this case (refer to "scope", section 1.2).     > What about body element text? What about context sensitive data?    Some of the questions you ask are left open because developers may  offer different solutions to meeting the requirement, which is spelled  out in checkpoint 7.6 (at least to the best of the WG's ability, after  long deliberations).       >checkpoint 7.1   >   >What about contextual data such as mouse over data? The user  experience   >could get out of sync with the page. How should this be addressed?     I'm not sure I understand. First there is an authoring issue: if   authors provide content that is only accessible through scripts, they   fail WCAG 1.0 and that's out of scope for UAAG 1.0. Can you explain   how content that appears at a mouse-over event would constitute   a new viewport to which the user would have to be able to navigate?     >section 7.5, Note   >   >is this referring to the content in focus, or the page?    The WG will be clarifying that question (the answer is: the whole  page). Refer to issue 354 [12].    [12] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#354     >Guideline 8   >first list   >   list item (2)   >   >this is content provider issue    But it's also a user agent issue: to make available information  that has been required of the author by WCAG 1.0.     >checkpoints 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.9   >   >checkpoints 8.3, 8.4 and 8.9 are content provider issues, checkpoint  8.5 is   >partially content provider issues    As mentioned above, this document requires user agents to:     1) Make available information provided by the author   2) Calculate some information so that the author doesn't have to       provide redundant content. For instance, Amaya     (http://www.w3.org/Amaya) generates an outline view based on      document headings.      >checkpoint 9.2   >   >each platform has different conventions, resulting in confusion to the  user,   >when or if they utilize multiple platforms    That is true. I don't believe that resolving conflicts among different  platform conventions is in scope for this document. I think it does  make sense that a user agent running on a particular platform (even if  designed to be able to work cross-platform) should be well-integrated  into that world, which includes observing conventions for that  platform and avoiding conflicts.     >checkpoint 9.3   >   >single key? based on the context of the focus, this could drastically  affect   >the document, I would suspect that the author is indicating the usage  of the   >function keys, however, it is unclear.

      Hello,    I have some additional comments with respect to the 14 August draft [0].  [0] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19980814.html    Section 4.2: Alternative Representations  - Currently, there is a phrase in section 3.4 that should not    be there: "When not supplied by the author, the user agent should    generate alternate text." That sentence was put in 3.4 (an    introductory paragraph) as a pre-cursor to later guidelines, but    it sounds too much like a guideline where it is. Furthermore,     there is not guideline that states this. Therefore, I propose    a guideline in section 4.2 that reads     "If the user has not specified alternative text,    the user agent must provide it." This should be a priority 1.    - Guideline 4.2.1     "Allow the user to specify how and where to render alternate     representations of information."       People seem concerned that this guideline is too vague and     may require too much of user agents. I propose we discuss     and refine it.    - Guideline 4.2.2    "Allow users to turn on/off the display of d-links in a document."       Has there been resolution on the identification of d-links? If     not, what should be done about this guideline?    Section 4.4: Alternate Representations of Audio, etc.  - Guideline 4.4.2: "Allow the user to turn on/off closed captioning       of audio, vido, movies, and animations." There is a statement about       support at the level of the operating system. I propose that this       be moved to a section on OS-level support and a link to that       section be left in its place.      Section 6.1 Sequential Navigation within a view  - Guideline 6.1.1 "Allow the user to use keyboard commands to     move sequentially from one link, element with "longdesc",     or form control to the next in the same view." What does     "next" mean? Is that document order? Tabbing order?    Section 7.2 Menu Commands  - Guideline 7.2.1 "Display keyboard navigation shortcut commands       in customizable menus." What does "customizable" mean? There       is no explanation.    - I propose that we clearly identify that which should be    done at the level of the operating system and that    which should be done by the browser. I have seen several    questions that straddle this fence, including:            - Keyboard access [1]          - System level flags related to closed captioning [2]      I think a section on what should be done at the OS level    (whether simply informative or more than that) might help.

      Hello,    I'm curious how people react to this proposal to address  issue 465 [1]: conformance for keyboard and pointing device  and voice input.    The current conformance model is "subtractive": you have to do  everything for unconditional conformance. What you don't do you must  announce in your claim (in essence subtracting some requirements from  the full set).    The model used to be additive: there was a core set of requirements  and you added to them in the claim. But this was complicated and  necessitated the definition of a "core set" of checkpoints. I'm glad  we don't have the concept of a core set of checkpoints anymore.    In between (it appeared in no draft, I think), I tried a hybrid model  where the content labels were subtractive and the input modalities  were additive. I abandoned it because I thought it made life more  complicated. I'm not so sure, given recent discussions we've had on  this topic.     Please consider the following proposal.    --------  PROPOSAL  --------    a) Checkpoint 1.1 only talks about the keyboard. Based on the     9 March draft, that would give:       "1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through     keyboard input alone."           "Note: For example, ensure that with keyboard input alone, the        user can interact with enabled elements, select content,        navigate viewports, configure the user agent, access        documentation, install the user agent, etc.    b) Add the following to the Note (this is informative only):        "This checkpoint means that all input device requirements of this      document must be satisfied through the keyboard. It is also      possible to conform for pointing device and voice input; see the      section on input modality labels."    c) Do not add checkpoints for voice/pointing device input.    d) I'm not quite sure what to do with the Guideline itself.     We resolved to delete the existing checkpoint 1.2 (since subsumed     by 1.1). That leaves two checkpoints, one for keyboard input     and one for text equivalent message in the UI. This means     that the Guideline is not really about "input and output     device-independence" any more (though that's a good principle!).       I can't find a good place to put checkpoint 1.3 (i.e., it doesn't     seem to fit in other Guidelines).           Suggestions welcome!     e) Do not change the section (3.1) on input modality labels.    f) Update the conformance model (3.1) since input modality     requirements are no longer subtracted from the equation.    g) Change condition 2 of section 3.3 (well-formed conformance claims)      from:          "Each input modality label is an assertion that the user agent        does not satisfy the requirements associated with the label."       to             "Each input modality label is an assertion that the user agent        satisfies the requirements associated with the label."      ----------  ADVANTAGES  ----------    There are at least two advantages to this approach:     a) I think it resolves Aaron's concern since the seeming      contradiction is dropped.     b) In general, it will make claims shorter since you won't have      to say all the time "I don't do voice or pointing device input."        Note: I have the *opposite* expectation for content type labels: I      expect conforming user agents to satisfy requirements for most      content type labels, and therefore there will be fewer exceptions       to document in a claim.    --------  QUESTION  --------    I hope people agree with me on the following point. Consider  checkpoint 12.3:        "12.3 Document the default input configuration (e.g., the default      keyboard bindings). [Priority 1]"    It is my understanding that when you claim conformance for the  keyboard only, that you only have to satisfy this checkpoint for the  keyboard. If you also claim conformance for pointing device and voice,  you must also satisfy this checkpoint for those input devices. If  you don't claim conformance for pointing device, you don't have to  document the default pointing device configuration.    If people agree with that (and the same reasoning applies to other  checkpoints, e.g., following operating environment conventions), then  I don't think there's a problem with the above proposal.     If people don't agree, then we need to figure out why there would be  some partial requirements for some input devices even when there is no  conformance requirement for those devices.

      Hello,    Gregory points out that checkpoint 2.3 in the 4 April  release of UAAG 1.0 Guidelines and Techniques is broken:  there's missing text.    This is a document production problem and will be  fixed. The checkpoint should start:    "[Allow] global configuration so that, ...."     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010404/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

            | When: 15 August 17:30Z (1:30pm EDT, 10:30am PDT) for one hour.        | Where: Longfellow bridge: +1 617 252 1038 and                 IRC [3]: irc.w3.org, port 6665, channel #spec-prod        | Invited: Anyone interested in discussing tools to help        |          people produce W3C technical reports.    Hello,    As follow up to the proposal [1] that Philippe and I sent   about publication tools for XMLSpec [2], I have reserved the   Longfellow bridge for a one-hour meeting. Please reply on   spec-prod@w3.org if you intend to attend the meeting.    Goals of the meeting:    1) Introductions <smile>. There are a number of Working Groups     using XMLSpec or some flavor of it for their specifications.    2) Identify existing tools and tool needs. [Note: I don't     want to talk about issues management tools at this meeting.]    3) Identify priority deliverables (e.g., any changes to XMLSpec,     XSLT transformation from XMLSpec to a W3C TR document).    4) Get people to work on these deliverables.     Some questions:    1) What tools do people already use with this DTD?  What      transformations can Philippe's Java tools perform?    2) Are there requirements on XMLSpec in order to meet      the needs of other Working Groups?    3) Who would like to help design an XSLT style sheet to     transform a XMLspec doc to a W3C technical report? To convert     an xhtml document to an XMLSpec document?    4) Do people know about W3C "comma tools" (If not, put a single     comma after any URI at w3.org to get help)? These tools      allow you to html validate, css validate, link check, and      perform other tests on documents residing at w3.org.    Other agenda items are welcome. I realize that 12 days notice  for this meeting is not much, and I apologize to those who  would like to attend but cannot. Please indicate whether  you would be interested in attending another call for which   there would be more advance notice.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/2000JulSep/0006.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report  [3] http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Some of your comments were resolved at the 17 March teleconference [1],  some at the 11 March teleconference [2].

No minuted discussion. Leaving as Note in section 9:             The BLINK and MARQUEE elements are not defined in any W3C            HTML specification and should not be used.      > Also, A.10.2 and  > A.10.3 can be interpreted as prohibiting BLINK and MARQUEE but they are  > vaguely enough worded that they can also be interpreted otherwise.

I don't know that having an "A" around an object is a basic  requirement for elements that take input.    a) What about forms?  b) In other user agents such as Opera, you can navigate to every     element.    I'm not sure what's being requested here.     > B.1 I would add a Pri 3 recommendation that they use Hx elements to  > distinguish structure of the document, although I recognize that it is not  > enforceable in a programmatic way.

This was discussed in [1] and [3] and the results are:    a) Checkpoint 5.1 will read:          Use header elements to convey logical structure and use           them according to specification.     b) After discussion of [3], a new checkpoint in guideline 14     should read (and refer to headings as an example):           Divide large amounts of information into            manageable groups where natural and           appropriate.      > B.1.3 FIELDSET should only be required (PRI 1) for check boxes if their  > labels don't convey enough information to make them understood on their own.  > In other cases it might be lower priority, especially if there are few  > options in a group.    During [3], we discussed creating a new checkpoint about  organizating information. Your comment about FIELDSET  is subsumed by the new checkpoint, which is priority 2.      > B.2.1 I strongly suggest that you add requirement that when link text can't  > be reasonably worded so as to be understood out of context, that TITLE be  > used to add longer names for the links that would distinguish them from each  > other. This is a very powerful technique and of much benefit to accessibilty  > aids and other tools (such as those that provide a list of the links in a  > page).    Yes. This was discussed at [1] and we decided  to word checkpoint 15.1  as follows: Clearly identify the target of each link. We will add  that "title" may be used in addition to clear link text to make  links understandable outside of context.     > C.

Yes, we can use this information - removing browser-specific  information - in the techniques document.     > Medium Priority:  >   > A.14.1 Seems like a Pri 3 to me; why is that a Pri 2?

[Priority 2]        > B.1.5 Use of OPTGROUP should be Pri 3 as it improves usability but not basic  > accessibility.    Discussed in [1].

The guidelines[5]  now say to use the "summary" attribute for this.     > A.8.3 May want to add note that it's appropriate to override the styles so  > the TH etc. don't look abnormal.    Here's the checkpoint in question in [5]          For data tables, identify headers for rows and columns. [Priority  1]              For example, in HTML, use TD to identify data              cells and TH to identify headers.     What does "abnormal" mean?     > A.9.3 I'd recommend listing a third alternative mechanism, something simpler  > like "text links".    In [5], this checkpoint (8.2) reads:     For scripts that present important information or    functionality, provide an equivalent. [Priority 1]            For example, in HTML use NOSCRIPT or a server-side           script that outputs the equivalent.      a) Would links appear within a NOSCRIPT or outside of it?   b) What would the links refer to? If it's an alternative page,      this is covered by 13.4, which is referred to from checkpoint 8.2         > A.13 I'd suggest re-ordering to put the Pri 2's ahead of the Pri 3's, lest  > people stop reading after hitting the first Pri 3.    Done.     > B.2.10 This should be the UA's job, but since it's PRI 3 I guess it can  > stand.    Agreed. The wording "until user agents ..." has been added.     > B.3.1 Seems very unrealistic.      a) This checkpoint (16.1 in [5]) currently reads):               Use language that is clear and simple,              yet appropriate for the site's content.      b) Though admittedly subjective, this was considered very important       by the WG to address cognitive disabilities.    > Other comments:  >   > B.2.8 The guidelines document violate their own rules by not providing the  > complete set of guidelines as a single HTML file.     a) Given the intentional guidelines/techniques division, I'm not sure      this comment is accurate.     b) We provide a zip archive and gzip archive, which the guidelines      do say is an appropriate option for offline browsing.

      Hello,    This morning, Jon and I discussed the current efforts of the  Working Group [1] to identify min/max values for various speech  synthesizer parameters: speech rate, pitch, gender, pitch range,  stress, and richness. Jon made the point (as he has in email [2])  that values for various parameters are usually attained through  communication between the user agent and the speech engine  (which I take to be software, hardware, or both).    Based on Jon's comments, I propose the following:     1) We do not put minimal requirements for speech parameters      in the Guidelines, but instead state how the range of values for      the parameters in question is determined. In Jon's email [2],      for example, he lists the parameters available through the SAPI      interface [3]. (Is there HTML documentation for SAPI on the Web,      or do I have to download software or a big document to read      about the interface?)         I do not have a proposal for how to express this communication,      and welcome input from those versed in speech synthesizer      technology.ww     2) We should put some example ranges in the Techniques document.      Thus, the min/max range for speech rate of 100 to 700       words/minute would be listed in Techniques, as well as any      other data people submit.     3) We refer developers also to CSS aural style sheets.     - Ian      [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0000.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0002.html  [3] http://www.microsoft.com/IIT/documentation/online.htm  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Whoops! I forgot to send these. Sorry about that!    WAI AU Teleconf  28 July 1999    Jutta Treviranus (Chair)  Dick Brown  Jan Richards  Wendy Chisholm  Gregory Rosmaita  Kynn Bartlett  Charles McCathieNavile  Ian Jacobs (Scribe)    Agenda: http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-28jul99  Doc:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990720.    1) Logical vs Physical Order       [1]     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999JulSep/0097.html      JT: Should we put something in our guidelines as well?      DB: I think so.      IJ: Use document order.      WC: Several programs may be used to generated a graphical        front end to a database application. Drag and drop        possible. There's a function that allows you to view        all controls/fields and create a tabbing order for them.        Appearance separate from document (tabbing) order.      JR: What if the user doesn't care about logical order?      JT: Difficulty is that physical order is different from        order in HTML.      WC: Often times, order is creation order. Display order may        be very different.      JT: What is logical order if not specified by author.        How to go from physical to logical order?      DB: Not clear that left-to-right mapping would always work.      JT: What about tables, e.g., that don't serialize well.      JR: Perhaps if something moved on the screen, we should        recommend that logical order be changed as well.      JT: And that author be able to specify the logical order.      IJ: Not sure there's an easy mapping in the general case        from physical order to logical order (e.g., tables).        Also, overlapping lines: what to do when they overlap?      DB: Cultural differences (localization) also important.      IJ: Is there total independence between physical position        and final document order?      JT: Yes.      JT Proposes:      a) Provide basic physical to logical mapping      b) Allow user to control logical order.          CMN: Technique: Render the content linearized.         Ask author to confirm/change order.      DB: Does this mean developers need to create        another view?      CMN: The requirement is to produce accessible        content, and that's one implication, yes.      DB: This is tricky area since involves a new prompt,        a new view, control of logical order, ...      CMN: E.g., with Publisher, you can drag text and        not change flow order. In Word, it would be        moved in logical order as well. So linear view        is not always required if logical order is        preserved during editing.      CMN: Another approach is to check that the CSS        layout flow is a straight-through flow. Checkpoint        6.1 covers checking for resulting accessibility        problems.      JT: In Tools WG, discussion of automatic validation of         WCAG.       CMN: We can incorporate info into techniques document.        No size limit. Can change later on.      JT: There's a significant list of techniques for        verification and repair.      CMN: Guideline 6 fits into this category.      RESOLVED:        -Add physical/logical mapping techniques        to Guideline 6.       -Look at work of E&R WG.      2) Proposed Introduction text.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0017.html       Action CMN: Send edited version to list. Others may send     their comments to Charles.    3) Technique Reviews       CMN: I noticed in minutes from last week [3] that some          techniques removed. I would like to re-open that          decision.       [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0038.html          JR: Techniques are ok, but why placed here (under             integrating features into overall look and feel)?            Ok to keep the techniques, but not here.          CMN: Rather than remove, add more techniques!          JT: But how does this technique fit into this section?          CMN: Putting alt into every image seemed obvious to me.          RESOLVED: Leave technique in.                  Change the emphasis from "that something happens"                  to "where it happens".           ACTION CMN: Write an introductory sentence and reword.            CMN: For other removed technique, put in a new example and leave        the old one. Demonstrating is useful. This is not        a contentious technique.          DB: Would rather have one really good example than several            medium quality.          JR: Also, null alt text is still a contentious technique.          GR: This morning in ER teleconf, Len Kasday talked of           forwarding summary of arguments to WAI CG. There needs            to be "word from above" about the alt text problem           to allow us to move one.           RESOLVED: Leave current technique, add note that will           be modified based on outcome of WAI CG decision.    /* On developer response to Guidelines */          DB: Issue: Need to ensure that developers understand that           Techniques are examples only, not required. Talked           with people this week about people doing Office 10.            They fear not being able to meet some Priority 1s.           They are intimidated. I told them better to           implement a few than none.          CMN: Similar discussions with Amaya team. There were          some very easy ones (already existing or easily          done) and others really difficult. How to prioritize?          A/AA/AAA helps in this case. But within a given          level, internal working decision about which to do.          "What do we need to do first?" I sat down          with them to work out a plan. The plan included          testing of AU Guidelines, but also real-world W3C          Team needs.    4) Review of Technique 6     Jutta proposal [4]     [4]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0051.html           GENERAL.       JT: Do we wish to mention linking in Bobby, A-prompt or other         checking and verification tools? How do we reference ER         document in development?       CMN: I'd like to refer to ER materials. If it's brief,         we should incorporate a snapshot.         JT: Not brief. It's very specific.       GR: Bobby folks came up with a bunch more information         that will make the ER materials even larger.       CMN: So probably we'll have to reference rather than include.       CMN: Will ER materials be stable published?       GR: Not yet determined. Bobby folks say that WCAG Rec         makes their work is easier, but in refining, they         open cans of worms.       CMN: It would be best for AU to be able to refer to ER        materials at stable published URI.       RESOLVED:       - Refer to ER materials (not include)       - Ask ER to create stable public reference.       IJ: I propose listing ER tools at W3C Web site,         not including in techniques (since more volatile         than techniques doc).       CHECKPOINT 6.1.        RESOLVED: Jutta's proposal for 6.1 accepted. Refer               to ER doc about checking/alerting.       CHECKPOINT 6.2.        "Allow authors to control both the nature and timing of the       correction process." s a technique.       JT: Proposed         1) Add "correction process" to 6.2, or         2) Put technique under 6.3 (assist author in correcting).       RESOLVED: Move technique to 6.3       CHECKPOINT 6.3       JT: Do we want to add: "To make correction more efficient,          the author can be given the choice to make corrections          by type of error and where appropriate to make site-wide         changes." In short: group correction process.       CMN: Important to point out "where this is the same error."       RESOLUTION: Will keep the example, but will add Charles' phrase.          CHECKPOINT 6.4       CMN: Put explanatory note in: When the tool doesn't recognize       the markup, since the author may know, allow the author to keep.       ACTION: CMN will propose text.       CHECKPOINT 6.6       JT: Should we have somewhere a checkpoint stating that          the transformation should favor accessibility?       CMN: This is tricky since close to implementation level.       JT: Only area critical for access - human knows more.         (Same as previous checkpoint).       CMN: I would be wary of changing.       ACTION Jutta: Clarify proposal. CMN suggests talking     to Harvey Bingham (who sent proposal about time of     last IG review).

I know what  logical order is (i.e., document order), but what is  rendering order? Of what? Strings only? Pixels?    > 3. Rendering graphical position and size on visual display    What does this mean exactly? There are two structure/presentation  mappings of interest, I think:    1) For a given element, what real estate on the visual display     comes from that element's rendered content?    2) For an x,y position on the screen, what element     produced that pixel. Note that not all pixels are     produced by elements - some come from style sheet-generated     content (e.g., the :before pseudo-element in CSS2).    Are both important?

If they system on which the software runs does not have a standard API,  then the standard output API requirement doesn't apply. If the tool  runs on a system where it is not possible to operate the software with  other software, the output API requirement would also not apply and  the tool could thus conform.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hello,    We discussed "point of regard" in the teleconference this week   (I don't see the minutes yet online) and I confess, I did not grasp  why it was being discussed. It was proposed as a superset of  selection + focus and I didn't see the utility.    However, the same question came to me as I have been editing  the guidelines: how do we identify what the the user is  currently "looking at/hearing/touching"? When we say the user agent  should be able to identify which cell the user "is in", what does "is  in" mean? The same applies to frames (although user agents seem to  provide a way to select a "current" frame).     "Point of regard" as you describe above is something I feel we *must*  define in this document.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      18 January 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0093.html    Minutes of previous meeting 11 January:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0083.html    Next meeting: Monday, 22 January 2001 @ 2pm ET    Present:      Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs (scribe), Mickey Quenzer,     Tim Lacy, Harvey Bingham, David Poehlman, Rich Schwerdtfeger.       Regrets: Eric Hansen, Kitch Barnicle, Jim Allan    Absent:       Charles McCathieNevile, Denis Anson, Gregory Rosmaita.    Announcements      1. Extra telecon:       Date: Monday, 22 January 2001       Time: 2:00-3:30 EST       Phone: +1-617-252-7000      2. Next User Agent face-to-face meeting in Boston        on 1-2 March 2001         TL: I'm probably not going.        IJ: Please send someone else from Microsoft.       TL: I will follow-up on this.       MQ: I doubt I can go unless I can get sponsored.    Discussion      1. Update on joint meetings at all working group meeting          JG: Only two likely: DOM WG and/or CSS WG          JG: Voice, Mobile WGs not meeting. But they are interested           in having a joint teleconference at some point.      2. Update on revisions to the 16 January working draft from IJ         IJ: Fixed conformance section.      3. Issue 324: How do developers interpret the phrase "appropriate       for a task" in checkpoint 6.2         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#324         Proposed resolution by IJ::       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0437.html         Issue: What priority of requirement to WCAG 1.0?         HB: Take PDF, in general, they may not meet a particular       level of WCAG. But if you remove some features, they might.           IJ: One problem is that we don't have a formal way to        say "this format allows conformance to WCAG". We don't have       a "format accessibility guidelines". I think that it may       be easier to say "this format does not allow WCAG-conformant       authoring" than "this format does".         HB: I have a concern about this formulation and verifiability.        The ER is developing means for making accessibility assertions       about documents and perhaps generators of those documents.         IJ: Note that 12 January WCAG 2.0 includes similar       language in checkpoint 2.1.       http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20010112.html         IJ: We could add to the document a statement about which       checkpoints are subject to interpretability (refer to        "Hurdles of User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/10/hurdles)         Resolved:          1) Adopt            http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0437         2) Add statement to docuement that some checkpoints            may be subject to interpretation.          Action IJ: Add these resolutions for issue 324.      4. Issue 327: Add requirement for support of charset expected of       each API?         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#327         Status: We resolved to add a requirement at 16 Nov face-to-face.         Proposed resolution by IJ:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0088.html         TL: Whatever the DOM requires, MSAA would also have to support.         RS: Isn't this part of using standard APIs? I think a lot of       things wouldn't work any if the API doesn't support these       encodings.         RS: I don't want to add a requirement that causes us to           go back to last call.         IJ: I don't think it does. It's part of existing API           requirements, just a special case.         TL: I don't think it does.         /* TL finds that MSAA requires UTF-16 */         Resolved:          - Adopt proposal for new API.          - Add to the Note that this is a special case             checkpoint of all API requirements in general.         Action IJ: Add this checkpoint for API support.      5. Issue 373: Checkpoint 10.5: Propose raising to Priority 1         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#373         Proposed resolution by IJ: Don't raise this priority. It's already       P1 to document all features that benefit accessibility. Therefore,       while useful, lack of documentation of the changes specifically       would not make understanding the documentation impossible.              RS: I agree with IJ's proposal. Note also that no documentation       of changes is not a problem specifically to users with        disabilities. Changes affect all users.          Resolved: Leave priority of 10.5 a Priority 2 for reasons       cited by IJ.      6. Issue 382: Checkpoint 3.2: Hard to do in many cases (e.g.,       when scripts used).         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#382         Status: I wrote the reviewer asking for more details and have not       heard back yet except that the reviewer acknowledged reception of       my request.         Proposed resolution by IJ: Since 3.2 is about animated images, not       all animated effects, scripting is not an issue. No change to the       document.         DP: I think that the issue was that the format doesn't allow       Adobe to know that an image is an animated image.          IJ: But in this case, a broader solution would meet the       requirement (e.g., turn off all images).         IJ: Recall that "animation" is supposed to be a more        general class of thing than "animated image". I think that G3        is about animated images only, but G4 is about animated effects        you can achieve through scripting, style effects, SMIL animation,        Flash.         Resolved:          - No change to checkpoint 3.2.          - Await new information from Adobe.      7. Issue 389: Conformance: Hard to test conformance in an       objective fashion.         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#389         Status: I wrote the reviewer with clarifications and asked for       comment. No response yet.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0038.html         Proposed resolution by IJ: We have reduced some of the conformance       requirements as a result of the reviewer's comments. We have       worked very hard on this conformance scheme and rejected a number       of others. If the reviewer has specific suggestions, we will       consider them.         TL: Lowney says he will respond by next Wednesday.      8. Issue 394: Checkpoint 2.1: Vague about what cannot be provided       through a source view.         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#394         Proposed resolution by IJ:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0043.html         JG: Text only?         IJ: No. Consider using "less" on a Word document. There are       cases where it may not be useful (e.g., looking at a WAV file).         TL: I think the proposal is a good one.         JG: What about streaming video/audio?          IJ: I think we can ask for a static view (i.e., it doesn't have       to change over time).         IJ: According to this requirement, user agents would have to       show JPEG data in order to conform.         DP: Once in a while, I bring up a JPEG image in Notepad to       verify that the file is not empty. There's also stuff in        WAV files like author information.         IJ: The goal is not to be able to view any old format through any       conforming UA. Clearly the UA should provide a source view for       specs that it implements. Should a UA provide a source view for       specs that it doesn't implement?  It is possible to claim       conformance for a user agent that doesn't feature a source view       in conjunction with Notepad (or less).         Proposed revision:          - Only for specs that the UA implements.          - Only for formats where text can be extracted from            the format.         JG: I like this a lot better.         Resolved: Adopt Ian's proposal with revisions.          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0043.html       Include rationale:          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0065.html     10. Issue 445: Checkpoint 1.3: What about systems that do not use       the keyboard at all, but provide accessibility solutions?         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#445         Proposed resolution by IJ: UAAG 1.0 is designed to promote       accessibility of the Web for users with many types of       disabilities. Keyboard access is considered fundamental for this.       This document is not designed to promote the accessibility of       specialized user agents. Therefore no change to our requirements.         Resolved: No change per rationale provided.     11. Issue 446: Checkpoint 6.1: Consider making the checkpoint       scalable (variable priority linked to WCAG).         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#446         Status: We have already discussed this (refer to issue 111)       and resolved to leave this a priority one checkpoint. The       rationale has been that if user agents don't implement features,       authors will never be able to use them. Therefore, UAAG 1.0 must       "lead".       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111           JG: We don't have a one-to-one mapping between WCAG and markup.           UAAG 1.0 must lead, so we require P1 for all features.         Resolved: No change per rationale provided.     12. Issue 447: Conformance by default w.r.t. configuration requirements       Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#447         Status: The reviewer's comment was that the document said that the       user agent should work by default. But since the document requires       lots of configurability to meet the different needs of users, for       which users should the document work by default? The problematic       sentence in the last call draft was "Note: User agent developers       are strongly encouraged to design software that conforms in the       default configuration." That statement has been removed from the       13 January 2001 draft because it doesn't make sense: You don't       "conform" in the default configuration. You simply conform or you       don't. Therefore, unless there are objections or other comments. I       would consider this issue resolved.         Resolved: Sentence deleted since erroneous.     13. Issue 448: Checkpoint 5.7: Is CSS read-only or read/write?       [This is checkpoint 5.9 in the 13 January 2001 draft.]         Source:       http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#448       Comment: The reviewer's comment was "Is this section referring to       viewing the page or editing the page? Why would a user need to       access the CSS when viewing a document?"         Proposed resolution by IJ: Make this requirement read-only access.       - We already require that a conforming user agent allow the user       to select and apply user style sheets (checkpoint 4.15 in 13 Jan       2001 draft). - We require that the user be able to operate the       user agent through keyboard alone. - Therefore, the user should be       able to apply user style sheets through the conforming UA's user       interface. ATs do not need to write to user style sheets through       an API. Can people suggest a scenario where the AT would need to       write to the conforming user agent's user style sheet through an       API? (e.g., screen magnifier?)         DP: The AT might take a hit if the AT can't write.       IJ: But writing possible through the conforming UA's user           interface.       RS: Current style API doesn't support writing to style sheets.           CSS API doesn't let you add a style sheet.         Action IJ: Ask Philippe Le Hegaret about this and alert the WG.         NO RESOLUTION    -------------------  Action Item Summary  -------------------    Open Action Items      1. IJ, EH, AG: Propose new definitions forterms in question       (equivalence, text element, etc.)      2.

Jonathan,    W3C recognizes the general need for less technical materials  for the general public. This applies not just to WAI but to all  of the work we do. We are looking for technical writers (although  we don't yet have the job descriptions ready) for this type of  work.    The Accessibility Notes (on SMIL, CSS, and HTML, and upcoming  on XML and SVG) are a step in this direction.     I suspect that this discussion belongs on EO, so I am adding them  to the thread.

      World Wide Web Consortium Issues XHTML Basic as a W3C Recommendation    XHTML Basic Provides the Key to Full Web Access to Mobile Devices    Contact America and Europe --      Janet Daly, <janet@w3.org>, +1.617.253.2613    Ian Jacobs, <ij@w3.org>,    +1.617.253.2613    Contact Asia --      Kazuhiro Kitagawa <kaz@w3.org>, +81.466.49.1170     Web Resources for XHTML Basic    Press Release:    http://www.w3.org/2000/12/xhtml-basic-pressrelease    Testimonials from Access Co. Ltd., Ericsson,   J-Phone East Co., Ltd., NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Openwave Systems Inc.,   Panasonic, Sun Microsystems, Inc., Toshiba Corp., and the WAP Forum:    http://www.w3.org/2000/12/xhtml-basic-testimonial    HTML Activity Overview:    http://www.w3.org/MarkUp    XHTML Basic Recommendation:    http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml-basic-20001219/      http://www.w3.org/ -- 19 December 2000 --   Continuing its mission to create one Web for all users, the World  Wide Web Consortium (W3C) today released XHTML Basic as a W3C  Recommendation. The specification reflects cross-industry  agreement on a set of markup language features that allows  authors to create rich Web content deliverable to a wide range of  devices, including mobile phones, personal digital assistants  (PDAs), pagers, and television-based Web browsers. A W3C  Recommendation indicates that a specification is stable,  contributes to Web interoperability, and has been reviewed by the  W3C Membership, who favor its adoption by the industry.      XHTML Basic Brings Both Simplicity and XML Power    In January 2000, W3C published the XHTML 1.0 Recommendation,  which combined the well-known features of HTML with the power of  XML. In another W3C specification entitled "Modularization of  XHTML", W3C's HTML Working Group describes a mechanism that  allows authors to mix and match content from well-defined subsets  of XHTML 1.0 elements and attributes. The XHTML Basic  Recommendation combines some of these XHTML modules in a manner  well-suited to mobile Web applications.    "Interoperability has always been essential to the Web," said Tim  Berners-Lee, W3C Director. "The simplicity of early versions of  HTML made interoperability easy. While XHTML 1.0 is a powerful  language, support for the full XHTML 1.0 feature set may be too  much to expect browsers on cell phones and other small devices to  handle. XHTML Basic offers the simplicity and wide  interoperability of early versions of HTML and reflects ten years  of Web experience, including advances in XML and accessibility."      XHTML Basic Delivers the Web to Mobile Devices    XHTML Basic is designed so that it may be implemented by all user  agents, including mobile devices, television-based devices, and  other small Web devices.    "The minimalist nature of the XHTML Basic document type ensures  that all Web clients, including mobile phones, PDAs, pagers,  set-top boxes, and PCs, can support a common subset of XHTML,"  said Dave Raggett, W3C Fellow and Senior Architect at Openwave  Systems Inc. "XHTML Basic provides a powerful building block for  use across increasingly diverse platforms, and can be extended  with various specialized markup such as for multimedia (SMIL),  mathematics (MathML), vector graphics (SVG), and forms (XForms)."      XHTML Basic Enjoys Wireless Industry Support, Authoring Tools    The XHTML Basic specification is the result of significant  collaborative efforts of the W3C HTML Working Group, including  participants from AOL/Netscape; CWI; Ericsson; IBM; Intel;  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.; Microsoft; Mozquito  Technologies; Openwave Systems Inc.; Philips Electronics; Quark  Inc.; and Sun Microsystems. In addition, the Working Group  integrated feedback from the W3C Mobile Access Interest Group and  the WAP Forum in an effort to ensure demonstrable functionality  in wireless devices. Many industry players support, or have plans  to support, XHTML Basic, including the WAP Forum.    Today, content developers interested in making XHTML Basic  documents can create them with W3C's own browser/editor, Amaya.      About the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C]    The W3C was created to lead the Web to its full potential by  developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure  its interoperability. It is an international industry consortium  jointly run by the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT LCS)  in the USA, the National Institute for Research in Computer  Science and Control (INRIA) in France and Keio University in  Japan. Services provided by the Consortium include: a repository  of information about the World Wide Web for developers and users,  and various prototype and sample applications to demonstrate use  of new technology. To date, over 480 organizations are Members of  the Consortium. For more information see http://www.w3.org/    ###    Testimonials:      Access Co. Ltd. | Ericsson | J-Phone East Co., Ltd. |     Openwave Systems Inc. | Panasonic | Sun Microsystems, Inc. |     Toshiba Corp. | WAP Forum     XHTML Basic is the important basis both for Wireless Internet   services and for Internet-access enabling small information   appliances such as cellular phones. Since ACCESS submitted   "Compact HTML" specification to W3C in 1998, ACCESS has been   involved in defining XHTML Basic as a micro browser   supplier. ACCESS is very pleased by the release of XHTML Basic   as a co-editor of this specification. ACCESS has released more   than 10 million copies of cHTML micro browser, especially for   NTT DoCoMo's i-mode phones. For coming 3G Wireless Internet   services, XHTML Basic will become the common and extensible   service platform for cellular phones. We plan to support XHTML   Basic in our micro browser "Compact NetFront".    -- Tomihisa Kamada, Executive Vice President and CTO,      Access Co.  Ltd.     Ericsson welcomes the release of XHTML Basic as a W3C   Recommendation. We have long felt the need for a subset of XHTML   that Web authors can write to in order to reach the maximum   range of Web clients with different capabilities; especially   including mobile phones. Furthermore, XHTML Basic brings XHTML   to mobile phones with all the benefits of XML, and without the   baggage of existing HTML features that are not served well in   constrained devices.    -- Thomas Carnehult, Strategic Product Manager, Ericsson     XHTML Basic is the core of mobile phone markup languages and   J-Phone Group is pleased to see that it has become a W3C   Recommendation. We have been deploying mobile Internet services   such as E-mail and WWW access for several years in Japan, and   believe that mobile phones will become the most familiar   Internet appliance in the ubiquitous communication society of   the future.  The standardization of mobile phone markup   languages is very important. From this perspective, J-Phone   actively supports XHTML Basic as the common language for   Internet appliances.    -- Kyoichiro Kouri, Chief Operating Officer,      J-PHONE EAST Co., Ltd. EAST     NTT DoCoMo is delighted to see the advancement of XHTML   Basic. In our almost 2 years experience of running "i-mode", we   have been a quite successful for providing mobile Internet   service. The greatest achievement of "i-mode" service is its   content development. In this context, our choice of adopting an   HTML subset as the Markup Language, was the key to maximizing   the variation and quality of contents. Therefore, we expect that   XHTML Basic would satisfy our requirement for the next step of   content description.  We strongly believe that this evolution is   vital for the continuous success of wireless Internet   applications.    -- Keiichi Enoki, Member of the Board and Managing Director,      Gateway Business Department, NTT DoCoMo, Inc.     Openwave's contribution to the development of XHTML and XHTML   Basic demonstrates our dedication to open standards, innovation,   and delivering Internet-based communications anywhere, anytime,   over any device. XHTML Basic is a significant step forward in   the development of a universal Web and the cornerstone in   expanding the potential of mobile services.    -- Bruce Martin, Vice President, Technology, Openwave Systems Inc.     Panasonic is very pleased that the XHTML Basic specification has   been approved as a W3C Proposed Recommendation. XHTML Basic will   take a very significant role as the common denominator for the   universal Web access with digital home appliances, such as   digital TV sets or cellular phones. As one of the leading   companies for digital home appliances, Panasonic highly expects   that XHTML Basic will become the foundation for a wide variety   of Web appliances.    -- Yasunori Tanaka, Manager, Digital Network Development Center,      Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.     Sun Microsystems joined the WAP Forum in June of 1999 with the   goal of motivating the convergence of the WAP protocols to those   of both the IETF and W3C. The publication of XHTML Basic as a   W3C Recommendation will surely help to solidify support in the   WAP Forum for XHTML Basic as part of WAP's next-generation   architecture requirements.    -- Bill Yeager, Senior Software Architect for Java Wireless     Solutions, Sun Microsystems     Toshiba is pleased to see that XHTML Basic has become a W3C   Recommendation. XHTML Basic will provide a base framework for   Web services delivery to various devices, including PDAs and   mobile phones. Toshiba already has many Web services for mobile   phones, providing the same service in different languages. We   believe that XHTML Basic will enable efficient and effective   development of Web services.    -- Tsutomu Kawada, Vice President of iValue Creation Company,      Toshiba Corporation     The WAP Forum applauds W3C's Recommendation of XHTML Basic. As   mobile devices continue to become fully integrated into the   world of Internet access, XHTML offers developers the   opportunity to use consistent, familiar tools to bring   compelling content to a variety of devices, including the mobile   user community. Accordingly, the WAP forum is basing its next   generation markup language specification on XHTML.    -- Scott Goldman, CEO, WAP Forum      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hi Harvey,    I'm not sure that "rewind" is meant to be strictly "rewind to the  beginning". To me "rewind" means you can rewind as much as you  want, possibly to the beginning.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I received an action item at the 14 July teleconf [1] to  propose text for Guideline 1 about the relationship between  device independent and system conventions. The issue originally  raised by Harvey [2] concerned using the mouse to input text.  Do user agents that don't provide an on-screen keyboard fail  to satisfy checkpoint 1.1 (in [3])?    To summarize the discussion of [1]:     - User agents should not all be required to implement on-screen     keyboards.   - The operating system should provide an on-screen keyboard     that may be used by any software running on the system.     Apparently lots of software exists anyway to do this.   - User agents should take input (mouse and keyboard events)     through standard system interfaces.     One proposal is to modify the wording of checkpoint 1.1 from:       Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user      agent interface are available through all supported      input devices.     to somethinge like:       Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent     interface are available through standard interfaces for     input devices supported by the operating system.     Discussion at the meeting suggested that there were only two  interfaces actually used: for pointing device and keyboard,  and that other devices ended up using those two. (This is  suggested at the MS developer site by [4], the definition of  "Event", which includes only keyboard and mouse events).    Jim Allan suggested that the term "device-independence" continue  to be used in various checkpoints and that we explain what  this is supposed to mean in the rationale of Guideline 1.    Here's a first draft for a new rationale section for Guideline 1:        Since not all users make use of the same hardware for      input or output, software must be designed to work      with the widest possible range of devices. For instance,      not all users have pointing devices, so software       must not rely on them for operation. Users must be       able to reach all functionalities offered by the user       agent interface with all input devices supported by      the underlying system.        The best way to make this possible is to design software      that follows system conventions and uses standard APIs      for user input and output.  When user agents use these       standard interfaces, assistive technologies and other software can      programmatically trigger mouse or keyboard events. For       instance, some users who may not be able to enter text easily      through a standard keyboard can still use special      devices or an on-screen keyboard to operate the user agent.        Standard interfaces make it possible for users to use      a variety of input and output devices (and to develop new ones),      including pointing devices, keyboards,        braille devices, head wands, microphones, touch      screens, speech synthesizers, and more. Using standard      interfaces also allows international users with      very different keyboards to use software. [@@this sounds      good. is it true? -editor]        Please  refer also to Guideline 12, which discusses       the importance to accessibility of following operating       system conventions.      We could also add a definition of   "device independence" to the glossary:        Device Independence:        The ability to make use of software via any input      or output device supported by the operating system.      User agents should follow system conventions and      use standard APIs for device input and output.

      Hello Working Group,    The 29 December 2000 draft of the UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]  and Techniques [2] documents are available. They incorporate  some of the resolutions from the November face-to-face meeting.    NOTE: I will be out of town from today (29 December) until   4 January 2001. I regret that I do not have time today to  update the list of changes; I will do so on my return.   I thought it was important to get a new draft to the WG anyway.    Nonetheless, please review:    - checkpoint 1.1    - checkpoint 4.3    - The new stuff on input modalities.    - The revised conformance model presentation    (There are other changes than these.)    NOTE 2: I didn't have time to really scan the document to  see whether there are any horrible errors. Please let me  know if you find any!

We will also have our regular meeting 11 May.    3) PR#271: Checkpoint 4.7: Change to P2 since arbitrary repositioning              not a requirement.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#271       MR: I posted something to list.     /* IJ Notes that nothing on the list */       MR: Refer to AG's comments:             http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0244.html        MR: I believe that the situations AG referred to are both         important.         MR: I agree with AG's comments on "undue burden" (Point 1 in his         email).       MR: For Point 2, I agree that being able to arrange components         is a P1 requirement.        MR: Geoff Freed and I are not aware of languages that don't.         allow repositioning, so "case 3" is not significant. Refer         to minutes of 25 April call for "three cases".          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0196.html       MR: If there were languages that didn't allow repositioning, then I         would still want the UA to offer this to the user.        DP: Applicability also kicks in in case three - the user agent         should do that work when it recognizes the content as          transcript, caption.       DP: Furthermore, authoring tools already let people do this.       MR: In a multitask situation (e.g., watching a video and          answering questions), you may need to obscure some content         in order to answer questions at the same time.       DP: Can we use another word than "arbitrary"?       JG: We could just talk about what specifications allow you         to do.          MR: In quicktime, you can adjust the position of the caption         window within the general region.       TL: In Windows Media Player, I can only get the caption to         appear at the bottom.       MR: I've seen SAMI demos where there is repositioning. Through         scripting. It's not in the player interface itself, but         in the feature set.        JA: SAMI uses style sheets for positioning.       Resolved:        - Checkpoint 4.7 should remain a P1. It is impossible         for some users to access content unless they can         control positioning.       IJ: Should 4.7 be rephrased in terms of what specs         support? Proposed: Add to the checkpoint that the         user should have the same flexibility as the author.       MR: Using the same positioning system of the author.       IJ: Or do we say more - if your spec doesn't including a         positioning system, still provide something.       GR: I'd rather keep it more vague rather than more specific.       IJ: Is it P1 even if the spec does not provide for         positioning?       GR: Strictly speaking, yes.        Who supports the broader scope? GR, MR, DP, JA, HB, MQ, TL       TL: Users need also to fix bad authoring in general. Also,          a case of third parties writing "skins" for content and         in doing so, may eliminate the rendering of captions.       MR: We may need to change "configure" to "reposition" since         it's not about static configuration.       Resolved:       - Change checkpoint 4.7 wording to be "change the position of..."         "Allow the user to position .... on graphical displays."       - Add a Note after 4.7 for cases where a spec         provides for positioning, the user is expected to have         the same range of positions as the author.       - In techniques, talk about the three cases (refer to         25 April minute).        HB: Should we suggest that users be able to reuse dead space,         e.g., below a television broadcast of a movie?       IJ: That sounds like a useful default.       Action MR: Confirm usage of "configure" in checkpoints to                verify that it means "static choice" appropriately                (e.g., 4.9).       MR: I propose a technique that configuration (in 4.7) should         also be possible, in addition to dynamic respositioning.       IJ: I propose that, according to MR's results, that if         most of the configure checkpoints should in fact be         adjust + save configuration, that we change the definition         to include that. Or, that we say "control and configure" when         we want both.    /* Jon leaves to get an award */    4) PR#233: Checkpoint 7.6: What does "structure" mean here?        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#233       Discussion postponed since Ian needs to complete      his action item from the last call.    /* Ian discussion of publication of document tomorrow. */    /* TL drops out */     5) PR#257: Difficult to know when a UA has conformed.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#257    5.1) Where should minimum requirements go?       MR: If normative, then in the guidelines.        IJ: I agree.     5.2) Do people prefer an appendix, or after each checkpoint?     IJ: Related to this - what's the status of the notes after         each checkpoint?     DP: I think developers would like them regrouped in one section.     GR: Other option is after each checkpoint.     IJ: Including this information in the checklist is an option.       Resolved:       - Include minimal requirement after each checkpoint in the  guidelines.         Identify clearly as normative.         - Include minimal requirement after each checkpoint in the  checklist.    5.3) Should we pursue this project for UAAG 1.0?         HB: No, I think this a three-month effort.       IJ: I also fear a time sink now, but that we will save much         time later by resolving this now.       DP: Let's give it a shot and a deadline. If we haven't identified         the minimal requirements within a certain time, we advance         anyway.       GR: Even if we don't go out with min reqs identified, we should         commit to producing them (in a timely manner).       MR: I agree with DP - give it a shot and a deadline (and GR).         My concern with GR's proposal is that if you commit publicly         to a new draft three months later, then people will ignore the         first Recommendation.       JA: I agree with DP.       MQ: I agree with DP.       MN: I agree more with HB. Should this be part of a FAQ.         No matter what we do, the document will have holes.       DP: If we do release a set of min reqs, this could make          people lazy.    5.4) Framework for review.         a) Checkpoints where the requirement is self-evident.        For example (not definitive list): 6.1, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3,       2.6, 4.6, 4.12, 2.15, 5.8, 7.2.      b) On/off checkpoints (where the requirement is self-evident).      c) Navigation: forward sequential navigation                   in general is min requirement.       GR: What about backward?      d) Checkpoints with a range of values:       d.i) Some of them can be aligned with the range offered by the OS.        GR: It might be useful to point out that some ATs only            run under 256 colors. So less might be sufficient to            meet the user's needs. UAs should not change OS settings,            which might impact ATs.       d.ii) Up to the WG to decide (mildly arbitrary).      e) As AG pointed out, don't have a criterion, but an example that       would be sufficient.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0186.html      Action IJ: Propose a grouping to the list based on this                framework.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

DP: I saw a comment from Lake that developers need to have  information     rapidly and according to needs of developer. Put the meat up front.     Tim Lacy had made the same comment at the face-to-face.       MQ: You have to know what the meat is. People's ideas differ, so     you're back to square one.       IJ: What about reorganization based on categories of developers  (e.g.,     UI v. content).       DP: If we reorganize, I like UI v. content.       No resolution.

HB: I prefer NN's solution to IE's.       DP: Don't we address this in the configuration checkpoint.       DP: What happens today in NN and IE?       HB: Netscape does scaling.       MQ: IE 5 gives you a list box with five choices.       DB: There's a button in the latest IE.       DP: NN doesn't tell you when the end of decrease occurs. It doesn't     cycle around.       MK: You also want to be able to go to the default.       MK, MQ: This sounds like a technique.       JA: You can use the mouse + wheel to scroll sizes in IE 5.       HB: There's another observation: we're magnifying without refolding.     The IE approach scales and reformats. Scroll bars appear if  necessary.       MQ: Do we want to "standardize" this?       IJ: I would say at most checkpoint Pri 3.       DP: For screen readers, it is useful to be able to shrink text size.       MQ: What if a person has large print already?       EH: When you normally increase the font size, you change text     wrapping.       HB: A screen magnifier doesn't wrap.       EH: That's what I"m thinking about.       No conclusion. Take to the list.      [16]Issue 116 (Eric Hansen issues)         [16]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0409.html       IJ: Issues 7-10 dropped based on Ian/EH telephone call.       EH#11: Closed captions to captions.       IJ: comments still coming in on that one.       Re: "Braille" or "braille".       IJ: We resolved last week "Braille".       IJ: Haptic - comments still coming in.       EH#16: "continuous equivalent track" v. "synchronized equivalent"       MK: Depends on what you want to emphasize - time-dependency or     synchronized       EH: I even have concerns about "synchronized equivalents". I think it     has some of the same problems or ambiguities. I don't think it's     necessary since we already talk about the synchronizations that we     want in the definition of caption, auditory description, and     transcripts for audio clips. I think it suffices to name what we want     rather than using an additional term.       IJ: I think the abstraction is useful conceptually.       MK: I think what we were emphasizing in the SMIL Access Note was  their     time-dependency. You can synchronize discrete equivalents as well.       EH: What does synchronization mean in the context of matching  discrete     elements with its auditory equivalent? If you have a text box with a     collated text transcript and a movie besides it, is that     synchronization?       MK: You can synchronize the beginning.       EH: In the context of the present document, I don't see any reason to     use the term "synchronized alternative" since we can identify what     we're talking about.       EH: WCAG 1.3 can be broken down into two simpler checkpoints with     explicit reference to the elements (captions, auditory descriptions,     etc) we're talking about.       EH: In short: "synchronize" is part of the definition of the     alternative, so not necessary to repeat it.       MK: I like the idea of explicitly saying what is needed.       EH: I think there needs to be some flexibility in time coordination     between components that's nto implied in the current definition of     "synchronization".       MK: We need to explore what "synchronization" means in different     situations.       Action MK: Write some comments on synchronization to the list.       IJ: Examination of checkpoint 2.5. Only one checkpoint where     "continuous eq" occurs.       Action EH: Propose new wording for 2.5       EH Issue #18       Proposed new checkpoint to meet [17]WCAG 1.3 demands for auditory     descriptions.

[18]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0430.html       MK: There is a problem - the text equivalent might not contain the     time codes. These are needed so that the text equvalent is     synchronized correctly with other audio. The author needs to put in     the time codes. This is a lacuna of the Web Content 1.3.       EH: I agree.       GR: The requirement would be applicable for UAs that support speech.       IJ: Need to amend "native" to include features of the operating     system.       Resolved: Amend "native" definition to include features provided by     the operating system.       DB: We're not requiring that UAs be able to recognize time codes.       MK: If we want equivalent of time codes, we are. It would also be     useful to be able to read the collated text transcript on its own.       EH: The requirement of full synchronization with full transcript is     not a Pri 1 requirement.       IJ: I think there are so many prerequisites towards getting this  done,     that the requirement is too watered-down.       MQ: This sounds like something people choose to implement, but it     doesn't sound like it's possible today.       MK: One thing that is possible is that, if you have text-to-speech,     you should be able to use it with the browser.       DB: My problem here is that we're requiring something of all user     agents.       EH: One suggestion was for a provision more or less stating "When W3C     produces a spec describing how to synchronize, then follow that  spec."     Something has to be in UAGL that points to this WCAG requirement.       IJ: This is covered by Guideline 6.       IJ: I don't think 1.3 necessarily maps to a UAGL requirement. I think     this is similar to "Implement tables."       GR: I think we need to talk to PF. And get a more concrete proposal.     This may be an issue that can't be resolved before PR.       IJ: Why is this different than "implement lists"?       EH: One difference is that there's an explicit requirement in WCAG. I     think clarification is required in the WCAG WG (what are we talking     about with "synchornized alternatives"). Then we need to follow     through with other W3C Guidelines.       Action EH: Refine proposal on the list.       MQ: Get Windows media people to comment on this.

This is a good point. However, we intend to address it by  improving the TR page rather than putting more links on the home page.  For instance, we'd like to allow users to search for specs by title,  author, etc. That's a pending project...       > --------  > It would be convenient for people with screenreaders to have links at the  > top jumping to the index, news, and sitemap (or whatever to call the second  > column).

There are links at the top defined by the LINK element.  Lynx renders these, for instance.

      Hello EOWG,    What is the status of publishing "How People with  Disabilities use the Web" as a W3C Note? The UAWG  is looking forward to including it as a reference  of UAAG 1.0.    Thanks for any information,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783        

      NOTE: Please continue discussion on w3c-wai-ua only. I would like  for futher discussion to take place on one list only.    Hello,    I received an action item in several different groups (CG [1], AU [2],   UA [3]) to propose a single conformance mechanism for  all three WAI Guidelines. The text of the proposal [0]  is based on the experience of the WCAG 1.0 Recommendation,  discussions since then in all of the Guidelines WGs, and review  by the WAI Team.    Please note the following excerpt, which addresses the  question of "who validates conformance claims". It says:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Claimants (or relevant assuring parties) are responsible for the   validity of a claim. As of January 2000, W3C does not act as   an assuring party, but it may do so in the future, or establish   recommendations for assuring parties.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    Feedback on this proposal is encouraged. I expect to add, in   a future version of the document, a sample claim using RDF.    Thank you,     - Ian    [0] http://www.w3.org/2000/01/11-gl-conformance  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-wai-cg/1999OctDec/0053.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0316.html  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991209    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Steven,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed the  non-editorial last call issues (447, 448) you raised;  please refer to the email source of the issues [0].    The complete second last call issues list [1] is available  online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been  incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].      NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call    draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have    been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.    Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with  the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do  not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The  Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the  disposition of comments or not. More information about the  process we are following is available in section 5.5.2 of the W3C  Process Document [3].    On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments,     - Ian    [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0341  [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    ===============================================  The UAWG agreed with you:  ===============================================    ------------------  #447: Conformance: Conformance by default w.r.t. configuration  requirements        You wrote: "The document continually referred to prefs that should    be set, but state in the beginning that the application should work    on default settings -- but what disability should the default be    defaulted to? Which doesn't seem correct does it? So, the default    install is what then?"      Comment: The confusing statement to which you referred has    been deleted from the document.    ===============================================  The UAWG answered your question:  ===============================================    ---------------------  #448: Checkpoint 5.7: Is CSS read-only or read/write?      Comment: After consultation with the DOM Working Group, there are    only limited write facilities available through the CSS module of    the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification.    Therefore, the Working Group has decided that no clarification    is necessary; the requirement is to conform to that specification.      Please note that the priority of what is now checkpoint 6.9 has    been raised from P3 to P2.    ===============================================  On your general impression re: conformance:  ===============================================      You wrote: "This document is in general too vague in the    requirements for the different user agents (browser, plug-ins,    accessibility application, content provider). In addition, there is    no clear indication as which "user agent" is responsibility for    satisfying each requirement"      Comment: The conformance requirements of the document have been    clarified since the second last call draft. However, even in the 23    October 2000 draft, the document did not assign different    requirements to different types of user agents (browser, plug-ins,    accessibility application, content provider). The document sets    forth a set of requirements that any chosen combination of software    components must meet in order to conform. This may or may not    include assistive technologies, according to the wishes of the    claimant. However, it is true that the requirements themselves are    not geared towards assistive technologies.      In summary: I hope our revised document communicates this model    more clearly.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    In the 27 August draft [1], there are two checkpoints related  to style sheets 4.9 and 4.10 (turning on/off user and author styles).    I propose adding a checkpoint to Guideline 5 that reads:    (Priority 2): Allow the user to select from among author and                user style sheets associated with a document.    This interacts with 4.9 and 4.10 because it implicitly says  "select these and turn off those."      - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990827   --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I just took a look at the UA Guidelines and I think that we  need to clearly identify which notes are examples, which are references,  which are bound to the checkpoint to clarify it (and thus have  normative weight).     -Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hi Charles,    Your suggestion sounds reasonable to me. I think part  of the challenge of writing a document is deciding what  to include (to make it easier on the reader) and what  to reference (to avoid excess content that is not definitive  anyway). I think making the document readable and usable  has a higher priority than ensuring it is 28 pages  instead of 30.      - Ian    (Your email excerpted below).

      Dear Chairs,     On behalf of the User Agent Guidelines Working Group [1], I am   pleased to announce the publication of the "User Agent   Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" Last Call Working Draft.   The document address is:           http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105    The Last Call review period will end 1 December 1999. Please  send review comments before that date to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org (archives  available at [2]).    At their 3 November 1999 teleconference [3], the User Agent Guidelines  Working Group decided to move the UA Guidelines to Last Call. By  moving to last call, the Working Group asserts that it  has met the requirement of its charter [7] "to complete the  development of user agent accessibility guidelines addressing  accessibility of graphical, voice, and text browsers, multimedia  players, and third-party assistive technologies which work in  conjunction with browsers and multimedia players."     The Working Group has also published a "Techniques Document" that   explains different ways to satisfy the requirements of the Guidelines.  Comments on this document are also welcome, although it is not  in Last Call. The Working Group does not anticipate moving  the Techniques Document to Recommendation. When and if the   Guidelines become a Recommendation, the Techniques Document will  become a W3C Note. The Techniques Document published at the  same time as the Last Call Guidelines is:           http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991105    The list of changes to the Guidelines [8] and the WG's issues  list [9] are available on the Web.    QUESTIONS AND ISSUES    In your review, please consider the following questions and issues:    1) Do you understand the Guidelines and Checkpoints or do they need     clarification?    2) Do you find the documents (Guidelines and Techniques) themselves     usable? Can you find what you are looking for?    3) Two checkpoints [numbers here] require user agents to make     available to users information about the current input     configuration (e.g., keyboard input). These checkpoints      have been assigned different priorities: Priority 1 for      user-specified configuration and Priority 2 for     author-specified configuration (e.g., access keys). The Working     Group did not reach consensus on whether these two checkpoints     should be merged into a single checkpoint, and what the priority     of such a checkpoint would be.    4) Checkpoint 6.1 (Priority 1) asks user agents to implement the      accessibility features of supported specifications.      In the Authoring Tool Guidelines Proposed Recommendation,      checkpoints that refer to     content accessibility do so by "Relative Priority". This means that     the priority of the checkpoint in the UAGL depends on how much     you wish to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines     [6]. There has been a suggestion to make 6.1 a checkpoint with     a Relative Priority rather than Priority 1. The Working Group     did not reach consensus on whether the burden of doing so     (complicating the priority definition) outweighed the benefit      of consistency among the three sets of Guidelines. Also, it is      not clear that a Priority 3 requirement in WCAG would always be      a Priority 3 requirement in UAGL (i.e., it may be more important     to implement   a feature than for the author to supply it).      Comments on the proposal to make 6.1 a Relative Priority     checkpoint are welcome.    DEPENDENCIES AND REVIEW    The Working Group thanks all who have contributed to the  Guidelines and Techniques document.

      Denis,    Basically, I don't know what "to load" means. The HTML spec  says: "The onload event occurs when the user agent finishes  loading a window or all frames within a FRAMESET." That doesn't  help me.    I am much more comfortable with the terms   "transfer" (one "T" in HTTP) or"render" (HTML + CSS), both of  which require time. I think you are correct in that the  intention of the checkpoint was more about transfer status  than rendering status. Furthermore, checkpoint 9.5 covers  the case of position within rendered content.    I therefore propose changing "loading" to "transferring"    <NEW>     9.4 When transferring content (e.g., document, image, audio, video,  etc.)                indicate what proportion of the content has been  transferred           and whether the transfer has stalled.

The point is that the information is available in  an accessible format (HTML). That it is available  also in PDF (generated from the HTML) is a convenience  for those who can make use of the printed copy. It does  not harm accessibility to provide several formats -   as long as at least one is accessible and provides  the same information.    (Indeed, in our case, the HTML format is primary,  the PDF is secondary).     - Ian     > Please see http://access.adobe.com for more info  > about what one must go through for PDF accessibility.  > I tried to get them to send their Solaris  > executable-only converter program, and they made me  > sign (and FAX!) a long contract and it took them  > several weeks to send it.  >   > Cheers,  > James Salsman  > HTML Forms Working Group, W3C  > Cisco Systems    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Matt,    Thank you for sending in your comments. For global navigation,  are you familiar with our site index? [1].    I agree, in general, with your observation that W3C should  be providing more educational materials, in addition to the  technical specifications. Up to now, we have not dedicated  too many resources to the creation of supplementary materials  for our technical specs. It's a big job, and in many cases,  WGs are strapped enough for resources that they don't include  educational materials as part of their deliverables. (There  are some exceptions, including the WAI Education and Outreach  Working Group).     Based on discussions around W3C, it looks like we should be  able to expect in the near future:   1) More technical writers on staff, to improve the quality      of the written work.   2) More emphasis on educational materials.    Please note that up to now, W3C has relied on other organizations  to product friendlier materials. For instance, I am co-editor  of the HTML 4 specification, which does include some examples,  and a mini tutorial, but is not expected to be a book on how  to organize a Web site. That's simply out of scope for our work,  which in this case is limited to the definition of HTML 4 (and  not, for example, how to configure Apache to serve HTML).      There are probably hundreds or even thousands of books   on HTML, so we have not been worried about providing   that service to the community. Instead, we have relied on  the community to provide it for us. The same goes for  translations: we simply don't have the resources to  sponsor the translation in N languages of M specifications.  Instead, we help translators where we can, and we link to  their contributions.     I sympathize with the frustration of going to a Web site  and not finding what you are looking for. If you have suggestions  for how we can improve navigation, etc., please send them here.    Now, just for fun, I decided to see how quickly (and whether) I  could have found the answer to your question.     Starting from the home page (http://www.w3.org/):    - One click to DOM home page:        http://www.w3.org/DOM/  - Since the question is about style sheets, I searched    for "style" on that page and found the DOM Level 2 Style Rec        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Style-20001113/  - Since the question is probably about CSS, I went to Chapter    2 on CSS:        http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Style-20001113/css.html    And that's where it gets hard. If you look for something specific  to foreground color, you don't find anything. And you have to read  the spec to figure out what you can do.     I'm sorry you didn't find what you are looking for. I hope we  will dedicate resources to more tutorials and similar materials  in the near future.

      Reference Document:     http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990617     I propose changing the following paragraph:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Accessible Web content is achieved by encouraging authoring tool users  ("authors") to create accessible Web content through mechanisms such as  prompts, alerts, checking and repair functions, help files and automated  tools. It is  equally important that all people can be the authors of Web content,  rather than merely recipients. It is therefore of critical importance  that the tools used to create  this content are themselves accessible. Adoption of these guidelines  will result in the proliferation of Web pages that can be read by a  broader range of readers  and in authoring tools that can be used by a broader   range of authors.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    With this one:    Authoring tools produce accessible content in several  ways: by generating accessible content automatically,  and by encouraging accessible authoring practices  through prompts, alerts, validation, and repair mechanisms.  The authoring tools themselves must be accessible so that people  with disabilities can develop Web content. Developers  who follow these guidelines will enable all authors to  produce accsessible content for the Web more easily  and more efficiently.        

      Hello again,    In addition to the published agenda, Judy Brewer  will be joining part of the call to discuss  some proposed changes to the UAGL charter [1].

Is there a reason why this (if it's  considered repair) should have more weight than other repair  features that have not been included?    I don't think that "authors will always do the wrong thing" is a  good reason to push the requirement to user agent developers. We  have a hard enough time getting specs implemented properly.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I think the minimum req  should be "somewhat less" than the max rate of some tools. But  I'm not a pro, so I don't feel too strongly about it.     -Ian        --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hello Bill,    The question of cursor positioning is out of scope  for the HTML specification and not an appropriate  question for this mailing list, which is for the  User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group.

Refer, for example, to 31 March draft [2]. Some time around there  (I could find it in minutes but it's late...) the WG decided  to move the terms to the glossary.

Opinions are welcomed.    I do not want to dismiss your concerns as unfounded. However, I think  we've narrowed the scope of the Guidelines to move forward  and  therefore have not tried to include every type of user agent as  potential conformant software. Does this narrowing of scope alleviate  some of your concerns?     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hi Tim,    Thanks for sending in these comments so quickly. My comments  below preceded by IJ:      Tim wrote:  > 0.  Undocumented Bonus Work Item:  HTTP:HEAD  [snip]      > 1.

IJ: This is a key piece of information. I spoke with Henrik (co-author  of HTTP/1.1 about this and he said that the UA should not report error  codes to the user. Instead, the server should return a message body  with any information the server manager deems important. Of course,  these pages need to be accessible. But is should not be the  responsibility to report server error codes through other mechanisms.    > 2.

Sigh.  >    > This also doesn't address the exception for streaming content, which has no  > 'size'.    IJ: So here are comments based on talking with a number of people      about this topic;    1) There's no way to be 100% sure that a transfer has stalled. For     instance, how does the UA tell the difference between a slow site     (e.g., across the ocean) on a good day and a fast site on a bad day?        I think that "interrupted" suggests that it's either interrupted by      the server or the client, and while some HTTP codes may convey that      info (500 codes?), that is different from "it's been a long time      and nothing happens". If you get a complete response from the      server, you just process it according to the HTTP spec.    2) Not all content has a known Content-Length (e.g., content generated     on the fly, streamed media, etc.). Therefore, the "proportion"      requirement is subject to applicability.    3) Since the amount of content and the rate of exchange continues to     chagne, what is an acceptable user interface for conveying that     information? When I look at the status bar and numbers change very     quickly from 0% to 100%, that is not really useful to me. It's most     useful when the transfer is slow or when there's a lot of content     being transferred and I can tell that I've got to wait a lot longer.     It's probably best for the UA developer and the user to not have     to think about special cases. The UA should always provide  information     and the user should always be able to use it as they wish and to the     best of their ability. If quickly changing numbers aren't helpful     when spoken, then that's ok since that means the page is downloading     quickly. (I don't know how ATs handle rapid changes in a status bar,     however. Comments welcome on techniques for ATs in this case.)    Proposal:    <IJ9.4>  9.4 When receiving content as the result of a request for a Web      resource, indicate the proportion of content received and       the temporal progress of the transfer.       Note: Proportion is subject to applicability since the user     agent may not receive information about the total content     size from the server. User agents may indicate temporal progress     in a number of ways, including time since information was     last received, an approximate data transfer rate, etc.   </IJ9.4>    Notes:    1) I removed the parenthetical example from the checkpoint since  the word "content" links to a definition.    2) I changed "transfer" to "receive" for the initial clause    since I think this checkpoint only applies to the UA when    receiving content.    3) The techiniques document will offer more information about     both "number of bytes" progress and "time of transfer" progress.     In particular, the techniques should warn developers that very     slow progress doesn't always imply stalled transfer.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I agree that the requirement of freezing video and animation is  covered in another checkpoint. However, the slight difference is that  "pause" suggests the ability to "restart" and the requirements of  checkpoints 3.3., 3.5, and 3.6 would simply be to stop, not to turn  back on.     > 2.

The reason that I propose to change it is that the minimal requirement  was not clear. Does this mean "don't render" or just "freeze". Thus,  in an attempt to identify the minimal requirement (which did come  up during PR review), I proposed to narrow the focus of the checkpoint.    The question remains: did the WG mean these checkpoints to be  about "not rendering at all"?     - Ian      > At 10:49 AM 6/12/00 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Jon Gunderson wrote:  > > >  > > > Ian,  > > > For some types of cognitive disabilities, people with visual impairments  > > > and some types of screen reder and magnification software my  > > > understanding  was that it was important to turn off the  > > > rendering or not allow the rendering of video.  > > > Freeze may work for many people, but may not work for  > > > all people.

      Hello,    At the 4 August teleconference [1], we completed (for now)  our discussion and attempted reduction of checkpoints in  guideline 9 of the 16 July draft [2] related to orientation.    To complete my action items related to orientation, I'd  like to summarize all related proposals and includes some  new ones here.    Note: With this proposal, I believe   the number of checkpoints is reduced by 16 with   respect to the 16 July draft. Good work Group!    A) Change Guideline 10 to read "Notify the user of document     or view changes". Guideline 10 will be about orienting the     user after dynamic changes to the browsing context. Guideline     9 will be about more static information that helps orient the     user.    B) Proposed checkpoint on natural language for Guideline 7:        Render content according to natural language changes      identified by markup. For unsupported natural languages,       notify the user of the change when configured to do so.       {This checkpoint is proposed in [5] (slightly different      wording here) and would replace 7.3 and 9.9 in [2]}      C) Proposed checkpoints for Guideline 9. Each checkpoint is followed     by a comment about its origin.    C.i) View information    9.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying       (through a standard interface where available)       the current view, selection, and focus. [Priority 1].          NOTE: Recall that a frame is one type of view.      {This was resolved in [4]. This subsumes 9.7 from [2]}    9.2 For dependent user agents. Provide the user with       information about the number of viewports. [Priority 2]       {Was 9.4 in [2]}    C.ii) Document structure    9.3 For dependent user agents. Allow the user to view a       document outline constructed from its structural       elements (e.g., from header and list elements). [Priority 2]       {Was 9.8 in [2]}    9.4 Allow the user to know whether following a link will involve a fee.     [Priority 2].        NOTE: This information may be provided through the standard user        interface provided the interface is accessible. Thus, any prompt        asking the user to confirm payment must be accessible.     {Proposed in [6]. Subsumes 9.10 and 9.11.}    C.iii) Document content    9.5 Make available information about a link that will enable the      user to decide whether to follow the link.  [Priority 3]       NOTE: Useful information includes: whether the link has already            been visited, whether it leads to a different document, and            what is the expected natural language of the link target.     {Proposed in [6], Subsumes 9.10, 9.11, 9.16, and 9.17}    9.6 Make available the dimensions of a chosen table. [Priority 3]      {9.20 in [2]}    9.7 For dependent user agents. Provide access to header       information for a table cell selected by the user. [Priority 1]      {9.21 in [2]}    9.8 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly       associated with a form control. [Priority 2]      {9.24 in [2]}    9.9 Make available information about an element's      context within a document (e.g., Nth link of M links,      Header 3.4, list item 4.5 of two lists, third table and      has dimensions RxC, row R column C for currently       selected cell, etc.).      {Proposed in [1].          Subsumes 9.10, 9.12, 9.13, 9.15, 9.19, 9.20, 9.22, 9.23 in [2].}    C.iv) Consistency    9.10 Maintain consistent user agent behavior and default        configurations between software releases. Consistency        is less important than accessibility and adoption of        system conventions. [Priority 3]      {9.25 in [2]}    D) Proposed changes for Guideline 10. Each checkpoint is followed     by a comment about its origin.    Add the following to current 10.1 - 10.5 (integrating them where   appropriate in the list):    10.6 Ensure that when the selection or focus changes, it is in        the viewport after the change. [Priority 2]        {Was 9.5 and 9.6 in [2]. Decision in [1] to merge them         since other checkpoints on view, selection, focus also merged        to new 9.1.}    10.7 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority  3]        {Was 9.14 in [2].}    10.8 Make available what portion of the document has been viewed        [Priority 3]       NOTE: What has been viewed may be considered based on focus  position,        selection position, or viewport position depending on how the        user has been browsing.      {Proposed in [1].}      NOTE: There are likely to be further reductions after we consider        Gregory's (upcoming) proposal for an all-encompassing         checkpoint about configuration (refer to action item in [1]).     - Ian    [1] 4 August minutes:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0078.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990716/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0036.html  [4] 28 July minutes:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0056.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0080.html   [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0081.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

      Hi folks,    I probably shouldn't do this, but I am curious to know whether  people think we should break UAAG 1.0 and the Techniques  documents into smaller chunks. UAAG 1.0 (not including  the appendixes) is 322k. The Techniques Document is 533k.   These are both on the long side.     It would be possible (though I haven't tried it yet to see  what kind of effort is required) to split the document(s)  into smaller pieces. We would also provide a link at  the top to a single source HTML version (essentially,  what people get today).     The W3C Process Document [1] has been organized this way.  Essentially, you only get the table of contents on the first  page (in the Process Document case, that's only 18k).    In the UAAG 1.0 case, it makes sense to split the  document into the following pieces:     a) Front page   b) Introduction   c) Guidelines   d) Conformance   e) Glossary   f) References   g) Acknowledgments    For instance, the Guidelines section (the longest) would only  be approximately 162k. The appendixes (checklists and summary)  would still have their own URIs (but are considered part of  the document package).    The navigation mechanisms of the Process Document are pretty  straightforward: you have next/previous/contents links  at the top of each section.     Obviously, this doesn't change the substance of the document,  but it may be worth exploring.

I don't think this was the indention of 2.8.    Checkpoint 2.7 says "generate repair text"  Checkpoint 2.8 says "don't generate the repair text of 2.7 unless                       I tell you"    I don't know why this is specific to images. Suppose the user  provides an auditory track and no synchronized text equivalent,  but the user agent can determine that some other html page  is a transcript of the track. Then it might give the user access  to that transcript (this is a little bit of a stretch, but not much).    I don't think that 2.8 should be limited to images. I do think  that we should fix the wording of 2.8 to avoid "author intentionally".  So we should change      "when the author has intentionally provided empty conditional  content'  to      "when the user agent recognizes that the author has     failed to provide conditional content that was      frequired by the ormat specification."    (In other words, reuse the language of 2.7).     _ Ian    > a. 2.8 was originally only about images and I am not sure the general  > conditional content substitution works for this checkpoint with any known  > results.     > b.

He  and I discussed ones that were not. Please refer to   proposals below.    1) For Comments 1 and 2, I propose to change checkpoint     2.6 as suggested by Eric. Furthermore, I propose moving      the Note into the checkpoint itself (and not mentioning     sychronized collated text transcripts since that will be     covered by this note).    <PROPOSED>  2.6 Allow the user to specify that text  transcripts, collated text transcripts, captions,  and auditory descriptions be rendered at the same  time as the associated auditory and visual  presentations. Respect synchronization cues during  rendering.  </PROPOSED>    2) Comment #6: Clarify checkpoint 2.2.       I agree with Eric that as written in the CR,     Checkpoint 2.2 is not clear:       <OLD>  "2.2 For presentations that require user   interaction within a specified time interval, allow  the user to configure the time interval (e.g., by  allowing the user to pause and restart the  presentation, to slow it down, etc.). [Priority 1]"  </OLD>      The checkpoint involves several pieces:        - Presentations        - User interaction within a time interval        - Configuration of the time interval        - The example of how the time interval is adjusted.      Checkpoints 4.5 and 4.6 require user agents to allow users    to slow, pause, stop, rewind, etc. audio, video, and    animations. If checkpoint 2.2 is only about the user being    able to control the rate of a presentation, 2.2 is subsumed    by them (since cases where user interaction is required is    a subset of all presentations). However, 2.2 talks about    configuration and this should be interpreted to mean that    the user configures the UA and *no longer has to pause or    slow the presentation by hand*. In this way, 2.2 differs from    4.5 and 4.6, and this difference needs to be clarified. Here    is the proposed clarification:      <PROPOSED 2.2>       For presentations that require user input within a        specified time interval, allow the user to configure the       time interval (e.g., to extend it or to cause the user agent       to pause the presentation and await user input before proceeding).    </PROPOSED>      3) Comment #7: Fix the introduction for Guideline 2.       I think the following paragraph should be moved to      Guideline 4 (and edited accordingly) since G4 talks     more about dynamic presentations and user interaction     than 2.2 (notably with the proposed change above that     2.2 is about configuration, not actions from the user).    > > "Access to content requires more than mode  > > redundancy.

To make the  > > presentation accessible to these users, user agents  > > rendering synchronized presentations must either  > > provide access to content in a time-independent  > > manner or allow users to configure the playback  > > rate of the presentation."    4) I also think we should add Eric's proposed definitions for     collated text transcript, transcript, audio (to distinguish     audio presentation from audio track from sounds).     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

However, the techniques doc already states in 2.10:       Fonts              Instead of using deprecated presentation elements             and attributes, use the many CSS properties to control font            characteristics: 'font-family', 'font-size',  'font-size-adjust',                 'font-stretch', 'font-style',  'font-variant', and 'font-weight'.       > Also the issue of considering the checklist to be part of the  > guidelines (a different view in fact) but still being an addressable  > document (that we can use for quick reference from WAI Home page for  > instance).     This doesn't seem like an issue to me. You can point to a chapter  of the HTML 4.0 spec, which is a different document than the  cover page.

That's what we already have. The issue is whether the "Section  A" should be "Section 1" instead. The "A" part is not longer  involved in the guideline numbering.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

      Hello,    Eric Hansen has asked for a clarification of one of the paragraphs  of the Techniques document [1] under checkpoint 2.7 (natural  language switching):    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Switching natural languages for blocks of content may be more helpful  than  switching for short phrases. In some language combinations (e.g.,  Japanese being the primary and English being the secondary or quoted  language), short foreign language phrases are often well-integrated in  the  primary language.  Dynamic switching for these short phrases may make  the content sound unnatural and possibly harder to understand.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    Eric asks what the UA should do in this case...    I thought that this came from the I18N review of the document at  last call, but I cannot find evidence to that effect. Can someone  remember where this came from? I haven't been able to track down  who sent this technique.

Conclusion:       * Take the functional perspective, not medical perspective       * Don't talk about "impairment." in the document.       * Refer also to [7]question raised by Phill about definition of         "disability"         PJ: I dont' want to delete existing definitions. Just need to add         definition of "disability" to the glossary.         GR: I find the term "disabled" perjorative.         IJ: We avoided the term in WCAG.         JT: WAI CG felt strongly about not using a medical-based         definition.         PJ: I think this applies more to WCAG to define accessibility of         content. We don't need to define it independently. Also UI         standards.         Resolved: No need to add definition of "disability" in the ATAG.

[8]Issues raised by Ian          [8]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0295.html      Issue 1) Section 1.3 (Conformance to these Guidelines).       Form 1 describes what information must be made available in a  detailed     conformance claim (AUGL version, conformance level, checklist, etc.).     In the UA WG, we have been discussing ways to deliver this  information     (this was discussed at the 10 December UAGL face-to-face in Austin     as[9] issue 136). would like the methods used by the AU Guidelines  and     UA Guidelines to be the same, even if details of the claim vary     slightly.          [9]  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#136       Proposed: In Form 1, explain that the information required for the     claim (the bulleted list) may be provided in the software     documentation or on the Web. In the latter case, the claim would be     accompanied by a URI to the claim information on the Web.       JT: Discussed yesterday in [10]WAI CG meeting.         [10]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-wai-cg/1999OctDec/0053.html       Action Ian: Propose wording that will work across all Guidelines to     all WGs.      Issue 2) Editorial change to checkpoint 2.2: change "inform" to  "alert".       Old text: "If markup generated by the tool does not conform to W3C     specifications, inform the author."       The term "alert" is well-defined, while "inform" is not. The term     "alert" is defined as "draw the author's attention to an event or     situation." Invalid markup is a situation.       JT: Alert is perceived as something that people are familiar with     (e.g,. with dialog boxes).       PJ: Propose to subsitute "alert" with "inform" globally.       DB: I don't think we should use "alert" in 2.3 due to common usage in     Windows.       Resolved:       * Define "inform" as a superset of "alert", "prompt", etc.       * Use "inform" in 2.2 and 4.1 and link to its definition.       * Link to "prompt" in note after 4.1       * Leave "alert' as is.       * Add an "s" to problems at the end of the Note in 4.1      Issue 3) Checkpoint 3.3       a) In the Note, it is not clear that "movies" are movies that come     with the tool. I propose adding the word "prepackaged" before     "movies".       Resolved:       * Add "prepackaged"       * Add more links to definitions.       b) Make "auditory descriptions" plural in the Note.       Resolved: Yse.      Issue 4) Checkpoint 3.4:       Both the checkpoint and note are unclear to me. Old text: "Do not     insert automatically generated or place-holder equivalent     alternatives."       a) The term "automatically" is redundant since "generate" in this     document means the tool created the content on its own.       b) "place-holder" is not clear to me and is not explained in the     Techniques document. I don't think it's necessary because either:       1) The tool generated the place-holder and therefore it's subsumed by     "don't generate equivalent alternatives", or       2) The tool is reusing a previously authored equivalent. In this  case,     the requirement may be "Don't reuse previously authored equivalents     without confirmation from the author."       c) The first example in the checkpoint note is unclear and should be     deleted.       Proposed new checkpoint text and note:       Checkpoint 3.4 Do not automatically generate equivalent alternatives.     Do not reuse previously authored alternatives without author     confirmation, except when the function is known with certainty.       Note: For example, prompt the user for a text equivalent of an image.     If the author has already provided a text equivalent for the same     image used in another document, offer to reuse that text and prompt     the author for confirmation. If the tool automatically generates a     "Search" icon it would be appropriate to automatically reuse the     previously authored text equivalent for that icon. Refer also to     checkpoints 3.3 and 3.5.       CMN: No, you lose the ability to reuse an equivalent when the     functionality is known with certainty.       IJ: 19 instances of "generate" without 'automatic' in the document     without 'generate'       Resolved:       * Adopt Ian's change (using "automatically generate")       * Add to end of the checkpoint "except when the function is known         with certainty".       * Review the document for the term "generate" and either substitute         "produce" (e.g., in the abstract) or "automatically generate".       * Don't add a definition of "generate" or "produce" to the  glossary.      Issue 5) Proposed edit to checkpoint 3.5       Old text: Provide a mechanism to manage alternative information for     multimedia objects, that retains and offers for editing pre-written  or     previously linked equivalent alternative information.       New text: Allow the author to manage, edit, and reuse alternative     equivalents for multimedia objects. Note: These alternative     equivalents may be packaged with the tool, written by the author,     retrieved from the Web, etc.       CMN: Change "allow" to "assist".       JR: "Allow" means "don't prevent".       CMN: We've used "assist" in 4.2 to allow the giving of clues.       Resolved:       * Provide functionality for managing, editing, and reusing         alternative equivalents for multimedia objects. Note: These         alternative equivalents may be packaged with the tool, written by         the author, retrieved from the Web, etc.      Issue 6) Checkpoint 4.5       Old text: "Allow the author to transform presentation markup that is     misused to convey structure into structural markup, and to transform     presentation markup that is stylistic into style sheets."       I don't understand "presentation markup that is stylistic". Isn't  that     what "presentation markup" means? I propose dropping "that is     stylistic".       CMN: I prefer to leave the redundancy. And define "presentation     markup.       Resolved:       * Add definitions of "structural" and "presentation" markup.

New text: "Ensure that features related to accessible authoring     practices are naturally integrated into the tool."       Resolved:       * Change "functions" to "functionality" (and "are" to "is") in 5.1       * Change "into the tool" to "into the overall look and feel of the         tool".

      Hello,    I just skimmed the 12 January 2001 draft of WCAG 2.0 [1].  The document seems to be advancing very well. I do have   a couple of comments:    1) Guideline 1 reads "Design content that can be presented      according to the needs and preferences of the user     and to the capabilities of the user agent and the device(s)."       How about:       "Design content that allows presentation according to      the user's needs and preferences, and the capabilities      of the user's environment."    2) Checkpoint 1.5: "Separate content and structure from     presentation". I've mentioned this previously: UAAG 1.0     uses the term "content" to mean "everything in the     document object". I understand that WCAG 2.0 may use     the term content with another meaning. Still, I would     encourage harmonization in the use of terms. How about     something like:          "Organize your ideas first, then design        their presentation (on screen, on paper,        as audio, as speech, etc.)."    3) Checkpoint 1.7: "Ensure that content transforms gracefully."        I think this checkpoint is so broad as to be      very problematic. For instance, must I ensure      that my HTML content transforms into plain text      gracefully if the user's user agent strips      out all markup?  How does the author decide     what is allowed to break down (markup language,      style sheets, scripts, HTTP, character encoding,      etc.)? Also, the term "gracefully" is lovely,     but maybe something more concrete could be used.       How does this checkpoint interact with checkpoint     4.2 (use markup, etc. according to specification).     If I write perfect HTML and CSS, I'm not in the     clear because checkpoint 1.7 says that I also     have to ensure that this content transforms     gracefully.          What do you do in the case of presenting an XML     document without style sheets? How does that     transform gracefully without style sheets?       I don't have a counter-proposal for this checkpoint.     I agree with the goal, but I think that it's     important to be more specific in stating     what's required of the author.    Guideline 2: "Design content that can be interacted  with according to the preferences and needs of the user."       I think that Guideline 2 and Guideline 1 statements     should be harmonized. Based on my G1 proposal:       "Design content that allows interaction according to      the user's needs and preferences.    4) Checkpoint 2.2: "Minimize content that will      interfere with the user's ability to focus."       Since in UAAG 1.0 we use the term "focus" to     refer to the thing that designates the current     focus, this might lead to confusion. Also, I     think that "minimize" and "avoid" share the     same problems that the WG has discussed.       Going way out on a limb here:       "If your content might disorient the user       (e.g., due to blinking or animations),      ensure that the user can control the      disorienting content, or provide an      alternative that will allow the user      to concentrate on the important content."    5) Checkpoint 2.3: "Give users control of mechanisms      that cause extreme changes in content."       Are the differences between 2.2 and 2.3 clear      enough to merit their separation? Or are both     about "Don't do what may disorient the user."?     I'll bet the WG chose to separate these on     purpose, and I do see some differences between them,     but I'm not clear why they need to be distinct.    6) Checkpoint 4.3: "Design assistive-technology compatible     interfaces."       "Designing interfaces" sounds like this is for user     agent developers. Should this be "use interfaces" like     checkpoint 4.2 says "use languages, APIs, and protocols"?

      15 February 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0223.html  Minutes of previous meeting 8 February 2001:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0200.html    Next meeting: 22 February     Present:      Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs (scribe), Harvey Bingham, David Poehlman,     Mickey Quenzer, Gregory Rosmaita, Tim Lacy       Absent:      Charles McCathieNevile, Kitch Barnicle, Rich Schwerdtfeger    Regrets:     Denis Anson, Eric Hansen, Jim Allan       -------------  Announcements  -------------    1.Register for User Agent face-to-face meeting in Boston on 1-2    March 2001    JG: Possible attendees: Denis, Aaron Leventhal (Netscape)    MQ: I will attend. The forms were confusing, however.    ----------  Discussion  ----------    1.Coordination of joint meetings with DOM and CSS    JG: We'll meet with DOM WG at 12 on Friday 2 March.     IJ: Please send DOM issues on this thread:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0213.html    Action IJ: Send an email about CSS issues to take to the CSS  WG. Confirm that IJ will attend CSS meeting earlier in the week to  discuss WAI issues.      2.Definition Issues:       1.Issue 359: Definition: text content (incompatible with WCAG?)       2.Issue 358: Definition: Equivalent       3.Issue 322: The definition of the word element       4.Issue 321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of                     checkpoint 2.3       5.Issue 394: Checkpoint 2.1: Vague about what cannot be provided                     through a source view    /* IJ summarizes EH, AG discussions on Guideline. Proposal     not yet available to Working Group. */    HB: One concern: Is it true that the user will always have the same  set of user agents? Do some get in the way of others? E.g., if video  were on, then the user might not hear the captions for video.    DP: My experience with captions: not readable with screen readers.    MQ: Should captions be required to be in separate viewports?    3.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse)   specific events.    Source:  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443    JG: I'm not sure that the requirement to convert author-specified  device-specific handlers was clear to reviewers. That may have  affected reviewer comments about the document.    IJ: Checkpoint 1.1 is very simple, but there may be some cases where  author-specified behaviors shouldn't be covered:     a) Event bubbling?   b) Pixel-specific behavior (e.g., server-side image maps)?    IJ: E.g., when you move focus to a link with a mouseover event handler  specificed, simulate the mouseover. {In other words, "onfocus"  triggers "onmouseover"}    DP: I recommend treating this like an HTML selection: you are informed  that you are in a selection element, and down arrow sends you to first  option.    TL: In current environment, element with a mouseover handler is just  identified to MSAA as a link. So, to get the combo box behavior, the  author would have to tell everyone it's a combo box.     GR: To avoid disorientation that DP alluded to, the UA should provide  the user with the option to pop up the menu or not.    IJ: But the UA doesn't know it's a menu. I think that we're talking  about a binary mode that, when on, converts device-independent and  keyboard-specific events into mouse-specific events.    TL: A few comments:     a) Yes, you are correct, there are JAWS users who have no idea that   links are available because JAWS doesn't tell them.     b) Handling event bubbling is very difficult.     c) I think that this issue might be better addressed at the platform   level than at the UA level. I think you should be able to tell the   system (system-wide) that you are not going to use a mouse. And in   that case, key events should be mapped to mouse events. I think that   this is a valid point.    IJ: Does focus move to a link when I use the mouse to activate it?    TL: When you move the mouse around, you don't change focus until you  click. IE walks up DOM tree up to a node that can take focus.    GR: What about zap-mouse-to-focus?    DP: What about a model where:    a) These mouse-specific events are identified.    b) The user can make a choice about what to do.    /* IJ Notes that this discussion falls nicely into the   "staged access" model presented earlier */    DP: For a popup menu, I want the ability to navigate into it,  or skip over it.    IJ: My question then is: is repair useful if the user agent  doesn't tell the user it's a popup menu (since the user agent  doesn't know; this is a script after all).    IJ: The author could have done a number of things correctly:   a) Alternative page (with all links available)   b) Device-independent handlers only (e.g., "onactivate")   c) Redundant handlers (onfocus + onmouseover)    IJ: So, the question is how much the UA can do (should do) despite  authoring limitations. I think that the UA could provide some help,  but the repair will not guarantee access in some cases (e.g., where  pixel-specific interaction expected).    TL: I think the problem is wider than HTML and Web pages. I think  a zap-mouse-to-focus utility would be a good thing. I'll ask  around here.    Action TL: Report to WG on discussions at Microsoft about keyboard  emulation.    JG: For us to move ahead, I think we need more concrete proposals  about what we are going to require. And what are techniques for  implementing these. I think that we raise this issue to a checkpoint  level requirement to highlight it.    The WG documents some possible repair requirements;     1) Navigate to active elements, including those with      explicit event handlers.      JG: I think we need to make clearer that this includes.     2) We should not require repair of author functionality that      depends on pixel information.     3) We should require repair of author functionality that      is mouse-driven, but does not depend on information conveyed         by a specific pixel. (e.g., repair by throwing onmouseover      event when onfocus occurs, onmousedown when onkeypress, etc.)     4) No repair in the case of event bubbling (explicit event      handlers only).     5) Repair behavior needs to be configurable.     6) You have to know that these behaviors are available.    JG: What about different mouse buttons?       What about on drag events?       We seem to be most interested in:       - Translating mousein/out to focus/blur       - Clicks to keyboard emulation    Action IJ: Write a proposal trying to carve out what repair  requirements we might include in the guidelines.     -------------------  Action Item Summary  -------------------    ----------------------  Completed Action Items  ----------------------    3.IJ: Send email to list asking for input on scope of checkpoint 1.1   including emulation of device specific behaviors    Source:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0193.html    Done: See action 10    5.JG: Talk to Al Gilman at the next WAI CG meeting about a joint   meeting with UA, PF, and Voice WG (or participants) to discuss    accessibility issues.

This sounds too vague. We were asked to break out checkpoints  in Guideline 5.1. Why not here?    > Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to know if a  > link (anchor) has been visited or not.    The specificity of this one strikes me when compared to the other  ones. I agree with it, but it could be part of several of  the previous checkpoint.      - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

CMN: Write techniques for 7.2.2 and 7.2.6 CMN (Navigaton of the  document         tree) deferred until publication of Note by Rich and Mark.  Status: Will         wait for new draft (expanded to include additional checkpoints in  guideline         7 of 11 June WD).            Status Done.    JG: Techniques for 7.2.2. Status: In progress.    -------------------  Guideline 8: Orientation     IJ: A lot of these seem to be techniques to me. What should       be checkpoints?     GG: I can see that it's useful to know that        you've visited the same target. Not from a particular element.         Propose changing 8.16 to talk about target, not anchor.     IJ: Some ideas:    a) Small list of really important ones?    b) Abstract topics to subsume some of the big list?     GG: Include paragraphs describing scenarios, how the user       really navigates.     MK: I agree.     JG: "Make information available about different elements."     IJ: How do you verify this?     JG: This list is long and there are a lot of Priority 3 checkpoints.       Does this convey what we want? How do we help designers        understand the problems?     RS: Techniques currently empty on this topic right now.     IJ: Maybe nothing is critical, just helpful. Put the non-obvious ones       in the Techniques document.     GG: In my opinion, there's some stuff that you absolutely need:         - Focus        - Labels associated with controls (or nearby labels).         Everything else you can fumble through.       IJ: It sounds like the element-specific stuff is really less       important.     RS: Can you describe this in terms of contextual information (where       your point of regard is)?     RS: 8.4 could be technique.     IJ: Where do we gather information about what users find important?     MK: We can get this info, but then need       to abstract it.     CMN: We want to know whether these checkpoints are the right ones?     JG: Use the IG to get this information.     RS: This stuff is more "technique for the trade" than documented       feature.     GG: I don't have too many people to look for for good "stories".     RS: - Provide a visual mechanism for identifying where the user         is operating.       IJ: I propose:        a) Have a small laundry list.       b) Get information from someone who has done usability          studies for a variety of scenarios.     MK: Studies might not exist, but send to users.       CMN: Go to Blinux users list.      JG: Warning, this may be "expert" users only.     Action CMN: Send request for info about orientation and for the users               to suggest ideas.     Action IJ: Send similar request to IG.    JG: Send to David Poehlman as well.     GG: Make distinction between dependent and independent tools:    a) Independent tool must make info available.    b) Dependent tool maintains point of regard (e.g., inside the focus).     Action GG: Explain the dependent tool point of regard idea to the              list.     HB: I think the list of checkpoints is more useful as a laundry list       than as more abstract points.     JG: So sounds like consensus that we want this type of list, but       want to make sure we have the right list.       -------------------  Guideline 10: W3C technologies.     Consensus: 10.1 and 10.2 are good.    -------------------  Guideline 11: System conventions.     Re: 11.1.     RS: Should a given player use a particular interface?     GG: If you use standard windows controls you get this        automatically.     JG: We'll provide links to accessibility guidelines from Techniques.     CMN: Send list of references to UA list.     /* About testing desktop UAs and dependent UAs */      /* Should there be a checkpoint for testing? */     IJ: What does it mean to say that a piece of software works with       another?     IJ Proposes: Do like in WCAG 1.0: Appendix on "validation". Important      enough to be in guidelines, but not list of checkpoints.     Action items deferred until next week.    Refer to Charles email about conventions:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0246.html     CMN: Proposes that 11.1/2/3 apply to all classes of user agent.     Resolved: Apply to all user agents.        

      Hello,    I've jotted down some notes about some of the issues that we've  faced in the production of UAAG 1.0, entitled "Hurdles  of User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [1]. Comments  to this list are welcome on this document, which I hope can  be used as the basis for a report after UAAG 1.0 becomes  a Recommendation about our experience. I also hope that  it proves useful as a starting point for identifying   requirements for UAAG 2.0. I hope that it prevents us  from digging up old issues that we've addressed, or at least  when we do dig them up that we don't have to start   discussions from scratch.    I don't have any schedule for editing this document. As  ideas occur to me (or are suggested by you), I may update  it, but I may not if we get busy processing review comments.    If you have suggestions for other topics that should be  covered in this document, please let me know. If the WG  decides at some point that there is consensus about what's  in this document, we can put another label on it. For now,  the status section says that it is endorsed by no one.

The original design (speaking as the original designer of ISMAP :) was that if  the client  did not/could not support maps that it would send a request to the server with  NO temporal/spatial information would would then trigger an approriate response  from the server (e.g., a menu of the choices or anything else the designer  could dream  up).  This gives the page author a lot of desirable flexibility.  For example:         <A HREF="http://webhost/smart-image-mapper"><IMG SRC="imagefile" ALT="see  menu"></A>         On a Visual UA would fetch "imagefile" and send spatial coordinates to  smart-image-mapper         On a non-Visual UA would fetch "smart-image-mapper" with no coordinate  data and display             the result in-line (if it can) otherwise it would present the ALT  text as a link which would            fetch "smart-image-mapper" with no spatial coordinate data (which is  expected to            generate an appropriate page).    It really sucks that so many image-map clients are broken and do not generate  pages for  "null" coordinates.  Perhaps we need to amend the spec to include a hint to web  browsers  about what they can expect to find, ISMAP could have an optional value:   <A HREF="xxx"><IMG SRC="..." ISMAP>  <!-- unknown, prolly  broken -->   <A HREF="xxx"><IMG SRC="..." ISMAP="link">  <!-- prefer a  link to xxx -->   <A HREF="xxx"><IMG SRC="..." ISMAP="inline"> <!-- prefer to  inline output from xxx -->        

      Hello,    In the 9 March UAAG 1.0 [1], checkpoint 9.1 reads:        9.1 Allow the user to make the selection and focus of         each viewport (including frames) the current selection        and current focus, respectively. For interfaces that         support a pointing device, allow the user to interact         with each viewport using the pointing device.    The second sentence seems out of place to me.  For one, it's not clear what "interact with each viewport"  means. Perhaps this means "you have to be able to send  pointing device events to each viewport". But unlike  the case for focus, we don't have any other requirements  tied to the pointing device once a viewport gets  pointing device input. Checkpoints 9.1 to 9.7 (and others)  all involve focus requirements.    In addition, checkpoint 1.1 covers the requirement that   the UA be operable fully through the pointing device  (when conformance is sought for the pointing device).    Therefore, I think we can delete the second sentence of  checkpoint 9.1 and leave it solely about focus.     _ Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    One reviewer of the document has noted that the document is  not designed so that the checkpoints can be read entirely  out of context.    I think this is a very good observation. And it's true:  the requirements of some checkpoints "apply" to others,  the result of an attempt to reduce redundancy in the  checkpoints.    For instance, we don't start off each checkpoint by  saying "In a device-independent manner, allow the  user to configure ....". We say this once (in checkpoint 1.1)  and thereafter 1.1 "applies" to the other checkpoints.    I propose that we add a sentence or two to the beginning  of section 2 to explain this. This text might be appropriate  after the description of the structure of a guideline. Or it  might be appropriate after the description of the structure  of a checkpoint. In any case, here's the text:    <PROPOSED>    Note: Many checkpoints in this document are "interdependent":    they include requirements that have been "factored out"     of other checkpoints in order to reduce the size of the     document. For instance, checkpoint 1.1 requires that the     user agent be fully operable through the keyboard.     Consequently, checkpoint 4.1 does not need to    state explicitly that all input device requirements of    the checkpoint must be satisfied through the keyboard;    it does not start "Allow global configuration and    control through the keyboard..."      As a result of this factorization, first-time     readers are likely to find the checkpoints easier to     understand in context than "on their own." For instance,    guideline prose, guideline organization, checkpoint order,     checkpoint notes, and associated techniques all provide    context for understanding the purpose and scope of    each checkpoint. The checklist is expected to be a useful    tool for people with some familiarity with the document     to evaluate user agents for conformance.  </PROPOSED>     - Ian    Reference document: 23 March 2001 draft:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010323/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I am not quite in agreement because you can do "content negotiation"  while seeking a single resource. Therefore, it would seem that  content is what you get back as the manifestation of a resource.    I would also say that content does not include the HTTP  entity header, for example.     This is one reason why UAAG 1.0 equates content with the   document object.     _ Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783        

      Raman,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed the  non-editorial last call issue (325) you raised;  please refer to the email source of the issues [0].    The complete second last call issues list [1] is available  online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been  incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].      NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call    draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have    been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.    Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with  the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do  not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The  Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the  disposition of comments or not. More information about the  process we are following is available in section 5.5.2 of the W3C  Process Document [3].    On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments,     - Ian    [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0216  [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    ===============================================  The UAWG agreed with you:  ===============================================    #325: Checkpoint 5.5: API notification of content change in one  viewport that causes change in another      Comment: You requested the following functional requirement:         "When user agents display content in multiple viewports --and the       user's action in one view port causes the display in other view       ports to be updated, the user agent should make such display       update notifications available through standard APIs like the       DOM/HTML event APIs."       This is covered by our checkpoint 6.5:         "6.5 Using standard APIs, provide programmatic alert of changes       to content, user interface controls, selection, content focus,       and user interface focus. [Priority 1]          Note: For instance, when user interaction in one frame causes          automatic changes to content in another, provide programmatic          alert through standard APIs.

Part of the rationale  for adopting the proposal now was that adding collated text transcripts  did not seem to be any more burdensome than the existing requirement  to support captions.

However, using the same logic applied at the teleconference     (that there is no extra burden on UAs - these are just      additional types of text equivalents), I think that      this change also makes sense and I would support it.     > ====  >   > Comment #4: Fix the definition of text transcript  >   > Importance: Essential  >   > Old:  >   > "Text transcript"  > "A text transcript is a text equivalent of audio  > information (e.g., an auditory track).

Would this be for dependent user agents only? I don't think  it's a Priority 1 since you can get at content through other means.  I think perhaps Priority 2.     My question remains on this point: what accessibility barriers  fall by being able to navigate all elements?

I guess we should ask these questions:     a) Are we talking about all user agents or dependent only?   b) Should users be able to search text hidden by style sheets?   c) Should users be able to search text in attribute values if not      rendered?    I could see search functionalities changing depending on whether  the dependent UA or browser is offering the functionality. So if the  dependent UA has access to the DOM, it could allow searching, say  on attribute values. This would surprise me from a browser, however.    > The only other major technique that I think fits here, is Denis Ansons  > proposal of move to next thing like this.    I had hoped that that proposal would be subsumed by the checkpoint  to allow users to configure search schemes.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

I just want to note that we have no requirement on the  user agent to implement a bookmarks feature. Having a P1 requirement  to provide single command access to such a feature is problematic  for me. Unless we add a P1 requirement to implement such a feature.  Most of the other bindings in the proposed list have corresponding  checkpoints (e.g., navigation of active elements).     So, I think we need to make the requirement explicit  in order to determine the appropriate priority level. I don't think  that single command access to a P2 required functionality should  be P1.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    A few moments ago, the DOM Level 2 specification became  a W3C Recommendation (press release [1]). As described in the  introduction [2], the spec consists of 14 modules. The HTML  module did not become a Recommendation and was sent back to Working  Draft  status to fix some bugs with respect to current implementations.    We will need to discuss how the UAAG 1.0 should adapt  to this development (e.g., change our requirements  to DOM Level 1 HTML, change to DOM Level 1 HTML and then  when the DOM WG sends the HTML module to Proposed Recommendation  as the Advisory Committee to approve an update of UAAG as well,   etc.)     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/11/dom-level2-pressrelease.html.en  [2]  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/introduction.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Nope, that doesn't solve the problem because   the input modality requirements apply to all checkpoints: you  don't need to put input type labels on any checkpoints because  they apply to all of them.    This is different from the content labels, which only apply  to some checkpoints (and therefore, they appear only on  certain checkpoints).     - Ian    > On Sun, 11 Mar 2001, Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   >   Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >   >  >   > I liked having the conformance section at the beginning of the document.

It should be     strengthened. (No proposal yet).    2) Checkpoint 2.1.2: Change from:       "The author must be able to change the editing view without      changing the presentational markup defined for the document      currently being edited."       To:       "Ensure that the author may adjust the document      presentation while editing without affecting the      presentation specified for publication."    3) Checkpoint 2.1.3: Change "which" to "that".    4) Checkpoint 2.1.3: Change from "Enable navigation       and editing via the structure of the document" to       "Allow the author to navigate and edit the        document based on its structure."    5) Checkpoint 2.1.5: I don't understand this checkpoint.     What does it mean to edit the structure of the      document? How does this differ from editing the     document?    6) Change first sentence of Guideline 2.2 from     "The first step towards producing content is conformance      with standard, which promotes interoperability." to      "Conformance with standards promotes interoperability       and accessibility."    7) Checkpoint 2.2.2: Change "Extensions to W3C Recs"      to "Proprietary extensions to W3C Recs".

Yes, very much so. Questions:     - Did the DOM meet your needs?

      Hello,    I've updated the second last call issues list [1] for our meeting  this week. I documented 122 issues. Some of them will challenge   us, but my impression after reading them is that the list  (while long, admittedly) is manageable.     The very good news is that this heavy review came during last  call. This is much better than if it had come at Proposed  Recommendation. This means that if we handle the comments well,  we are very likely to have many fewer issues to address later on.    I recommend the following to help us process these comments  in a timely manner:     - Please remember that we should avoid adding new requirements      at this phase.      - Closed issues should remain closed unless there is new      information to justify re-opening them.      - People can register their objections when they dissent     and the Chair decides to "move on" nevertheless. The Chair     has the right to have the WG move on despite dissent. However,     if the Chair abuses this power (which I have never seen our     fine Chair do), there are appeal paths available.

How does this work for checkpoint 1.1:        1.1 Ensure that every functionality available          through the user interface is also available          through every input API implemented by the          user agent.    This checkpoint is requiring capabilities that may not be intended  for users without any disabilitly. The user interface is meant  for users, and this checkpoint is designed for communication with  other software, which a UA may not do otherwise. The same goes  for the DOM checkpoints; this document requires an implementation  of the DOM, whether or not the UA already chose to implement the  DOM for all users.

      Hello,    The 11 June UA guidelines [1] and techniques [2] documents  are now available. The lists of changes for the guidelines  [3] and for the techniques [4] since the 31 March draft  are available on the Web.    Both documents have been restructured significantly and  are aligned with the structure and formatting of the  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.    Please note that the guidelines document now comes with  a checklist of all checkpoints, organized by theme and  priority. The checklist is available in tabular or list format.

We say "The accessibility features of a specification are   those identified as such and those that satisfy all of the   requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"  [WCAG10]."    Furthermore, color control is a requirement of this document (UAAG 1.0,  checkpoint 4.3), so I think that between UAAG 1.0, WCAG 1.0, and  what's identified as benefitting accessibility, we have covered  the question of "what are accessibility features" pretty well. As well  as we can do today, in my opinion.     - Ian    > For example, Windows settings for foreground and  > background colors are considered to be just interface features, but can make  > content difficult of impossible to access for people with visual  > limitations.  >   > Denis Anson, MS, OTR/L  > Assistant Professor  > College Misericordia  > 301 Lake St.  > Dallas, PA 18612  >   >   > -----Original Message-----  > From: w3c-wai-ua-request@w3.org [mailto:w3c-wai-ua-request@w3.org]On Behalf  > Of Hansen, Eric  > Sent: Tuesday, January 30, 2001 2:13 PM  > To: 'Ian Jacobs'; Hansen, Eric  > Cc: 'Jon Gunderson '; 'UA List (E-mail) '  > Subject: RE: Instruction and Assessment  >   > I can see what you are saying about the difference in priority.

Here's my reasoning why I think it's important to move the  source view (or similar) requirement up to the checkpoint level.  While this may seem like a new requirement, it is, in my   opinion, an old, buried requirement.    We require that all content be available through the user  interface. We have also said that, because some users may  not be able to access content when that content has  been processed according to specification   (e.g., scripts or style sheets), we require them to have  access to the raw, unprocessed content. I think that  we mean more than "a source view is probably a good idea  as a last ditch solution". I think that we have meant:  the user *must* be able to look at the source in case  of emergency.    I don't think that requiring a source view formally  is a heavy burden since all user agents I am aware  of do this anyway.      - Ian    > On Mon, 8 Jan 2001, Jon Gunderson wrote:  >   >   Charles and Ian,  >   We may be able to say something like this in Ian's proposal:  >   >   <NEW 2.1>  >   2.1 Make all content available through the user interface.  >   Provide access to the unprocessed source information in addition to other  >   views.

      Reference document:    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19990716/    Hello,    Section 3.1 of [1] talks of techniques for accessing content.  Here are some initial notes that might serve as the  basis for fleshing out this section. All comments welcome.  In particular, developers are encouraged to suggest details  about how certain tasks may be accomplished on a particular  platform.    Thank you,     - Ian    Rationale:       It is not sufficient to convert a rendering intended for      one medium into a rendering for a different medium (e.g.,      a graphical rendering to speech) since structural information      is lost. Examples: table cells, nested lists (want to know where      list item ends).        Also, serial access to content not always convenient, so      need additional mechanisms to select and receive content.    Where does content come from?      Some combination of document source, style sheets (which may    hide content or generate content), and user agent additions (which    may add contextual information or dynamic information such    as whether a link has been visited).      In addition, the user agent may want to provide "intelligent"    access to content to simplify the view or to convey models    more familiar to users than what is conveyed by the DTD alone.       What does access mean?      Access means that the user agent renders selected content.    Content includes alternative equivalents (e.g., attribute    values).  [Cross-link to sections about alternative content in HTML    specifically.]      In the simplest case, the user agent renders the document    (e.g., two-dimensional graphical layout, audio stream,     line-by-line braille stream) and the user has access to    the entire rendering.      But this is not sufficient and so the user agent must    provide navigation mechanisms that allow the user to    set the selection/focus and then request the selected content    (or information about the content - refer to another section...).      User interface issues:        How to indicate what piece of content one wants to access?       How does the user agent present the information?       How does the user configure the user agent to present            associated contextual information?      Refer to the section on navigation for different navigation    techniques (serial, direct, tree, etc.). [The section on     navigation should be part of another email. Some advance    ideas: configuration of navigation, navigating sets of    items (but not always linear, e.g., tables).]    Structured v. Unstructured selection.      Users may want to select content based on the rendering    structure alone (i.e., that amounts to selecting across    element borders).      Users may want to select content based on structure (e.g.,    a table cell).    Contextual information      In addition to providing information about content, user agents    should provide contextual information. Examples: table cell  coordinates    or header information. Or list item number within nested lists.      Contextual information includes language of content as well.      [There will probably be more to say on context, but in another  section.]

      Hello,    As per my action of the 9 June teleconference [1], the   group is invited to discuss two issues involving communication  between desktop user agents and assistive technologies raised  by a proposal from Charles [2]. This email does not include   a proposal, but is meant to continue the discussion begun   during the teleconference.    1) What requirements should there be on desktop user agents     to notify assistive technologies of changes to the document?     Some ideas:       a) Basic notification: "The document has changed"     b) Notification with information about where the change        occured.     c) What changes should be part of notification, e.g.        selection, style, etc.?     d) What about changes that were triggered by        interaction through the AT?    2) What requirements should there be      on ATs to make these changes known to the user?       a) Should the user be able to configure the AT for         the amount of notification they want?       b) What information should be made available to the user?

Not done?           IJ: See 6 December draft for editorial attempt a resolution.           MR: I would rather see something about "synchronized". Video               of sign language may be synchronized.    2) Announcements       1. RESOLVED: Telecon time change after the first of the year to meet  on        Thursdays at 1:00 EST (USA) for 90 minutes.          Action Jon: Please send to adminreq@w3.org.        2. GL WG is rechartering.     3) F2F meeting organization (15 minutes max)        a) Last call issues. Refer to list and Jon's categorization        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0637.html       b) IJ: Important issues that you want to see addressed at ftf?        (None spoken).       c) No objections to going to Proposed Rec after the holidays.        GR: We'll avoid the end of year Y2K hype!       d) Other review comments.        GR: Earl brought to the fore the issue of 508 decision-making.            Opposite opinion came up in ATAG review. In ATAG, concerns            about application of Guidelines to purchasing requirements.        e) When building ftf agenda, think about which issues hang         on interpretation of specs. Take those to PF.      Send ftf agenda items to the list.       f) It looks like we will have phone conferencing at the ftf.          Anyone here interested in calling in?        Of those present, Madeleine would.      Action Ian/Jon - publish an agenda by tomorrow morning.    4) FAQ  (for Recommendation time)     Refer to Ian's proposal.     Please think of questions for the FAQ.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0502.html    5) LC#138: "Synchronized equivalent" v. "Continuous Equivalent"/  Proposed       split of 2.5        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#138        IJ: Refer to how addressed in 6 December draft to use only         terms "captions" and "auditory descriptions"             2.7 Allow the user to specify that captions and                auditory descriptions be rendered at               the same time as the associated auditory and                visual tracks.        MR: Problem with this wording is exclusion of other types         of synchronized alternatives.       MR: We might need joint GL/UA meeting to consider EH's proposal          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0597.html       MR: People haven't done the text-to-speech synchronization yet.       Resolved: Need to coordinate meeting with GL WG.         Action Jon: Organize meeting with GL and AU (asking in particular                  Geoff Freed, Marja Koivunen, Gregg Vanderheiden,                  Wendy Chisholm, Eric Hansen).                  Propose 15 December joint meeting during UAGL call.       Action Madeleine: Send counter proposal to EH's to the list.    5) LC#171: 3.4: What does natively rendering audio mean?       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#171        DP: Since we moved the definition of "native" to include OS         features, does that mean we can remove it here?       DA: I think we meant in previous discussions that if a helper          app is doing the rendering, it's not the UA's responsibility.       IJ: Do any UAs do this natively today?       GR: If a plug-in manufacturer is reading these guidelines, mentioning         native support might help.       MR: Suppose a mainstream browser encounters a sound file. If the         browser is calling a plug in, the UA should be configurable         to not call the plug-in. Or is the plug-in monitoring content         for sound?       IJ: I agree with MR. I think the UA can control on/off of rendering         by choosing to "display" or not.         IJ: For the checkpoints related to volume (audio and speech),         if you use OS controls, then control of volume through the OS.       MR: Also, background audio doesn't mention "native" either.       DP: There seem to be a lot of things that happen where the         UA calls another. Is there a way to address these globally         in the document?        IJ: Comments on "applicability" welcome.       DP: Gregory brought up interesting point about "autoplay". Many         times an applet will let you control volume. Are we controlling         through this the browser or the UA that content has been handed         off to?        GR: The latter.        RESOLVED: (checkpoint numbers from [1]):         1) UA has the power to turn on/off rendering of audio. This          applies to 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.           Action Ian: Add clarifying Note to rationale          that UAs can turn off control of content           even if it passes content off for rendering.                 2) (Applies to 4.12 and 4.15).          Remove native from 4.12 and clarify that           control of volume is possible through OS if the UA          using those controls.         [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991206/       IJ: Refer to related discussion on "native": 173.         http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#171           http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0603.html       MR: Seems harsh if the only solution is not accessible.       DA: But if you are providing a feature, you have to make it         accessible.       JG: What if you're in X-Windows?        IJ: I don't UAs to reimplement, but if they are using a feature         to provide a functionality, it's their responsibility.         Maybe UA designers will ask for more accessibility in the  OS.              JG: So if the Mac doesn't support the use of keyboard to move         among controls in a dialog box whose problem is it?       IJ: I think the UA, but I realize that you want to use system         controls.       GR: Take the case of HPR (native support for speech). The install         is self-voicing. But if you don't have NN installed, speech         stops before that point. Is that part of this discussion?       DA: There are third-party tools for the Mac that make it         accessible. ("ClickIt" by Teletools (?))       DA: If the underlying OS is not accessible, your browser is not         accessible.       DP: But you can make it accessible through your own UI.       /* DB Joins */       DB: I think we can live with with Ian's proposal.           http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0603.html       Conclusion: More discussion on the list. Discuss this at ftf with                 IBM Team.    6) LC#135: Add incremental forward/rewind for audio, video, speech?        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#135        Resolved:        * No objections to "fast forward" to 4.10 and 4.13.       MR: I thought "incremental" meant small discrete chunks. I don't         think variable speed of fast forward and incremental advance         are the same thing. Analogy: You want the page down key to         move you in small chunks.       IJ: Does anyone feel that this is a checkpoint level requirement:         advance advance/rewind in audio/video by N seconds (P2)         where N is configurable (P3).       DP: I think P2 since without this, difficult for people with physical         disabilities.        MR: I think this is more of a technique. It's also being done  already.       Action Ian: Send proposal on this to the list.    7) .LC#139: Need clarification of 4.11 (audio playback speed)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#139        Refers to 4.11 "Allow the user to control audio playback rate."       IJ: TV's comment is that speed control for general          audio not as important as for speech.       GR: Hard for streaming. I think TV's point is that acceleration is         just a convenience. Deceleration is different. More likely         that people with learning disabilities could use slower audio.         Also some users with blindness.       JG: It's possible to slow down streaming.       MR: Do we also require adjustment for pitch?       Action Denis: Write up text to explain why deceleration is                   important for users.       Resolved:       * 4.11 is Priority 1 (Refer to Denis' action item)       * Change language of 4.11 to refer only to deceleration of audio.       * Usually Helper App or OS will be doing the rendering.    8) LC#164: Proposed change to wording of 4.8 in last call UAGL.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#164        MR: Note that 4.7 could have captions.       Resolved:          * Merge 4.7, 4.8, 4.11 and use MR's language but talk only         about deceleration.          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0539.html       * Add a note about distortion to that checkpoint.       * Merge 4.10 and 4.13 and add animation.       * Clarify that in 4.9, position means graphically.

Distinguish for what purpose? There are two element instances,  so the UA can distinguish them. How (in machine-recognizable  code) are you going to distinguish purpose? What's a use scenario?    Like others, I think that in HTML 4 our toolkit for doing interesting  things with navigation bars and other types of markup is very  limited. Once we have schemas and metadata, we can start to add  semantics. I don't think it's a good idea to depend on values  of the "title" attribute to communicate meaning to machines.     Of course, the title attribute could be used as a label for   each MAP so that, in the user interface, a user could distinguish  them and turn them on and off selectively. But then you wouldn't  want to use "Navigation bar" as title text anyway since it doesn't  say anything about the particular instance.     - Ian      >   > Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP  > Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology  > Chair, W3C WAI User Agent Working Group  > Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services  > College of Applied Life Studies  > University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign  > 1207 S.

      Hello,    The WCAG WG suggested [0] that UAAG 1.0 adopt the definition  of "assistive technology" used in US Federal regulations.   The following definition appears in Section 508 final rule [1]:      "Assistive technology.         Any item, piece of equipment, or system, whether acquired     commercially, modified, or customized, that is commonly    used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities     of individuals with disabilities."    Compare to our definition in the 23 March draft [2]:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  In the context of this document, an assistive technology is a  user agent that:      1.relies on services (such as retrieving Web resources, parsing    markup, etc.) provided by one or more other "host" user    agents. Assistive technologies communicate data and messages    with host user agents by using and monitoring APIs.      2.provides services beyond those offered by the host user    agents to meet the requirements of a users with    disabilities. Additional services include alternative    renderings (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content),    alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation    or orientation mechanisms, content transformations (e.g., to    make tables more accessible), etc.    For example, screen reader software is an assistive technology  because it relies on browsers or other software to enable Web  access, particularly for people with visual and learning    Examples of assistive technologies that are important in the  context of this document include the following:     1. screen magnifiers, which are used by people with visual   disabilities to enlarge and change colors on the screen to   improve the visual readability of rendered text and images.     2. screen readers, which are used by people who are blind or   have reading disabilities to read textual information through   synthesized speech or braille displays.     3. speech recognition software, which may be used by people who   have some physical disabilities. alternative keyboards, which   are used by people with certain physical disabilities to   simulate the keyboard.     4. alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with   certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and   button activations.    Beyond this document, assistive technologies consist of software  or hardware that has been specifically designed to assist people  with disabilities in carrying out daily activities, e.g.,  wheelchairs, reading machines, devices for grasping, text  telephones, vibrating pagers, etc.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    What if we combine the two? Start with the Section 508 definition  (and quote section 508), then "transition" into the specific  idea of assistive technology as used in this document?    Note: I will be satisfied if we make no changes to the document.     - Ian      [0] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0365.html  [1] http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010323/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      UA/GL teleconference to coordinate issues  26 August 1999    Present:    Gregg Vanderheiden  Chuck Letourneau  Wendy Chisholm  Ian Jacobs  Al Gilman  Jon Gunderson  Charles McCathieNevile  Gregory Rosmaita  Jason White  Marja Koivunen  Dean Denman (The Lighthouse, joined after 1 hour).    Next scheduled meeting of GL WG: 9 September.       Note 1: We will try to schedule a meeting for 2 September.            If we can schedule this meeting, we will invite            UA to join the GL call to discuss outstanding            issues on 9 September.      Note 2: Meetings will henceforth last 90 minutes.    Agenda [1]  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/19990826.html#agenda    ----------------------  1) Review of action items  2) Navigation bars  3) Long description media types  4) Specificity of checkpoint 1.5  5) Metadata [Not covered]  ----------------------    1) Review of action items.     (Previous minutes)     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0266.html       CL: Talked to Coodination Group about a standard set of          questions for Web development "instructors".          Judy said good idea, and falls within EO, but no         time to address this today.       JW: Two other points made as well:         a) EO has clarification of guidelines on their agenda         b) Concerns about "scope creep" for GL.       WC: Rob sent a note to GL with questions.        2) Navigation bars       JW: Al's suggestion [1] regarding a mode in which DIV/title         can be regarded as a container that can be skipped         is a valid suggestion. I do have reservations about         the use of MAP to contain navigational links. Don't         want to use this unless in a spec. Could propose to          HTML WG, but don't want to endorse without making         it part of the specification.           Furthermore, future technologies (schemas) will allow         us to do this correctly.       [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0293.html       CMN:          a) For DIV/title: It's a backwards step. It's the navigational          equivalent of using FONT everywhere to create structural          illusions.         b) For MAP: The suggestion comes directly from the HTML 4.0           specification [2]. Shows how to use MAP with straight text.          Similar situation as we were in with longdesc. We recommended          that people used d-links until longdesc was supported.           Similar with MAP: use of MAP as block-level container          is supported - it is rendered. HTML 4.01 has this.            [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html/struct/objects.html#h-13.6         c) The "skip navbar link" is a hack that is similar to          the d-link. Useful if understood by humans, but not          machine recognizable.       GV: (Scribe missed comments)       JW: About DIV - it's a container element for style sheets         and other purposes. When it does this, in an outline         reading of the document, it should appear as part of         outline.        WC: DIV with a human-readable title is a bridge to XML.         Are there other elements that need to be grouped (e.g.,         images)?       CMN: But using DIV this way takes you out of the "standard"         hierarchy. So it's like the XML approach, but it's not         XML. So use xhtml instead.        IJ:         a) For medium term: use schemas. Don't focus on HTML           but move towards xhtml + schemas.        b) For immediate: use scripts (for example).          What problem are we trying to solve?        GV:         a) We can add additional functionalities to existing           browsers (plug-ins). So don't focus only on short-term           solution.          b) What strategies apply today?        JW: I see DIV as the only short-term generic solution          for adding structure that we're looking for. I think          the long-term solutions should be schemas.          IJ (to CMN): How does DIV/title strike you in the short term?                CMN: Marginally inferior to MAP/title solution.           HTML 4.0 doesn't say explicitly that you don't            need an image. CMN notes: MAP content is rendered           by all browsers I've tested but Amaya.         IJ: HTML 4.01 language of 13.6.1 section on rendering           of block-level content of MAP is new. Since HTML 4.01           in PR now, good time to ask an AC member to add           a phrase that would be helpful to address this            issue (e.g., no image necessary, "should" render           content).         JW: Two times to render content:              a) Image map not represented in display medium.             b) No image associated with MAP element.            So I propose adding to HTML 4.01 a comment about          rendering MAP block content along the lines of          "The user agent should render MAP content, notably           when there is no associated image." (Note           use of "should".)            [Scribe note: Suppose the user were able to          configure the browser to render or not to           render block content in a MAP element. UAs would          not be able to render a document progressively          in "don't render block content"  mode since that          would imply having to wait for all images (in          fact, all content) to know whether the MAP was           associated with any of them.]         CMN: What about OBJECT element? If you want to do what         Jason suggests, do this:                <OBJECT data="image.gif">                  <MAP name="foo">                 ...block content...                </MAP>              </OBJECT>            Doing this, you get links instead of the image (if         MAP content is rendered).         GV: Are we trying to push understanding of MAP to         far? Is this just a loophole we are exploiting?         AG: HTML 4's intention was to allow authors to          specify URLs one time only.         CMN: Also to allow image maps or text links, both based          on a single element content. The spec allows this, but          doesn't say that you can do this even if you never           intended to use an image.               GV: What about case of bulleted list of links? You           wouldn't want to put that in a MAP.         CMN: Users approach these lists differently than          navbars.         JW: I'd like to separate          a) How MAP is defined          b) Technique of when it should be used for             grouping links. Author discretion enters here.          MK: There can be a lot of navbars in a document          (e.g., CNN site). Users want to be able not          just to skip, but to return to navbars.         WC: For DIV/title, if author puts information           in "title", UA can present this information to           the user.        CMN: MAP/title will allow the same thing.         JW: With appropriate wording in HTML 4.01,           I'd agree with Charles' proposal. Otherwise,           I'd opt for DIV with title.         IJ: What about scripts?         AG: Problem of Lynx, which doesn't support scripts.        CMN: Then include a "skip nav bar" in the block of           links. But this pushes the problem from one           of listening to physically tabbing through a list           of links. The "skip nav bar" approach is still           the solution here. Or use a browser with a structure           view (e.g., Amaya).         WG: So first link inside of MAP is to jump over the           others?        CMN: So this will work today (e.g., with scripts, CSS)           and tomorrow. Also, use an image map up front and           text links at the bottom.           Conclusion:       a) For today, use MAP/title. Put a link in the MAP          to skip over the others. Use CSS or scripting          to hide it. Also, put image map at the top and          text links at the bottom.            WC: Some bugs using tabindex within frames in               at least IE 5. Don't believe supported in NN 4.0          b) For tomorrow: Use MAP with semantics as written in the          spec.             JW: Ask PF WG to consider this scenario and other            structural navigation issues when considering            schemas.         Actions:          1) CMN: Raise awareness with AC Members about enhancing                accessibility in HTML 4.01.             JW: I will dissent use of MAP unless the update               is made to HTML 4.01.          2)  WC: Propose techniques based on this discussion.           JG: Does this discussion represent consensus between UA and GL?        WC: No. I will write up the GL side of this discussion, send          to GL for comments, then send to UA.        CMN: UAs should expect to find MAP if they expect to           skip blocks of links.         MK: What about getting to the central content of the page?         AG: You may find repeated MAP elements, but you won't, from           this proposal, know how to find the primary content.           There are undoubtedly refinements to be made.           3) Long description media types             See Al's proposal. [3]     [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0297.html       GV: longdesc was designed to lead to something really         accessible. Other than "why limit it if we         don't have to", what's the benefit for making         this more than text?       AG: We're trying not to make it different than a standard         URI reference, which doesn't limit to a specific         media type.       IJ: But no "type" attribute with longdesc.       GV: But putting audio at the end of longdesc         raises barriers.       AG: But to meet WCAG, you'd need an auditory         description to accompany the audio clip.       JW: I don't think it's approprite to limit content         types for longdesc in an HTML spec. I think          the WCAG should have jurisdiction.       MK: "longdesc" also used in SMIL.       GV: I'd like to register nervousness on this point.         I fear people will put content out their that         will impose too many layers before getting to         accessible content.       IJ: Drop longdesc from SMIL and use schemas.      CMN: Drop IMG entirely.      /* Chuck leaves the call */       JW: In response to Greg's concern, I'd be willing         to have non-normative language in an HTML         spec that longdesc generally points to text.       GV: Use the Techniques Doc to address the longdesc         issue.      CMN: Having text is nowhere near as good as having         full markup: Put HTML at the end of a longdesc.       GV: Why use a movie at the end of a longdesc?      CMN: E.g., instructional videos.        GV: Why not put it on the main page?       CMN: No particular way to do it. The primary version         may be images plus text. The decision of         what is main and what is secondary is up to the         author.       IJ: This sounds like a cognitive technique: put text         as primary content, video as complement.       JW: Longdesc should not designate plain text alone,         but markup.      CMN: Yes, at a minimum, refer to markup.       JW: But this should not be normative in the HTML spec.       GV: We need to talk about the purpose of longdesc:         should limit it to a description of the image, not         supplemental information about the context in which         the image occurs. Similar to using alt text just         for the purposes of a tool tip. Warning: if the         function goes beyond a description of the image,         this could lead to problems.          AG: What about content negotation? You get text         or video depending on preferences. Refer also         to CC/PP.       IJ: Distinguish        a) Function of longdesc        b) Content types.        GV: But users may not know how to adjust clients         to get different types.       WG: How used in SMIL?       MK: Every media object has it (audio, video, textstream, ...)             CMN: Working from the HTML 4.0 spec [4]         [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html/struct/objects.html#edef-IMG            WC: Conclusion - we need to get consensus on the list about what's       the intended use of "longdesc".    4) Specificity of checkpoint 1.5       1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents for          client-side image map links, provide redundant         text links for each active region of a client-side          image map.        Action IJ: Send proposal to GL list about broadening                language to refer to device-independence, not                just text.

      Hello,    Following WAI IG review [1], I have published the 16 July   version of the WAI UA Guidelines and Techniques  as the 11 August public drafts [2], [3]. The previous public  version was dated 31 March.    Please note that there is a more recent Working Group draft  available dated 9 August [4].     Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/1999JulSep/0203  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-USERAGENT-19990811  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19990811  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990809/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      26 October 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Harvey Bingham, Tim Lacy, Mickey Quenzer, Eric Hansen,   Jon Gunderson, David Poehlman, Jim Allan, Ian Jacobs,    Al Gilman    Regrets:    Kitch Barnicle, Gregory Rosmaita    Absent: Rich Schwerdtfeger, Charles McCathieNevile    Next meeting: 2 November    Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0142.html  Minutes of previous meeting 10 October:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0125.html    Announcements        1. Congratulations on publication of the last call draft.          - Reviewers should use the public review list, and          Advisory Committee review should be earlier rather          than later (at PR).          - IJ doing a Project Review for the Team on 2 November.          I will bring back to the WG any issues raised in that          meeting.        2. User Agent FTF meeting update and call for participation          IJ: Registered so far: IJ, JG, JA, GR, HB        Refer to meeting page:           http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/ua-meeting        Registration form:           http://cgi.w3.org/Register/selectUser.pl?_w3c_meetingName=WAIUANOV2000    Discussion     1.Last call update       IJ: No comments so far from reviewers.         We will need to ping reviewers in about a week.       AG: We had a meeting with the SYMM WG yesterday. Aaron Cohen         (Chair of the SYMM WG) promised to take back a message to         implementers that they need to review the document.               EH: Process question related to the SMIL spec and our own:         we had talked about having our list moderated to avoid spam.         Is that list moderated? I've sent email to that list that         didn't get through.       IJ: Two points:      - Master list should prevent most problems      - I'll be the moderator      - Systems team not done this for us yet.       AG: Write listmaster@w3.org if you have a problem,         and copy the WG Chair to alert them of the problem.       EH: I did this and it still took a few days to get posted.       Action EH: Forward information to IJ to follow up with        with systems folks.     2. Common glossary to WAI Guidelines.        JG: Discussion in WAI CG about producing a glossary.       AG: There is value in what Harvey has initiated.       HB's unified glossary:       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2000Aug/0006.html      EH: I'm interested in working on a glossary.      IJ: Me too.    3.Implementation report    IJ: Reminder that we may be able to skip CR if we can show      implementation of each requirement.    Action IJ: Publish an updated implementation report             with evident holes in it.    JG: New takers to submit implementation information/    Action JA: Submit implementation information for G4.    4. Support documents for on or around Recommendation:    IJ: One of several interesting documents for later:     - Impact matrix   - Assumptions leading to current scope.   - Obstacles we've made it past.   - Working Group's experience in getting to Rec.    4.Product evaluations    IJ: Two issues:      - Documenting support for checkpoints.   - Long term commitment to product evaluations. What are     implications? What are techniques for evaluating software     (refer to ATAG Techniques for evaluation).    4.On the Techniques document    AG: Wendy started a thread in PF about using the XML accessibility  guidelines to evaluate voice applications. There are requirements  that move from browser to server, and this affects this WG. The  legacy this WG leaves out of this cycle needs to be useful for  work that has to be done either in this WG or in the Voice WG.  (e.g., www.tellme.com, www.bevocal.com).    JG: I think that this is out of our current charter, and WAI  needs to examine where this belongs.    AG: Some of the lessons that this group has learned will  be important to helping WAI figure out which directions to take.    DP: Issues like loop-backs in menus, etc.  MQ: And being able to turn up the volume. At these sites,      the Web site itself may or may not be acccessible. These browsers      are integrating email (voice mail) and other services.    AG: WAI PF is currently the point WG on this topic. The discussion  reveals that our current documentation doesn't cover this. We need to  examine what the UA WG has been doing to get the whole picture.  For  example, consideration of discussion at Technical Plenary in February  with Voice WG is a good idea.    IJ: We will need to review and update Techniques Document before going  to Rec. Earlier review preferred. Please be prepared as we go to last  call to accept to review chunks of the document.    6.Issue #321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of checkpoint  2.3    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0085.html    JG Summarizes:   - In many cases, two chunks of content are not equivalent      symmetrically.   - Wording in the document: equivalency and equivalency target     suggests that the target has priority, and the relationship     of the alternatives is "downstream". AG has suggested that     the checkpoint should not limit the requirement to the     downstream requirement, but should be generalized to      consider a set of interchangeable alternatives.    EH: Before last call, there were proposed new wordings of  2.3 to treat the alternatives as "peers". The requirement  is to move from one peer to the other in any direction, and  have access to all peers. It's possible to have bidirectional  navigation without changing the definitions of "equivalency"  or "equivalency target". AG's other concern was about the  definition of the terms, but I think that's a separate issue.    JG: Need to consider definitions as used in other Guidelines.  We shouldn't give a different definition of a term if we  don't have to.    HB: I prefer "alternative" (as used in ATAG 1.0). These  alternatives are not reversable (information loss as you   go downstream).    AG: The terms "equivalent" and "element" are basically  content description ideas. We use "element" to talk about  something that is content in the Web. "Equivalent" is used  to describe a relationship between pieces of content. In my  opinion, these are content concepts we're trying to define  terms for. We need to have the WCAG WG participate in these  discussions about concepts behind these two words.     AG: JG used the phrase "true equivalents". This is indicative  of a consumer problem with the word "equivalent". I would say that  there are precise and rough equivalents. But the general relationship  is a peer relationship, not a one-way relationship. The language used  in ATAG conveys a peer relationship (you are "looking down" at a set  of peers).     HB: ATAG says "essentially" the same function.    AG: It's rough equivalence, but the relationship is communicated  about the elements as peers.    EH: The only aspect of the peer relationship that has poles is  the area where you are defining the audience. You can't just  say "A is equivalent to B when presented to the user" unless  you say something about the user. An image has no value to someone  who is blind. Only when there is value can you talk about about  the equivalency relationship. You can say that "an image presented  to a user who is blind conveys essentially the same function as  this image does to someone who is not blind."     AG: What is fundamental is that the function needs to be the same.  I think that whether the user has a disability is incidental to  the definition.    EH: But part of the definition involves presentation to the user.  The ability of a piece of content in a particular media type  to convey information does depend on the user's ability.    DP: I see a couple of things here:   - Beware of bias that something "abnormal" must happen in order     for some things to be accessible.   - What the current process attempts to do is to level the      playing field. When we look at symmetrical relationships     of equivalency, we are saying "these are the possible things     that can be done." I think we will benefit from defining     "rough" and "precise" relationships in this way. It's a more     accurate reflection of what really occurs. And it will help     in the definition of defining more accessible Web content.    EH: When I say, for example, that a text equivalent needs to  be available in three modes to respective disability audiences,  this does not mean limiting access to a person with a disability.  We are committed to making all content available to all users.  All we're doing in the definition of text element is defining  attributes of understandability. The definitions outline  a set of minimal standards for the accessibility of text elements;  they do not mean (or say) that access may be possible otherwise.  It would be useful for a user to be able to configure the UA  for a particular disability profile (e.g., as one result  to present a text equivalent at the top of a list of peers).    JG: I've heard a suggestion that this is a WCAG issue. If so,  what does this WG do with the current definitions? (And how  does this relate to the glossary issue?)    DP: To speak to the issue of what alternatives do what?   Alternatives are used by many people for many reasons  (e.g., to cut costs), not only related to a disability.    AG: I think we should not close this issue without consulting  the WCAG WG.     AG: I "groove" on what EH said about policy: that is what we want to  capture and make 2.3 communicate. I think the idea that's in the WCAG  1.0 (perhaps a little slippery): they are trying to tell the author  what the author has to do, given that the author doesn't know about  the characteristics of the user. The word "equivalent" is used to  capture the fact that some alternatives may not work, but when they  work, they deliver roughly the same message. That's why they are  substitutable. You create a set of alternatives when some of the  content types are "risky" for some users. The UA needs to allow the  user to pick the one that's best for them. I believe that in   WCAG 1.0, where they are talking about using the word "equivalent",  they are talking about the fact that the information in the data  is delivering roughly the same function. The author has to look  at this as a random process (the author won't know which one will  work). They must provide alternatives, the UA's job is not  to pick and choose, but export that job to the user. Profiles  help the user make choices. UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 2.3 is about  those choices.    IJ Summarizing:     - UA needs to allow the user to choose from alternatives.   - Equivalency relationship should be described in the more     general framework of "rough equivalency".    - Checkpoint 2.3 should use the more general formulation, not      one-way.   - The term "equivalent" itself is ok to use in this context     (even if it doesn't mean mathematical equivalence).    EH: Refer to my most recent proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0153.html    EH: Maybe we can use a different term that captures what AG is      getting at: "peer for content". E.g., "A peer is content that,      under some circumstances, can serve essentially the same function      for some other content." An equivalent and its equivalency      target are peers for each other.    IJ: What's the difference between "peer" and "equivalent" at this      point?    EH: The definition of peer doesn't involve users. It says nothing      about the disability status of users receiving the content.     HB: What about "substitute" or "alternative"?    IJ: The discussion seems to have moved away from symmetry towards  user abilities in the definition.    JG: In our document, we clearly have a requirement in 2.3  to choose.     AG: Is there risk that we might not get feedback by the 13th.    AG Proposed:    - IJ and EH seem to think that we could come up with a change     to 2.3 that would make people happy. That would close     this issue within this WG.     - Ask the two chairs (of UAAG and WCAG) see if there is     compability. If necessary, take to WCAG for a timely      reply (by the 13th).    Action IJ and EH: Propose new language for 2.3.    EH: What will the questions be? In 2.3, have alternatives be peers.      AG: I would like the language used to include the peer case.          I want to avoid implying that there's always an A/B polarity.          I want to include the case where everyone would agree          that the relationship is symmetrical.

The issue: Does "natural languages" include writing systems  (scripts)? Should the checkpoint be clarified by pointing  this out?

IJ: I'm not sure your proposal is necessary: It seems to  say: "allow configuration not to render in modality X when   you don't support modality X." We are saying: whatever  modality you do support, allow configuration not to render  garbage (related to unsupported natural languages)   in that modality. We don't make requirements that a particular  modality be supported (though at least one must be  supported; refer to the section on content type labels).     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    In the User Agent Working Group, we're talking what user agents can  do to help users navigate, including making navigation mechanisms   readily available. I am charged with an action to propose a technique  for the Web Content Techniques: use MAP to create navigation bars/group  related links.    In the 5 May Techniques document, section 4.6.1 ("Grouping and  bypassing links") [1], an example shows <P class="nav">. Should  use the following markup instead?    <MAP name="map1">     <P>Navigate the site:        <A href=".." shape="rect"   coords="..">Access Guide</a> |        <A href=".." shape="rect"   coords="..">Go</A>           |        <A href=".." shape="circle" coords="..">Search</A>       |        <A href=".." shape="poly"   coords="..">Top Ten</A>  </MAP>    User agents may assume that the MAP element is used to create  navigation mechanisms (whether image maps or more accessible  ones with rich content).     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#group-bypass      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

I would prefer that we not recommend that multimedia authors feel free to use the same text file for both captions and subtitles, but I could be persuaded that, rather than recommending that authors always provide two separate caption and subtitle files, a single *caption* file should be created and used for both purposes.

For clarification, I propose changing the checkpoint to read:        Allow the user to configure the user agent through             profiles.    And then to define profile as follows:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  A "profile" is a named and persistent representation  of user preferences that may be used to configure a   user agent. On systems with distinct user accounts,   profiles enable users to reconfigure software quickly  when they log on. Profiles may be shared with other   users. Platform-independent profiles are useful for  those who work in different environments (with the same  user agent).  </BLOCKQUOTE>    The current text is:          Allow the user to configure the user agent in named        profiles that may be shared on systems with distinct        user accounts.    1) I think calling them "named" profiles is unnecessary if     having a name is part of the definition (I feel like Eric Hansen     here! <grin>).    2) I find the second half of the requirement confusing. What does     is mean to require the user agent to allow sharing? I think     it makes more sense if the definition explains the rationale     behind profiles.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

That is likely true: you could satisfy all but one of the Priority 1  checkpoints and you would be close to being a Level A user agent.  But you wouldn't be Level A. The Working Group decided for a number  of reasons (and after many discussions, refer to summary [3]) to  maintain  three discrete conformance levels.

Interesting question: what if you built a really really accessible  tool that did not communicate any information to other tools?  I suspect that the answer would still be that the tool, while useful,  would not be accessible to those who needed to tailor the information  to their particular needs, output devices, etc.    >  In  > fact I strongly suspect that it might be actually _NECESSARY_ to violate  > some checkpoints to make an excellent universally usable web agent.

Please expand on this. What would it men to meet the functionality  but not fulfill the checkpoint?

Yes. I propose the following editorial clarification:         For identified but unsupported natural languages,       allow the user to request notification        of language changes.         Note. The user should be able to request               no notification of language changes.    > Note: Upon writing this comment, I also became aware of the  > following: In particular for many forms of visual rendering  > (in contrast to text-to-speach conversion), there is no  > difference in rendering between various languages (exceptions  > are hyphenation and high-quality microtypography issues).  > In such contexts, offering the ability to switch on a notification  > does not make sense.

This should be clarified.    Given that request, perhaps it makes more sense to clarify  your above point about supported languages by adding a note to  2.3 such as:       Note. A user agent may not support all languages. When          a user agent supports a language identified by a           multipart identifier (e.g., "en-us"), the user agent           must indicate in its conformance claim which language           it claims to support (e.g., "en" alone, "en-us" alone,           or both).    Please let me know if the above note make sense and whether it:      a) Uses the appropriate terminology    b) Could use a better example than "en" and "en-us".     > Definition Insertion Point says: A viewport has at most one  > insertion point.

I propose the following changes to the defn of insertion point:      1) A viewport has at most one <INS>logical</INS> insertion point.    2) Add this note to the end of the paragraph:           Graphical user agents that render bidirectional text         may render the insertion point at two locations on           the screen. Often, the cursor is shown as split into          an upper half and a lower half.     > Note: On repeated reading, I found a similar problem in  > the definition of Selection: A viewport has at most one  > user selection.

I prefer the latter and propose the following parenthetical  addition to the section on selection:      A viewport has at most one user selection   (though the selection may be rendered graphically     as discontinuous text fragments).    > We also discussed Checkpoints 10.1 and 10.2.

[Priority  1]         Note: Important special case of Checkpoint 5.a and that the timing     efficiency of exchanging information through the exported interface  is very     important.     </BLOCKQUOTE>       PLH: DOM Level 2 core is same as DOM Level 1, plus namespaces. DOM          Level 2 HTML is same as DOM Level 1 HTML.       GG: I think a perfect example of this is MSAA available in IE 4.01.         You could get at the data if you had a whole lot of time. I         think that timeliness should be Priority 1.       RS: I think we want the same performance as for a scripting         language.       CMN: You need to know about events in a timely manner, and perhaps         be able to react (and stop) the results of events.       IJ: I have problems with a requirement that something be "fast".         That may vary according to processor, network, operating         system, interface, user ability, ...        RS: Since we're isolating the DOM as part of the UA, can we say     that the AT should be able to access the DOM at the same performance     level as the UA itself.        DA: You want "equivalence" of access.       HR: I don't think we need equivalent, just sufficient.       DA: I think that a lot of people with disabilities would argue that     anything less than equivalence doesn't suffice.       PLH: When you rely on your own structure, you can access faster     than what you can do through the DOM. So I don't think that you can     guarantee "equivalent" access. It may be implemented as a proxy.       IJ: What are the functional disadvantages by not having fast     access?       GG: You lose responsiveness, but that's not functional.       DA: Consider two people doing research - a person who is     able-bodied might be twice as productive as someone who is using an      AT.       CMN: If the AT doesn't have enough access, the page will change     before the user has read it. For example, caused by timers on     scripts.       IJ: We have a requirement to allow users to turn off dynamic     changes.       DP: But sometimes you need to have content changes to remain     oriented, and if the AT doesn't keep up, you've lost your     orientation.       PLH: Maybe you're looking for atomic interactions. In a SMIL     document, you want to change the "begin" attribute but not the     "end" attribute. The implementation may change the end attribute.     There are two operations and you want only one.         PLH: An API offered by the UA will never be as fast as the UA's     internal calls.       GG: Yes, but this is must better than cross-process calls.        IJ: Something like "The UA must allow access as though the AT were     running in the same process."       CMN: The AT has to be able to control the processing of any changes.       IJ: This is better to me since it doesn't refer to "speed".       JG: Two separate timing issues have come up:        - It's slow to get at content.        - I need to be able to keep up with changes.       GG: I think these are intimately related.        RS: The DOM (2) allows you to have filtering. If we stay with  something         about equivalence performance level, then filtering of events         would do the same thing.       IJ: I really hesitate to go into the world of handshaking and     protocols.       DA: The bottom line: can the user of an AT be as productive?       IJ: Speed is not part of our priority definition. Slow access still          means that it's not Priority 1.       MN: I think that this is a high priority issue. I'm mulling over     RS's expression of the problem. An in-process DLL will get content     faster than a script. I think we should use technologies that are     already available to us.        JG: A reference implementation may be useful to people (to show     what's reasonable performance).       MN: Other applications are addressing this problem as well. It just      needs to be implemented. Developers keep in the front of their     minds to do things quickly.       CMN: There's an orthogonal break between how it's being implemented      and what we specify. If it's implemented, that's great, but how do      we specify the requirement in the first place (so that it may be     verified).       MN: The idea being as quick as scripting we can relate to and it's     do-able.        HR: I think that timing is important. When I'm using the DOM, the     most important thing is to be in sync with the user agent. The key     word is "synchronized" with events generated by the user agent.       RS: You could put something in sync and slow the whole application     down.         HR: Having the events in sync is only part of the solution. This is      the part we can identify more clearly. Performance is the real     issue.       IJ: What about "The UA has to provide programmatic access to     content in a way that allows comparable performance to AT users."       CMN: I don't think that's adequate.       HR: In-process communication is not really developed for the Mac.       RS: What if we say "For multitasking environments, the AT needs to     run in the same process space as the UA for access to the DOM."       DP: The AT needs to do some processing once it's hooked in to the UA.        DA: In David and Charles' proposal, the AT slows down the UA. I     think that we should be considering how to go as fast, not to slow  down.         DP: The hook needs to be early in the processing.       IJ: Scope of the problem is dynamic changes to document.       RS: Not always: and AT may only deal with part of the document.       GG: Sometimes, you need to get a lot of calls to get summary         information.       MN: Static pages may be so large, there's an issue of getting         information, period.       CMN: I think that there are two issues: (a) dynamically changing  pages         (b) how to do you deal with a big fat monstrous document. The         Pri 1 content is only when you can't get at the information at         all.       IJ: Isn't rendering orders of magnitudes slower than exchange? Is     there really an issue for static documents?       GG: If you want a list of all the links, you may have to wait 20         seconds for all the content to download.       CMN: But you still have that today for downloads (e.g., the long W3C     list of 400 Members).       CMN: I think we need a requirement for at least dynamic content.       CMN: I'm not saying that static is not important. The piece that's     critical is when content changes before you get at it. When the     content is steady, you need to get at it in a reasonable amount of  time.        The best techniques may satisfy both requirements. But we should  distinguish     the cases.       DA: I would agree with CMN that dynamic is P1 and static is P2.       IJ: How about a requirement that the exchange of information take         place on the same time scale as event changes.       JG: I still propose that we delete 5.5 and make the requirement in         a note after each programmatic exchange checkpoint.       GG: I think that the dynamic case is just as important as the          static case (for different reasons).       RS: Treating them separately confuses me.       CMN: We want the AT user to be able to have the lock so that the          user can stop the chain of events if necessary.       DB: Is there any place else where "timely manner" is defined?

      Hello,    In the 23 March draft [1], checkpoints 9.3, 9.5, and 9.6 are  about "device-independent activation of event-handlers". The  checkpoints state, for example, that the user agent must   "allow the user to activate any explicitly associated event   handler though keyboard alone".     I am concerned that since the conformance model says, in effect,  that "you don't have to do things related to the pointing  device unless you claim conformance for the pointing device",  that the verbiage "any event handler" may not be strong enough.  I think we need to clarify that for checkpoints 9.3, 9.5, and  9.6 that we really do mean "any" event handler, even if the  user agent only conforms for the keyboard. These checkpoints  are "only for the keyboard" (in the default conformance scenario)  in that we only require activation through the keyboard.    Proposal:    1) (Based on Jon Gunderson comment) Move checkpoints 9.3, 9.5,     and 9.6 to Guideline 1 since they are about device-independence.     I hesitate to move them out of context since 9.1-9.7 make sense     as a group. But moving three of seven seems ok to me.    2) Add the following Note to one or more of the checkpoints:       Note: "Any event handler" includes handlers for input     devices for which the user agent does not conform. For     example, the user agent must allow the user to use     the keyboard to activate an event handler for the pointing      device, even if the user agent does not conform for the      pointing device.    Comment:     - I don't think this reasoning applies checkpoints that are     not explicitly about device independence. For instance,      checkpoint 7.4 (follow operating environment conventions      to indicate the input configuration) does not, in my opinion,     require the same type of clarification. The user agent only     has to satisfy it for the keyboard when conforming only for     the keyboard.       - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010323/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Chris, Martin,    The UAWG would like your input on a question of visual text  rendering and internationalization. Checkpoint 4.1 of the 9 April  2001 draft [1] starts:      "4.1 Allow global configuration and control over the reference          size of rendered text ..."    This is a Priority 1 checkpoint. One reviewer pointed out that it  is not really a P1 requirement to allow the user to choose very  small text sizes. Indeed, the intention of this checkpoint is  primarily to allow users with low vision to increase text  size. [I would note here that small text is useful to some users  (e.g., so that users with screen readers can scroll less), but  that's not a P1 requirement.]    At our teleconference yesterday we asked ourselves whether we  could come up with some lower bound on the requirement. Thus,  user agents would not be required to provide access to very   small text size as part of meeting this checkpoint (or,  for example, they might allow configuration, but not  actually be required to render very small text).    Our questions are thus:     - How might we express a lower bound in text size?      What units would we use? What parameter to measure     size (x-height? aspect ratio?)?     - What internationalization issues enter into this     discussion? Does a lower bound requirement      make sense across different scripts?    Thank you for your help on this topic,     - Ian    Note to the Working Group: For checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2, we should  change "rendered text" to "visually rendered text" to be more  precise.

      Hello,    Here is a proposed agenda for today's teleconference:    1) Review the attached list of proposed changes.  2) Continue through the list of outstanding issues [1]      (many of which are addressed by attached proposals).     I will be augmenting the issues list throughout the      day as I process email.    WHEN:  March 22, 4:00pm - 5:30pm (GMT -5)  WHERE: +1 617-252-7000 (Tobin bridge)      Regrets: Wendy.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Proposed changes to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines    Reference document [1]  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990316    1) To clearly indicate the division between author responsibility     and user agent responsibility:       a) All checkpoints involving interim responsibility from        authors will contain the wording "Until user agents ..."        These checkpoints are: all of guideline 9, all of guideline 12,        checkpoint 15.4 (group related links), and 1.7         (Provide redundant text links for each active region of an          image map.)       b) For each checkpoint, include the "until" wording since        checkpoints may be read on their own. It is not sufficient        to say it in the guideline rationale.        c) Include an explanation of what "Until user agents..." means.        Proposed text:       <BLOCKQUOTE>      In some of the checkpoints below, content developers are      clearly the best candidates for ensuring accessibility.      However, there are times when user agents would be the better      choice. Unfortunately, not all user agents or assistive      technologies provide the accessibility control users require      (e.g., some user agents may not allow users to turn off blinking      content, or some screen readers may not handle tables well).         To address cases where the responsibility for providing      accessible control lies with the user agent or assistive      technology but that control is not yet easily available, certain      checkpoints contain the phrase "until user agents ...". When      content developers see this phrase, they should recognize that      they are being asked to provide additional support for      accessibility until most user agents meet users' needs.         For each checkpoint with this phrase, content developers must      consider:   1.What is their anticipated audience? For example,    designing for a company intranet where everyone uses    the same browser is different than designing for the    World Wide Web.   2.Do those users have tools available that satisfy the    demands of the checkpoint?         If the answer to the second question is yes, content developers      are not required to satisfy the checkpoint.         How will content developers know when most user agents or      assistive technologies meet specific needs? The W3C WAI will      make this information available from its Web site (either directly      or by providing links to the information). Content developers      are encouraged to consult this information regularly for updates      on accessibility support.      </BLOCKQUOTE>      2) Divide checkpoint 9.2 into two checkpoints.      Current text:                 Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen                  that causes flicker. [Priority 1]       Proposed change:         a) Priority 1:  Until user agents allow users to                        control it, avoid causing the screen to                        flicker. [Add note about epilepsy here.]         b) Priority 2: Until user agents allow users to control it,                       avoid causing content to blink (i.e.,                      change presentation at a regular rate,                       such as turning on and off).    3) Proposed change in wording of Note in guideline 12.     Current wording:              The following checkpoints apply until most            users are able to secure newer           technologies that address these issues.       Proposed wording to emphasize user agents:             The following checkpoints apply until            user agents and assistive technologies address           these issues.    4) Do references designated the latest versions     of documents or dated versions?       Proposed:       a) Add a link from checkpoint 13.1 (Use the latest W3C specs)          to the references section.       b) In the references section, add a statement about          where to find the current versions of W3C specs.       c) The list of references will contain dated versions so          that readers will know what existed when the guidelines          were created.       d) To each entry in the list, add a link to the latest          version.         /* Once the WG has made a decision, inform Misha who          raised this issue in [2] */     [2]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0333.html    5) Changes for guideline 6.       a) In 6.3, add "including text equivalents (e.g., captions)"    6) Changes for guideline 9.       a) All checkpoints in guideline 9 priority 2        except for the one about flicker.    7) Changes for guideline 15.       a) Move note about LINK relationships from 15.3 to 15.2     b) Move 15.10 to after 15.3.     c) Change priority level of 15.6 to 2.     d) Merge 15.4 and 15.5 into a priority 2 checkpoint.        Proposed wording:               Provide information about the general layout              of a site (e.g., a site map, or table of contents).      e) For 15.9:        i) Add an "until user agents" statement.       ii) Add more rationale (e.g., performance)      iii) Proposed wording: Facilitate offline browsing.    8) In Abstract, make clear that this is a reference document     and that for more information, readers should consult the     EO Web site.    9) Add a definition of "assistive technology" to the glossary.    10) Add a section about document conventions to "How the      guidelines are organized". This includes:     a) Element names are uppercase.     b) Attribute names are quoted lowercase.     c) Describe linking conventions.    11) Discussion of browser support for elements and attributes     is outside the scope of this document. Need help from     WAI CG and Web Characterization Activity.        

      Hello,    Charles and I propose the following requirements for   these checkpoints (from "Determining Conformance to the User   Agent Guidelines 1.0" [1]):       Checkpoint 4.1  Allow the user to configure the size of text.     Checkpoint 4.2  Allow the user to configure font family.     Checkpoint 4.3  Allow the user to configure foreground color.     Checkpoint 4.4  Allow the user to configure background color.     Since fonts and colors are generally managed at the OS  level, we propose stating that the user agent is expected  to provide access to system colors and fonts. It's hard  to specify a lower or upper bound for colors and fonts,  so we would rather set expectations than firm  requirements. One million colors is more than ample choice,   but 16 or 256 probably suffice to provide access.     For fonts, font family and text size go together  except for vectorial fonts. For vectorial fonts  or other magnification techniques, how do we establish  acceptable limits?      -Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

You can control the rendering of the "alt" and "title" attributes  with CSS2:   a) Get the value of the attribute with an attribute selector   b) Use :before or :after to insert the text (whose style can      be specified) before or after the element's content.    This is, of course, different from the current tooltip mechanism  which does not involve/change the document's rendering at all.  With relative positioning, the 'visibility' property, and scripts,  you can even simulate a tooltip effect.      - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

      Hello,    The Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group did a useful study  of the implementability of their Guidelines. Their study showed  that some tool has already implemented every checkpoint, though  no tool yet satisfies all the checkpoints.    I think we should offer a similar statement to the Director  about the implementability of the UA Guidelines when we go  to Proposed Recommendation.    As you review the document, please indicate whether, for  each checkpoint, you are aware of a UA that implements  the checkpoint.    We already have documented how some user agents satisfy  or don't satisfy the guidelines (linked from the Home Page [1]).

That's a good idea, although I'm not sure where in the beginning  of the document this would go.     We have a section entitled "Testing UA operation with platform  standards" in the Techniques document and this should be emphasized  there.

      Hello,    Marja Koivunen has pointed out to me that checkpoints   4.14 and 4.15 of the 1 September Guidelines have minor problems.  The checkpoints are:    <OLD>  4.14 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted   (e.g., foreground and background color). Offer  at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts.   Allow the user to select from among the range of  system colors and fonts. [Priority 1]     4.15 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is   highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).  Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and   fonts. Allow the user to select from among the range  of system colors and fonts. The default focus highlight mechanism   must be different from the default selection  highlight mechanism. [Priority 1]   </OLD>    The problems are:    a) Neither checkpoint talks about non-visual highlighting  b) Neither checkpoint includes a minimum requirement for     non-visual highlighting.    To address this, I propose the following changes:    1) List "voice pitch" as an example of how audio highlighting     might be done.    2) Specify that the minimal requirements mentioned (fonts and colors)     apply to graphical user agents.    3) Do not include minimal requirements for non-visual highlighting, but     add a cross reference to checkpoint 4.12 (speech parameter control).    <NEW>  Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted  (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).   For graphical user interfaces, offer at least three rendering   options, including colors and fonts.  Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and  fonts.    Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted   (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).   For graphical user interfaces, offer at least three rendering options,   including colors and fonts.

Can you explain how this works? What does it mean for a viewport  to be available but not open? Does that mean open but iconified?  That is only considering the visual model.     - Ian    >  Your  > solution sounds OK too, but if a user decides not to open the navigation  > frame, they may have problems using the Web page.

I entirely agree that the user should be able to get easily   at viewports that did not open; that's part of the checkpoint  I proposed.     - Ian       > Jon  >   > At 03:42 PM 7/7/2000 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Hello,  > >  > >I'm working on a new draft that I will publish later this  > >afternoon.

I think that all the documents should be Recommendations.  But you only claim conformance to the technology-specific ones.  There is no requirement at W3C that a Recommendation have conformance  provisions, so we can publish a set of fairly abstract principles  that can be the basis for later technology specific profiles.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    Issue 210 [1] is about adding the term "author-specified" to  the guidelines so that, for example, we can distinguish text equivalents  that may be recognized by the UA from those that cannot (e.g.,  when they are in prose). I would like to amend my proposal:    1) We don't need to define "author-specified". It's understandable as  is.  2) We add the provision to the applicability clause. So a checkpoint or     portion of a checkpoint applies unless:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  It includes requirements about the purpose of content  (e.g., transcript, caption, text equivalent, etc.)  that the user agent cannot <a href="#def-recognize">recognize</a>   through markup. For instance, HTML user agents can recognize "alt",  OBJECT content, or NOFRAMES content as providing equivalents for  other content since these are specified by the markup language.   HTML user agents are not expected to recognize that an  image description embedded in a paragraph is a text equivalent  for the image.  </BLOCKQUOTE>    I started to add "that the UA can recognize" to the checkpoints   everywhere and realized it would be simpler to just a provision to   the applicability clause. This applies to a lot of situations. For  instance, the user might compose an image using ascii art, but the  user agent is not required to recognize it as "an image" (having  the purpose of an image).      - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#210  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Checkpoint 8.7 in the 7 July 2000 UA Guidelines [1] reads:       8.7 Allow the user to configure and control which link information          required by checkpoint 8.6 to present. [Priority 3]     This checkpoint (which has always been vague) made more sense  when the amount of information the user might receive to help  him or her decide whether to follow a link was potentially large.  However, we have succeeded in making 8.6 very specific so that  so that it now requires only 7 pieces of information:       8.6 To help the user decide whether to follow a link, make          available to the user the following information: link         content, link title, whether the link is internal, whether          the link has been followed, whether following it may         involve a fee, and information about the type, size, and natural          language of the linked resource. [Priority 3]               Note: User agents are not required to retrieve the                 resource designated by a link as part of computing                information about the link.       PROPOSAL 1:    In light of the new scope of checkpoint 8.6, I propose that we  DELETE checkpoint 8.7. The difference between seven pieces of   information and three, for example, is not very significant.   I believe that configuration in this case will no longer be   helpful and may complicate the user interface.    PROPOSAL 2:    I think we should make the following changes to checkpoint 8.6:    a) Delete resource size requirement. This information may be provided by  an      an HTTP Content-Length entity-header field (HTTP 1.1 [2], section  14.13).     This means that the UA must sent an HTTP request to the server, and I      understood our Note after the checkpoint to mean that a UA would not      have to send such requests.    b) Clarify the definition of "followed link". For instance:     b.i) A link may be considered followed (i.e., a resource has already          been visited) for a finite period. The user should          be able to configure this period. I don't think configuration of  this          period should be a UA requirement.       b.ii) The UA establishes the scope for "visited". Thus, a user may  tell the            UA to consider links not visited even if the user has in fact  visited           them (i.e., "pretend as though I've never followed any links").    c) Clarify that in some cases, information may be hints provided by the     author. For instance, content type and content language may be  specified in      HTML by certain attributes (e.g., "type" and "hreflang") but these  are just     hints to the UA. The definitive information comes from the HTTP  transaction.     Since I believe our goal was to make author-specified information  available to     the user, the UA should only be required to make available the hints,  not     the actual content type or language.     -Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707/  [2] ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt    --  Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hi Phill,    For now, the Web Content WG will be tracking such  information. However, I agree that in the medium-term, it  would be appropriate for the UA WG to at least participate  in tracking this information, if not taking over the responsibility  entirely.    This should be discussed/confirmed by the WAI CG.      - Ian.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I believe that the only reason ATAG declares the HTML 4.0 loose DTD is  that  Amaya keeps putting that declaration at the top of the file. I've put  the strict DTD there with emacs, but when Charles edits with Amaya,  it reverts to transitional.

      Hello,    In the 23 October draft [1], checkpoints 4.3 and 4.4  ensure control of foreground and background colors of  all text:    4.3 Allow the user to configure the foreground color of all      text, with an option to override author-specified,       and user agent default, foreground colors.       Allow the user to select from among the      range of system colors. [Priority 1]     4.4 Allow the user to configure the background color of all       text, with an option to override author-specified,      and user agent default background colors.       Allow the user to select from among the      range of system colors. [Priority 1]     The checkpoints have the same priority and almost  always appear together in the guidelines and techniques  documents.     Reasons to merge them:     1) One less P1 checkpoint, same requirements.   2) Since they should be set as a pair (by authors, users),       it is convenient that they be listed as a pair.    I propose the following formulation of the merged   checkpoints (a little easier to read, I think):    <NEW>  Allow the user to configure the foreground and background   color of all text, with an option to override foreground   and background colors specified by the author or user agent   defaults. Allow the user to select from among the range of  system colors.  </NEW>    NOTE: As part of an action item for issue 348 [2], I am  reviewing this checkpoint and others related to styling  selection and focus. I may propose additional changes  to this and other checkpoints as part of this action, but  I expect that in any case, foreground and background color  requirements will be in a single checkpoint.     - Ian    P.S. The first group of checkpoint in Guideline 4  is entitled    "Checkpoints for fonts and colors (content accessibility)"    Since these checkpoints (now 3) are only about visually  rendered text (and not colors for all content), I propose  reducing the scope of the title to:     "Checkpoints for visually rendered text (content accessibility)"    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-348  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

For 6.1 and 6.3:    Does this mean access to content in comments or content hidden  by style sheets?    Alternative content may not be rendered but we want users to have  access to it.     Thus, it may still make sense to keep two checkpoints:    - Access to (rendered?) content.    - Access to alternative content (and each language specifies where  that comes from).    For 6.6: When alternative text has been specified explicitly as           empty (i.e., an empty string), render nothing.       This is a rendering issue with a particular purpose. It could be  considered     a technique of 6.3, but I think it's probably been included as a  checkpoint     to ensure non-confusing rendering.     > 6.7, 6.9 and 6.10 Where multiple alternatives exist, allow the user to choose  > which are rendered.

One guideline talks  about turning on/off, the other about (finer) control over information.  Although I think on/off functionality is subsumbed by finer control,   I don't think those checkpoints should be absorbed - on/off should  remain  separate. One reason is that on/off control is supposed to stop that  which reduces accessibility, while finer control is supposed to allow  greater accessibility (and no, I don't consider that the same as  "reduce inaccessibility").    Thus, we are dealing with two principles and I think two guidelines  could  remain.     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hello,    I have published the 18 December version of the ATAG Guidelines [1]  and Techniques Document [2]. In addition to changes made  by Charles (which I will let him document), I made the following  changes:    1) Incorporated changes from 15 Dec atag teleconf     http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/telecon-15dec99    2) Incorporated editorial changes from Ian's propsals of 12 December     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999OctDec/0295.html    3) Deleted the term "impairment" and replaced with "disability"     (one occurrence). Based on 14 December CG decision to not use  "impairment"     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-wai-cg/1999OctDec/0053.html    4) Deleted the term "alt-text" and replace with "text-equivalent"     (notably in the section on A-prompt).    5) Changed "fulfill a checkpoint" to "satisfy a checkpoint"     (for unity with other guidelines).    6) Added the following links:     a) Techniques now back link to the Guidelines (via the checkpoint  number)        Linking is to the latest version of the guidelines.     b) Samples (e.g., Amaya) now back link to the Techniques (via        the checkpoint number)    7) I made some changes to the document processing machinery to     align ATAG and UAAG (and ultimately WCAG). Readers should notice     absolutely no different. But if you remark anything strange,      please let the editors know.

      24 August 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Eric Hansen   Kitch Barnicle    Denis Anson   Gregory Rosmaita   David Poehlman   Tim Lacy   Dick Brown   Harvey Bingham   Rich Schwerdtfeger (for 2 minutes)    Regrets:   Mickey Quenzer   Jim Allan    Absent:   Charles McCathieNevile    Next meeting: 31 August    Minutes of previous meeting:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0256.html    Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0293.html        1.Issue 310: What level of WCAG compliance should checkpoint 11.1         require or should it be relative priority?        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#310        JG: One option is to include in your conformance claim what      at what level you conform to the documentation.        IJ: This requires a reviewer to go look at the claim in detail.      You don't know from "Level X" what the UA will have done for      checkpoint 11.1.        EH: Since P3 requirements "may help" accessibility, it seems like      requiring that for UA 1.0 is too stringent.        GR: Some WCAG 1.0 P3 requirements are very useful (e.g.,      acronyms). I think that it should be Level Triple-A in all cases.        DP: If you're developing a UA and your documentation is on the       Web, but your UA doesn't conform, that may be confusing. I agree      with GR.        IJ: The best documentation is no documentation...        IJ: I hear three proposals:         1) Level Double-A always          JG: This covers all things that would make access either              impossible or difficult. One reason in particular:              table formatting.             DA: Why does documentation have to rise to a higher level              than other checkpoints?            EH: Note that since we're allowing conformance by composite              UAs, the multiplicative effect is relevant.         2) Level Triple-A always       3) Relative priority          DB, TL: Intriguing (graceful), but may be complicated.        HB: Note that you could have bad, but accessible, documentation.        KB: As I look at the P3 checkpoints in WCAG 1.0, I'm not convinced      that all of them will make a difference. Some of them may, and      perhaps the WCAG WG should re-evaluate checkpoint priorities.        Level Double A minimal: KB, EH, DA, JG, IJ, DP, DB, TL      Level Triple A minimal: HB, GR        Resolved: Level Double minimal requirement for checkpoint 11.1.                Note: There was dissent on this resolution. WG                participants may request that their objections be                carried forth.        5.Issue 309: Applicability needs review: how to tell when                    checkpoint MUST be followed.        http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#309        Refer to analyses:          IJ: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/08/uaag10-applic          EH:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0297.html        EH: I think it's ok to have applicability issues, but the tighter  our      focus is for this document (type of UA we're intending this      document for) the more the applicability issues disappear. For      instance, we're talking about UAs that implement text, graphics,      audio, and video. If you assume this in the target UA, you don't      need applicability clauses for these content types.        IJ: I agree with EH that the tighter the document, the fewer      applicability provisions are necessary. But I am not comfortable      with too much tightening (e.g., you have to implement audio in       order to conform).        EH: Note also that the less inapplicability, the greater the      likelihood that conformance will translate to accessibility.         IJ: EH has identified the "moving part" in the document: more      flexibility to conform means you either say nothing about      the moving part (let reasonable people interpret claims) or      you point to them in applicability clauses.        EH: I'm concerned about pursuing some of my proposals before      some distinctions are addressed in WCAG.          IJ: What about folding in the provision into the checkpoints?       (e.g., if you support X, allow control of X). But this can      get heavier as you have to combine provisions.        EH: I think we need to remove "graphical" from our description      of the target UA since graphics are not required by the document.        GR: I think that the applicability provisions should be folded      into the checkpoint somehow. Reduce work on the implementors.        EH: Applicability provisions are pretty intuitive: if you don't      support you don't have to do. If you explain this idea in one      place, you don't need to repeat in each checkpoint.        IJ: We didn't say for WCAG: "For any table that you use, use      table headers."         Resolved:      a) Incorporate proposal (only four provisions)         http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/08/uaag10-applic      b) Include informative list of checkpoints for the remaining         four. If the WG doesn't like this, get rid of.        JG: Ask developers at last call whether they want applicability      incorporated in the checkpoints.        Resolved: Change "graphical general purpose UAs" to       "general purpose UAs".        IJ: EH, have we missed other pieces besides "native", "recognize",      and "applicability" from your proposals?        EH: Possibly "primary/alternative".         IJ: We'll get to with issue 297, I think.        2.Issue 292: Review list of speech synthesizer characteristics         (checkpoint 4.11)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#292        HB: Gender and pitch are very similar. You could get away with          gender alone. Some japanese users, for example, require more          information in inflection.        DA: Voice for a sighted person differ from requirements for a      blind person.        /* Reduce the list? */        HB: No, satisfied with current list.         /* Add to the list? */      GR's proposal:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0467.html        IJ: How do you tell your speech synthesizer what you want?      If you're implementing CSS2 aural style sheets, I know how      the mapping from content to rendering works. Otherwise?        DA: It seems like that the user should be able to configure  everything      that's configurable.        IJ Proposal:       a) Leave speech synthesizer checkpoints as they are.       b) Ensure that Voice Browser WG documents include accessibility          features. There is a WG dedicated to this topic.        GR: Need to ensure that UAs don't preclude users from configuring      their speech synthesizer software.        GR: Propose : speak-out, speak-punctuation, and number processing       (as described in CSS2 speak-numeral).         Resolved:          a) Add verbiage for configuration of spelling, punctuation,             and number processing offered by the speech engine.         b) Get Voice Browser WG review of these three checkpoints            in last call.         c) Ensure coordination with VBWG for future coordination.

I agree with Al, although Nir's point is well-taken -- that the  statement from the Recommendation:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  NOFRAMES can be used in the FRAMESET section of a frameset document.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    is misleading since NOFRAMES (and IFRAME) can appear as well  in a document using the Transitional DTD.    We use the phrasing "user agents that do not support frames   or are configured not to display frames" throughout the chapter  to refer to situations when NOFRAMES content should be rendered.   We should have said more explicitly that this  was the intended meaning of "when frames are not being   displayed" and we should have added for clarity "whatever DTD is in  use".     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

      Hello WAI Interest Group,    The review period of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (UAAG  1.0) Proposed Recommendation (PR) ended 7 April 2000, and you may be  wondering about the User Agent Working Group's (UAWG) progress since  then. The UAWG resolved most of issues raised during PR in the weeks  that followed the end of the review (thanks, in part, to a  face-to-face meeting at the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic in  Princeton, New Jersey in early April).    However, a few issues proved more difficult to resolve quickly.  Several reviewers commented that some of the requirements  (checkpoints) were too vague and it was therefore difficult to  determine what a user agent needed to implement in order to  conform. As a result, for the last several months, the UAWG has been  clarifying and sharpening the requirements of the document.  These clarifications and links to disucssion and resolutions  are documented in "Determining Conformance to the User Agent   Guidelines" [1]. The actual changes have been incorporated directly  into the UAAG 1.0 (refer to the 18 August draft [2]).    The UAWG still has a few issues [3] to resolve, but is nearly ready to  request a last call review of the document. To the extent possible,  the UAWG has made changes that clarify the document but do not add new  requirements. The complete revision history of the UAAG 1.0   and Techniques is available on the Web [4].    Your review during the upcoming last call will be very important. You  may send comments to the Working Group about the 18 August draft [2]  (and probably should send important comments), but if you intend a  substantial last call review, we recommend waiting until the last call  period begins, a more formal indicator that the UAWG considers it has  completed its task.

      Hello,    We've published a new version of the Guidelines and Techniques  documents at [1] and [2]. They are also available from the Group  page [3].    Note that there are some major structural changes in these  documents, and the editors tried to take into account many  of the suggestions from the face-to-face meeting, but  we haven't had a chance to integrate the latest comments.    --  Changes since the last versions:    1) Major structural changes to both the guidelines and     techniques documents. In particular:      a) The table of contents of the guidelines document         has changed and is now simpler, reflecting         the primary principles of accessible UAs         b) The table of contents of the techniques document         has been designed with UA interfaces in mind.        c) There are a few new techniques, but since they         are lost in the middle of a lot of restructured         techniques, readers should probably review         all of the techniques anyway.    2) Techniques are now numbered.    3) The priorities sections now differ and UA developers     are instructed that they are not required to "satisfy"     the guidelines, only follow them. They are required     to implement the techniques.       The priorities section in the guidelines document needs     work.     4) There is new text in the techniques document about     media dependences.    5) There is new text in the techniques documents about     native vs. assistive support for techniques. The     text is there, but the techniques themselves do not     yet indicate which techniques must be supported natively.    6) The section on point of regard, selection, focus, and events     in the guidelines document has been largely rewritten.      STILL TO DO:     1) We need to flesh out the techniques document   2) We need to establish the definitive priorities for      guidelines and techniques.   3) We need to establish which techniques must be      implemented natively.   4) We need more rationale text (from contributing      WG members)   5) We need to complete the sections on accessibility      features of different languages (HTML/CSS/SMIL)   6) We need to ensure that the accessibility API      appendix is correct and up-to-date.   7) We need to complete the appendixes:        a) Techniques grouped by HTML theme (e.g., tables)        b) Techniques grouped by HTML element (if applicable)    We await your comments and corrections.     - Ian and Jon    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981030/  [2]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981030/wai-useragent-tech  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

      Hello,    Here's why I think a table navigation checkpoint isn't  required (and this, I believe is a summary of the history  of how we got to where we are today):    1) Checkpoint 2.1 requires access to all content.  2) Checkpoint 8.1 requires the UA to communicate relationships     among cells and headers  3) Checkpoint 7.6 requires navigation to meaningful elements, which     includes tables and table cells in the case of HTML.    Therefore, I believe that Charles' requirement is already met  by the current set of checkpoints, and the current set of checkpoints  is the result of work that led to us removing checkpoints for  navigation to elements of a particular type.

IJ2: If HTML is broken, ask that it be fixed. I don't think we should  enter  the realm of repair checkpoints at this point in the life of the  document.  We can make suggestions in techniques for the case of HTML.

      Hello,    I think the WG should strengthen a statement  in the guidelines that any important   content inserted by a style sheet be available in the   document source as well (rationale: device-independence,  users can override styles, etc.)    The line between content and style is blurred by some  parts of CSS. Style sheets may cause numbers or words  to be generated in the rendering structure, just as they   can insert images. Most users will have a difficult time   distinguishing the document tree from the rendering structure,   and will have to read the style sheets to find  out whether "1.2" was generated by styles (and therefore  may be changed through styles) or inserted by hand.     In the Techniques document of 5 May, we raise this issue  obliquely:       Text generated by style sheets is not part of the      document source and will not be available to assistive      technologies that access content through DOM, level 1      ([DOM1]).     I think we need to make a stronger point.    Here's an example. W3C Recommendations use a background image   in the upper left hand corner to indicate on graphical browsers that  that they are Recommendations. There is no alt text for this  image since it's inserted by a style sheet (and CSS  has no  mechanism  for specifying alt text. On the one hand,  one can argue that if the information is being inserted  by a style sheet it is only meant for style, not content,  and therefore not alt text is necessary. On the other  hand, people argue that one shouldn't put text in images  but should use styles so that the text is accessible.  Also, languages like SVG that create graphics will real  text in them tout the accessibility benefits.    Does the title of the document suffice to convey  the document status?     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

The answer is:    1) All requirements must be satisfied (subject to applicability)  2) It doesn't matter which component of a claim satisfies the different  requirements;     conformance is for the subject of the claim as a whole.    Therefore, we have no need to distinguish between operating system,  browser, plug-ins,  or anything else - all you need to know is that the components in the  conformance claim  satisfy the checkpoints.     - Ian    > As it stands now, it is unclear as to areas of responsibility, which will  > result in lack of non-conformance by possibly all of the above.

      Hello,    Per my action item assigned at the 15 February 2001  teleconference [1] about issue 443 [2], please consider this  proposal for which device-dependent repair requirements should  appear in UAAG 1.0.    Checkpoint 1.1 of the 26 January 2001 Guidelines [3] states:       "Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through     keyboard input alone, pointing device input alone, and voice     input alone. [Priority 1]"    I propose splitting this checkpoint in three (rough wording  here):      Checkpoint A: "Ensure that the user can operate the user agent's    native functionalities through keyboard input alone, pointing    device input alone, and voice input alone. [Priority 1]"      Checkpoint B: "Ensure that the user can operate    device-independent functionalities specified in content through    keyboard input alone, pointing device input alone, and voice    input alone. [Priority 1]"      Checkpoint C: "Allow configuration so that the user can operate    device-dependent functionalities specified in content through    other devices (e.g., simulate pointing device specific behavior    through the keyboard). In this configuration, alert the user when    an active element has device-specific behaviors associated.    [Priority 3]"    I think that checkpoint C should be Priority 3 because it is  likely to provide incomplete repair. Thus, it clearly does not  qualify for P1 by definition:       "This checkpoint must be satisfied by user agents, otherwise     one or more groups of users with disabilities will find it     impossible to access the Web."    There is no guarantee that if satisfied, checkpoint C will make  access possible. [I would also note that our priority statements  don't say anything about the responsibilities of other  parties. This is clearly an authoring issue first.]    Consider these scenarios:    1) The author has created content that is device independent. In  this case, checkpoint B applies.    2) The author has created content that is device-dependent, but   has also provided alternative content (per WCAG 1.0 checkpoints  9.2 and 11.4). In this case, emulation is not required since the  author has ensured access.    3) The author has created content that is device-dependent, and  has not provided an alternative. The device-dependent content is  either:      a) Content that doesn't really depend on a particular device       but has just been encoded that way, or      b) Content that really does depend on a particular device       (e.g., a user interface where the user scratches the        "silver paint" on an electronic lottery ticket to         reveal a hidden number).    The user agent can't recognize the difference in general, since  handlers are built with scripts. So that means that, in general,  the user agent is not likely to repair any better content of type  (3a) over content of type (3b).    Repair in case (3a) is probably useful to some users, can be  carried out automatically, and is technically feasible (e.g., the  UA could throw an "onmouseover" event whenever an "onfocus" event  occurs, or implement a "zap-mouse-to-focus" functionality).    However, in case (3b), emulation is not likely to help some  users.  Even a tool such as MouseKeys will not help some users  (e.g., users who are blind) interact with the user interface. If  the author has designed content that expressly takes advantage of  the nature of two-dimensional visual space, there's not much  users who are blind can do with certainty. Worse, emulating mouse  events might cause unexpected behavior to occur, thus  disorienting the user.  And, emulation of certain pointing device  events is less obvious (e.g., how do you translate "onmousemove"  to the keyboard?), so repair by the UA would likely be incomplete  on this axis as well.    In our current definition of "active element", we don't expect  the user agent to recognize (and thus repair) the class of  author-specified behaviors that are encoded through "event  bubbling" techniques.    Finally, the user agent should not be required to emulate  mouse-specific behaviors that are not controlled by the user  agent (e.g., the case of server-side image maps).    ----------  CONCLUSION  ----------    - Emulation of author-supplied device-specific behaviors seems to  be useful for some cases, and not helpful (or even disorienting)  in others.     - The user agent is not expected to recognize the useful cases  from the non-useful cases since behaviors are encoded through  scripts today. This means that the user agent couldn't "warn" the  user, for example.    - Repair functionalities are likely to be incomplete and not  guarantee access, so I think that they should be Priority 3.     - Ian    ----------  References  ----------    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0227.html  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010126/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The other requirements documents currently  in development are Working Drafts, including:    http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-reusable-dialog-reqs-20000426  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Requirements-20000412  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xhtml-forms-req-20000329  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xmlquery-req-20000131  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-voice-tts-reqs-19991223    While there's nothing that prevents the Working Group  from requesting publication as a Note, I recommend that  you request publication as a Working Draft since this  is a work in progress. The requirements will certainly  evolve as the Working Group continues to work.     There is no requirement that a Working Draft advance  to Recommendation. At a later date, the WG may choose,  to incorporate the requirements as an appendix to  the WCAG 2.0 Recommendation. Or the Working Group can  request publication of the final requirements as a   Note. But for now, I recommend requesting Working  Draft status.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Per my action item of the 15 March 2001 teleconference [1],  please consider this proposal related to toggling placeholders.  In the 9 March draft [2], checkpoints 3.2 (P1) and 3.7 (P2) involve  configuration requirements to render placeholders instead of  visual content, and to allow activation of these placeholders   (to view the original content).    (Refer to my related proposal [3] which allows not just rendering  original content in context, but also in a separate viewport.)    Denis stated at the 15 March meeting that some users with  cognitive disabilities might be disoriented by an excess of  visual information, whether that information was rendered   automatically all at once or as the result of one-at-a-time   activation of too many placeholders. For this reason,   he argued that checkpoints 3.2 and 3.7 should also include   a requirement to toggle video/images back off.    It's possible to achieve the desired results (i.e., rendering  one image at any given moment) by following these steps,   all guaranteed by existing checkpoints:     a) Configure the user agent not to render images (3.7)   b) Replace one placeholder with the associated image (3.7)   c) Reload the page (giving all placeholders again)   d) Start at (b) with the next placeholder in the document.    That's not convenient (since you have to reload the page), but  it's possible. Therefore, I propose the following P2 checkpoint:     3.x If activation of a placeholder required by checkpoints    3.2 and 3.7 causes the placeholder to be replaced in context    by the original author-supplied content, allow the user to    undo the action (by turning the visual content off and the   placeholder on again).        Note: If the user agent satisfies the placeholder         activation requirement by rendering the author-supplied         content in a new viewport, the user can close the new        viewport per checkpoint 5.3    Comment:     1) I'm not terribly in favor of adding this checkpoint, but       Denis' point is well-taken. I'd be more comfortable if      this were a P3 checkpoint, but I don't know how serious      the usability issue is.     2) Do we have any implementation experience for this? Aaron      suggested that Mozilla lets users toggle content on and off.     - Ian     [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0427  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0454  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

If the repair content is  included in the document object, then it will be available through  the DOM. If the repair content is "just rendered" (or for any  reason not in the DOM) then it will not be available through the  DOM (to assistive technologies). This document does not require  that generated repair content (including repair text) appear  in the DOM.     > [Guideline 3]  >   > Along these lines, it is noteworthy to mention that repetitive and  > redundant content can reduce accessibility to a great extent.

How does  the user agent know that content A is redundant to content B  (and furthermore that the redundancy isn't for the express  purpose of promoting accessibility)?     > [Checkpoint 3.5]  >   > Just a reminder that allowing the user to "configure the user agent  > not to execute scripts or applets" in many cases will result in no  > content being rendered, unless the content author has provided  > equivalent accessible content, which unfortunately is currently an  > uncommon situation.    Thus the requirement that the user agent alert the user that scripts  are available but not being executed. This should help the user guess  why there is no content available. I propose to add this scenario  to the techniques document as another piece of rationale.     > [Checkpoints 3.6 and 3.7]  >   > These checkpoints both discuss author-specified redirects (supported  > by a HTML META element with http-equiv="refresh").

I think the idea is to point people to information  about doing server-side redirects *instead of* client-side  redirects.

Can you explain why this is?

Is checkpoint 4.18 a special case of 4.20 ?    Not exactly, though they are related:     4.18 is about focus changes (which may be disorienting)   4.20 is about viewport changes (which may be disoriented for other  reasons,     including the sheer number of viewports, or one viewport hiding  another).    Often, when a viewport opens, the focus shifts automatically to it.  That's  what 4.18 is meant to cover.      > [Checkpoint 6.1]  >   > Unless I have misinterpreted it's meaning, this Priority 1 checkpoint  > requires all accessibility features of all implemented specifications  > to be implemented such that they comply with all requirements of the  > Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

This issue was raised in the first last call (issue 111).     http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111    At their 10 December 1999 face-to-face meeting, the   Working Group decided to leave this as a Priority 1 checkpoint  for a very specific purpose: to give authors the possiblity  of using "P3" WCAG requirements. The WG felt quite strongly  that if user agent developers don't take the lead in implementing  features that promote accessibility, then having P3 requirements  in WCAG will serve no purpose.        http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991210#issue-111     > [Guideline 7]  >   > This section describes three (3) separate modes of content navigation.  > Sequential in which content is advanced line by line with link choices  > made active as they appear (and deactivated as they disappear) within  > the context of other content on the page; Direct in which content is  > bypassed by specifying some selection criteria that if met directs the  > focus of the viewport directly to the desired content or link; and  > finally Structured wherein important structural items (headers,  > titles, etc) are presented without the corresponding intervening  > non-structural content.  >   > In point of fact, there is actually a fourth mode possible, which  > could be described as "Oriented-Direct" in which content and links are  > rendered sequentially in-context, but links are available for direct  > access to web resources at any time, (i.e. during, after) even  > immediately prior to content rendering.

I'm not sure what "content only" means. Aren't links part of content?  Or do you mean a kind of "read-only" presentation where the user  cannot interact with the document?

Agreed. I think that the definition will probably evolve due  to issue #358:     http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#358     > To take the "full moon" example found within this definition:  >   > If an image of a full moon exists in the content, there is no method,  > short of complex image analysis, for a user-agent to determine on it's  > own that the image should be described as a "full moon", "harvest  > moon" or "white disk".  >   > Selection, current selection  >   > The suggestion that selected content should be rendered as "inflected  > speech" by a speech synthesis system is somewhat questionable.

      25 January 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0114.html    Minutes of previous meeting 22 January:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0105.html    Next meeting: 1 February       Possible regrets: Mickey Quenzer    Present:      Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs (scribe), Harvey Bingham, David Poehlman,     Al Gilman, Charles McCathieNevile, Eric Hansen, Tim Lacy, Greg     Lowney, Rich Schwerdtfeger       Regrets: Kitch Barnicle, Denis Anson, Jim Allan, Gregory Rosmaita    Absent:        Mickey Quenzer    -------------  Announcements  -------------     - Today is HB's birthday!   - Will be attending ftf (from this call): HB, JG, IJ, AG (part-time)     Also: RS, KB(?), EH(?)     No: JA, DP     Don't know: DA    -------  ISSUES  -------    2.Issue 452: Checkpoint 2.2: Review minimal requirement (three options?)    Source:  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#452    Resolved:    - Adopt Ian's proposal with clarifications that user input is      "completed" when the user says so.      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0111.html      - Add techniques based on the WCAG comments.      The UA may offer other techniques to double or triple       time intervals, which may also be useful.      ----------------------------------------------      AG reading comments from Gregg Vanderheiden:      "you need to provide more options for companies: three option      approach").        IJ: We chose "infinite" as the minimal requirement to be      sure that the user has enough time. The other options may be      nice but exceed the minimal requirement.        AG: I think that GV is responding from the perspective of      preventing a denial of service attack. But that's not the      stateless HTTP case. So his considerations may not be      driven by the Web's architecture.        JG: Even with statelessness, your cookie could expire (e.g.,      due to security reasons).          IJ: We talk about client-controlled timing only.        AG: A likely case where you might have timeouts is the      case of voice browsing.        DP: All of my time-out experience has been server-side.        IJ: Should we try to address server-side control? We already      cover client-side control.        AG: That falls into server administration, and the proper solution      is probably to build in more time in the server. You can call this      a content problem (for WCAG) or an HTTP problem (for PF). The      protocol by which you ask for more time should be in HTTP or      CC/PP. You don't want this on a page-by-page basis. You want a       generic macro.        AG: Another client-side control scenario is periodic refresh.        JG: So say to reviewer that some of his concerns about time          extensions are server-side issues.     ----------    For definition of "presentation":   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0119.html    Resolved from Ian's proposal.     - Delete the term "presentation" from the glossary   - Leave 3.2 as is, change content label to Image.   - Delete checkpoint 3.4 since we aren't aware of     blinking images on the Web.    /* GL and TL join */    ------------------    1.Issue 389: Conformance: Hard to test conformance in an objective                fashion.    Source:  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#389      Status: I wrote the reviewer with clarifications and asked for             comment. No response yet.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0038.html      Proposed resolution by IJ: We have reduced some of the conformance    requirements as a result of the reviewer's comments. We have worked    very hard on this conformance scheme and rejected a number of    others. If the reviewer has specific suggestions, we will consider    them.      GL: My concerns about conformance to the document:     - The checkpoint wording is so broad that it's very difficult       to understand what it means unless you refer to notes,       techniques.       - If the document had been less ambiguous, I would not have had       as many questions.       - I don't believe it's possible to define something that's       objectively measurable in terms of conformance without getting       technology-specific. What you have is probably as good as you       can get and still be platform-independent.       - You need techniques documents for specific technologies (e.g.,       HTML, or some other implementation strategy).          - That's how the Microsoft guidelines will evolve: general       guidelines, accompanied by technology specific complementary       documents.       - Having the UAAG 1.0 be the only thing you can conform to       is problematic.       JG: Will people want to say they conform to UAAG 1.0?      GL: I don't see that at the current time it is interesting.        I think the impetus to conformance could be applied by         outside organizations. But I don't think the impetus is        there today from vendors.      GL: I can imagine user organizations (e.g., NFB) as well        lobbying a manufacturer for implementation of the Guidelines.        Guidelines are effective for this. Clear conformance levels        would allow manufacturers who do wish to try to conform to        make appropriate decisions about how to do this.      GL: Vendors may have incentive to interpret checkpoints minimally.        That would mean that vendors might not satisfy the spirit        of the guidelines.      AG: Your prognosis is that the technology-independent statement        of the checkpoints will make conformance difficult.       GL: I think that conformance needs to be measurable and thus        you have to be very specific. Especially for an implementor        who is not an expert in the field. I think you need         technology-specific bindings to be more effective.      IJ: My prognostic is negative that we will have the time        to do the technology-specific bindings at this point.        The WCAG WG is working on this problem specifically.      GL: My comments are suggestions, and I realize that some of         them may not be realistic. If your goal is measurable        conformance, though, I don't think you can achieve it with        a document that is technology independent. Maybe it suffices        to warn the reader of the document of this.      JG: Note that we have used the document to try to determine        conformance of some user agents. The most difficult requirements        to verify are those related to communication with other        software. Did you have this feeling as well?      GL: I think that you are the wrong people to test the document        since you understand it. I compared the document's definition        of keyboard access v. yours. It was hard for me to determine        whether your definition said the same thing as mine. In some        cases, it was not clear to me which checkpoints applied to        some cases I had in my head.      GL: It would be nice to mention in checkpoints what you expect        the checkpoints to cover.      GL: Certainly, the API requirements would require platform-specific        testing tools. I don't think that your WG would be producing        those tools. It's a problem we're struggling with as well.        We are trying to develop more general testing tools. There's        a technical problem in evaluating conformance to the API        requirements. There's a definitional problem of how an        uninformed person would evaluate the checkpoints.      DP: The issues are so numerous and the applications are so broad.        There is lots of discussion on the interest group list about        how the document is not designed for those without technical        expertise.      GL: I think that in the long term, the field needs to come up        with tools that offload the verification tasks from the user,        especially the non-expert user. Tools need to make        accessible tools automatic, but we also need validation        tools that don't require expertise in order to be useful.        They need to allow a novice software tester to generate        a list of issues that can be turned into action items.    /* Rich joins */      GL: It would be interesting to have three people evaluate a         user agent (including one who is not in the WG) and see        what they come up with.      Action GL: Ask someone from Microsoft whether they will    evaluate the guidelines with a product. Deadline one week.    /* Another issue */      GL: I thought that forward navigation alone was insufficient        for minimal navigation through active elements.      JG: We hope UAs will do more, but the minimum was forward        sequential navigation.      IJ: We have two checkpoints: sequential navigation and         structured navigation (which subsumes direct navigation).        Our structured navigation relies to a large extent on the        format.        GL: Because "important elements" is not defined, is it possible        for a UA to claim conformance that doesn't meet the spirit of        it?        IJ: What would you say if I asked you (GL) if you objected        to moving forward with the current conformance stuff?      GL: I think that you should clarify that the document is        subject to interpretation.      AG: I have the same feeling as GL: this document is worth        publishing for guidelines. We will confuse people if we        say "test to this docuement" instead of "design to        this document"      GL: It would be good to have testing experience to see how to        move forward with testability in future versions.      GL: My experience is having designed guidelines in the past        and having designed standards in the past. When random        companies try to conform to a published standard, they will        ask for clarification over and over again. The only way        to deal with that in practice is to be more and more specific        in complementary materials (FAQs, etc.) and to make explicit        points that were initially implicit.      JG: I think WAI EO will be crucial to this effort.      GL: I think that the techniques document will be most        useful for developers trying to do work.      Resolved:      - We expect to test the usability of the document per this       discussion.     - We may add some verbiage to the document about "design to"       v. "test to", but that will depend on the results of our       testing.      Action IJ: Coordinate usability testing of the guidelines.    /* TL leaves */    -------------------    3.Issue 454: Checkpoints 3.6/3.7: Should these be Priority 1?    Source:  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#454      Refer to proposal from JG:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0117.html      JG: I would be more comfortable raising refresh to P1 if we    had implementation experience.      DP: Lynx lets you do manual refresh.      GL: Don't know whether IE allows user to stop auto-refresh.      DP: Yes you can lose data if the refresh rate is too short.        I've had this experience where I've been reading along and        a page was yanked out from under my feet. However, if you        don't update the page, you lose data in-between when you start        updating the page and when you actually do.      GL: Note that client-side redirect (3.6) often breaks the back        functionality. If you are on page A and you go to page B which        takes you to C, then going back to "B" may be fatal since you        are taken to C immediately.      DP: You can use the history to go back to in this case.      IJ: This problem affects everyone, doesn't seem to be just about        accessibility.      IJ: I think that redirect should be done on the server side.        Therefore, 3.6 is something of a repair checkpoint.      Resolved:     - (3.6) Redirect is P2 (author didn't intend user to see this page)     - (3.7) Refresh  is P1 (author meant user to have content).      - Clarify that 3.7 (like 3.6) is about client-side driven refreshes.       Delete "author-specified" in 3.6/3.7 and highlight "recognize"       instead.     - Clarify that 3.6 and 3.7 are about pull rather than push.     - Add to techniques to not break "back" when implementing       client-side redirect.    4.Issue 455: Guideline 4: Change to "Ensure user control of  presentation"?

      Hello,    At the 18 Jan 2001 teleconf [1], I received an action item pertaining  to issue 448 [2]. Checkpoint 5.9 in the 16 Jan 2001 draft [3] reads:        For user agents that implement Cascading        Style Sheets (CSS), provide programmatic access       to those style sheets by conforming to the CSS module       of the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style      Specification [DOM2STYLE] and exporting the interfaces       it defines.    The reviewer's question was: Does this checkpoint require  read/write access?    I conferred with Philippe Le Hegaret (the DOM WG Team contact),  and here are the facts about the CSS module of the DOM Level 2  Style Specification [4]:    a) The CSS module does not provide access (read or write)     to user style sheets. Apparently, one reason for this decision     by the DOM WG involved privacy concerns.    b) The CSS module allows authors to modify author style sheets.     c) The CSS module allows read access (but not write     access) to the computed value of a CSS property.    d) The CSS module includes a mechanism called the     "override style sheet". This style sheet is part of the      cascade (though not defined by the CSS Recommendation). It     is used for in-memory modifications to author styles; these     style changes are not saved with the DOM tree when it is written.    The two write mechanisms that are available through these   APIs are intended for authors only. Therefore, I propose:    1) That we make no changes to the checkpoint requirement to     implement the DOM 2 Style Recommendation.    2) That we add this text to the Note following the checkpoint:         User agents should not allow users to modify author       style sheets or the override style sheet through the       mechanisms of the DOM Level 2 CSS module. Similarly,       user agents should not allow authors to modify user       style sheets. See checkpoint 4.14 for more information        about user control of user style sheets.       - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0098.html  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#448  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010116/  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Style-20001113  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

IJ: I don't think that developers are required to read the Techniques  document to understand whether a checkpoint applies. However, it  may be an indispensable resource: the more experience we have  with different formats, and can compare techniques from  format to format, the easier it will be for developers to  apply the checkpoints to their situation. As long as the   checkpoints are technology independent, then a technology-specific  companion will be very important.    > >  User agent developers are encouraged surpass the minimal  > >  requirements expressed by the checkpoints and to address  > >  accessibility issues not covered by this document.

Period. Improvements for people without disabilities are  > a possible secondary effect.     IJ: I think we emphasize universal design primarily to remind  people that a more general solution may both be easier to implement,  may benefit more users, and may still meet the requirement.    Do you see any instances where we emphasize "all users" other  than as a general side-effect or way to simplify implementation?     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

IJ: I recognize the value in adding a generic "magnification"  requirement.   By adding this requirement to the spec, we move a functionality we  assumed (up to  now) was covered by screen magnifiers or by a spec itself (such as SVG).  This relates to your comment 5.    I think I would object to adding this checkpoint at this time.     > Comment 3:  >   > The idea behind the lower priority (Priority 2) is that the message in  > non-text elements is also available via text equivalent (provided the  > content in WCAG 1.0 single-A conformant); therefore it ought not be a  > Priority 1 checkpoint.

IJ: I would object (strongly) to the addition of requirements to allow  navigation  according to style. I think that this is ok to tell developers in the   Techniques document (but not great to tell them).     Style may be used to convey important information (in fact, I expect it  to  be used as much as natural language alone to convey important  information).  However, style should not be the ONLY way in which that information is  identified. Style sheets are meant to allow authors to tailor the  rendering  of important information to a particular output mode.     By requiring such a capability of browsers, we will only encourage  authors to put semantics in style first, rather than in device-  or output-independent markup and then styling that markup.   I think that it's important to:     - Encourage proper authoring practices. Refer to Guideline 3 of WCAG  (the     prose) as well as checkpoint 2.1 for example for requirements to not  rely     on style alone to convey information.   - Discourage bad authoring practices (and encoding semantics in style  alone     is a bad authoring practice, refer also to ATAG 1.0 checkpoint 4.5).   - Promote the proper implementation of specifications rather than the     implementation of features that support bad authoring. Developers  have limited     resources - let's help them use their resources to create conforming     user agents.    I would object to a "repair checkpoint" that requires navigation  capabilities according to style patterns.     > Jon's suggestions:  >   > [NEW 2]  > 7.b Allow the user to easily navigate implicitly defined important  > structural elements identified by the author.

      Hi Bruce,    I've updated the source as follows: No period after the closing  bracket (like the other [Priority N]). So I've added a period  in 8.1 at the end of the sentence and before the brackets start.    As for WCAG 1.01, ask the WCAG WG...     _ Ian      "Bailey, Bruce" wrote:  >   >Checkpoint 8.1 is missing a period, and period may be misplaced.            8.1  Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets  directly  accessible or compatible with assistive technologies [Priority 1 if  functionality is important and not presented elsewhere, otherwise  Priority  2.]   should be:            8.1  Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets  directly  accessible or compatible with assistive technologies.

Personally, I think the last period should be  INSIDE  the closing bracket (for both checkpoints), but I am no grammatician.    So, when is WCAG 1.01 coming out?

For example, an executed  script     that does a calculation and changes content but does not change the  UI.    2) Other events cause changes to the UI. Since those changes are obvious     to a user of the native UI, we don't require the UA to provide     redundant indication of the change in the UI.    3) We require that all events be broadcast through an API.     4) We make accessibility requirements on the UI, such as checkpoint     1.5, which requires that messages have text equivalents in the UI     that may be used by ATs.     5) No, we are not requiring that ATs do anything.       - Ian    > Charles MCN  >   > On Tue, 25 Jul 2000, Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   >   Hello,  >   >   In the 7 July Guidelines [1], checkpoint 9.3 (Priority 3) reads:  >   >      Allow the user to configure notification preferences for  >      common types of content and viewport changes.  >         Note: For example, allow the user to choose to be notified  >         (or not) that a script has been executed, that  >         a new viewport has been opened, that a pulldown menu has  >         been opened, that a new frame has received focus, etc.  >   >   1) Since this checkpoint does not specify that it is about notification  >      through an API (which is covered by checkpoint 5.5), our document  >      says that this checkpoint refers to notification through the  >      user interface.  >   >   2) Looking back at the history of the checkpoint  >      (checkpoint 10.2 was introduced in the 9 July 1999 draft [3]), I  >      believe that originally this requirement was supposed to apply to  >      notification through an API and notification through the UI.  >      Refer to 30 June 1999 discussion [4].

      Hello,    As per my action item of [1], here's a proposed NEW checkpoint  about form orientation based on Gregory Rosmaita's original proposal  [2].  (It resembles checkpoint 9.6 of [3], for links).    Provide information about the structure and navigation mechanisms  specified for a form. [Priority 2].     For instance, provide information about controls with explicitly     associated labels, about which keys activate the form controls,     about the serial navigation order of the form controls, and     about control groups (e.g., in HTML specified with the FIELDSET     and OPTGROUP elements).     We should also include cross-references about device-independent  activation and navigation.    Since checkpoint 9.10 deals with labels, it could be subsumed  by this proposed checkpoint. Checkpoint 9.10 reads:     Provide the user with access to any label explicitly    associated with a form control.

That does seem more flexible to me, but I have heard people argue that  accessibility through add-ons and plug-ins was not acceptable (I'm not  quoting anyone on that, however). Are there people in the WG who feel  that the browser must conform     a) without the possibility of adding software to some "core" user       agent (if such a thing exists), and    b) conformance must be based on default settings (for those parts       of conformance that are configurable)?          > 2.

      Hello,    A recent email [1] included some inflammatory language in response  to spam sent to the WCAG mailing list. To address this problem,  I propose the following actions.    1) We cease that thread immediately. Please do not continue discussions     either about the original spam or the response to it. Continuing     discussion will only cost us time and energy.    2) We change the list mechanics at W3C so that only people      subscribed to it can post to it. Subscription will be open to all.     Mail sent by someone who is not subscribed is bounced to the list      maintainer(s) who can add the person or request that they        subscribe and resend their message.    If there are no objections before the next teleconference on 16  March, I suggest that the Chairs authorize the change in list policy.    Comments welcome,     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JanMar/0397.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    As predicted, it did not take long to split the UAAG into  pieces (I did this while I was sick, since it allowed me  to kill some time...)    I have published the 11 April 2001 Guidelines [1]  and Techniques [2] for you to examine this type of   document division. There are otherwise no changes.    Links between the Guidelines and Techniques document   still work. However, links from older documents to these  versions will break.    Let me know if you find any problems or would like any  improvements. Unless there are strong objections, I hope  we can continue forward with this organization.     - Ian    P.S. Don't spend too much time on this. Gathering implementation  experience is the most important activity at this point.

IJ: Does the presence of several viewports cause an accessibility         problem?        DA: Some users with CD can only process a certain amount of visual         information. One user could play card games, e.g., as long as         there were no more than four cards in his hand. If you have too         many viewports, you may exceed the threshhold above which          processing becomes impossible.       IJ: For me, the requirement becomes the ability to close, not the         ability to prevent opening.       DA: If you have to close with looking, then it's still a problem.       GR: I don't want to have to do this by hand: I want to          configure the UA. Also, I want to ensure that configurations         are inherited and that focus is constant when a viewport is         duplicated.       JG: Sounds like minimal requirement is allowing the user to          turn off any viewport that opens automatically.       IJ: Propose issues of opening in 4.15 and issues of number in 4.16.         "Not opening" is a technique for controlling the number.        DA: You might also want a technique to limit the number.       IJ: Would being prompted cause you confusion? So is the technique         we're suggestion appropriate for the users whose needs we're          trying to address.       DA: Prompting might confuse, yes.       AG, JG: The proposed remedy would meet 4.16 as stated today.        DA: One technique: ignore "target=_new".       DA: Too much information is also a disorientation problem.         But the cause of disorientation is different.       IJ: 4.16: Allow the user to configure the number of viewports               open at one time.       DA: Techniques will be similar.       AG: I have a residual unhappiness - you're creating more         requirements. I realize that the problems aren't         the same, but if the minimal requirements are the same,         why not merge the checkpoints.       IJ: Minimal requirement for 4.15 is to prevent the focus         from moving (and let the user change it by hand, by         navigating to another viewport).          For 4.16, it's don't open new windows and don't ask.       AG: "Just say no" is not sufficient. You also need prompting         and "just do it normally". So three pieces to minimal          requirement.       AG: I think that number of viewports is an issue for blind         users, even if it's a lower priority for them.       Action IJ: Propose new 4.15 and 4.16 to list.    4) PR#244: Checkpoint 4.5: Change to P2 since no reference  implementation.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#244        MR: Refer to my email:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0065.html       MR: Part of the difficulty is to avoid distorting pitch.       JG: Variable-speed tape recorders have been doing this since the         1950's.       AG: Yes, there are techniques for doing this, although I don't         think that this has been done commercially as long as that.       JG: What's the range for slowing down? Half-speed?        HB: George Kerscher argued that below 80%, the audio becomes         almost unusual.        DA: Most of the technology I'm aware of is about speeding up.       GR: Although many blind users speed up rendering, some users who     are newly blind, or who have other disabilities, will need to slow     down as well.       GR: I don't think slowing down needs to be symmetric with speeding  up.             IJ: We can't pick numbers out of a hat. For any of these ranges,         we need to do research.       JG: Note that 4.5 does not talk about speeding up since you still         have access to content. Slower than you wish, perhaps, but         you still have access.       HB: Then it's a P2 or P3 to speed up.       JG: You may not have to do pitch adjustment at 80% speed.       JG: What about for animations and video?       HB: Will you get "beating" phenomena in the visual field?       AG: I think it makes sense to split video and animation due         to feasibility.       JG: We're not talking about compressing. We're talking about         extending the time a frame is visible.       AG: You could do dithering.       MR: I'm not aware of data on these needs.       DA: I would guess that for video or animation, half-speed would         suffice.       MR: If there is audio that goes with the video, then those         two need to be synchronized. The user needs to know that if         they slow down the video more than 80%, that the audio         may not be rendered.       JG: It would be acceptable to cut out the sound below 80%.       DA: Yes, a user could view the video without audio first ,         then replay faster with audio to get more information.       JG:        - For video / animated: slow to at least 50%      - For audio: slow to at least 80%      - When synchronized: down to 80%, must synchronized, after that,        audio can drop out.       HB: We don't need to specify a continuous range down to 50% or 80%.       Consider resolved for now (unless information contradicts our best  guess):       1) Leave 4.5 a P1.

If you want to talk about         learning theory, you're dealing with different types of         information. Research shows that transitions between modalities         can be a very difficult task. I would suggest that this         be moved to a P2.         AG: Yes, flopping back and forth between modes. The lower challenge         may be pure text or pure image. Images aren't bad, but         complexity can be bad.       IJ: A change in priority would be a substantial change to the         document. This is not a mere clarification to the document.

We lose namespace support and CSS module.        HR: What about open-ended requirement for DOM?       JG: We closed it off to make the spec tighter.       HB: I don't believe that any MS product conforms to DOM 1.       JG: MS people believe that they do.       IJ: Philippe has told me that IE's DOM is a superset of         of W3C DOM Level 1, but has not confirmed that yet.       IJ: NN 6 claims full support for the DOM.       JG: How many people consider DOM 2 critical?       GR: I am leaning towards that position. I think 5.4         (CSS module) is important.       IJ: Please be prepared to wait at least 3 extra months.       GR: We might have to wait anyway if we recycle.       IJ: We should change our strategy if we recycle so that         we can drop to DOM 1 by default if DOM 2 not a PR         after a certain point.       HR: I think DOM Level 2 important as well. The CSS module         is useful (as is the events module).       DA: I think that going for accessibility would require going         to DOM 2.       MR: I'm not informed enough about the DOM.       AG: I still believe that we should put in an explicit         implementation time out: say that you have to comply         within 6 months (for example) of the document becoming         a Rec. This is the ugly proposal.       HB: I would hate for our spec to have to wait 6 months. I'd         rather put in words about DOM 1, and do what AG says.       IJ: I think we should move to DOM 1. You would get more          accessibility sooner, then publish another UAAG later         and not break conformance to UAAG 1.0.       JG: So it sounds like:         - The WG should resolve the other issues first and get         a sense of the sum of changes.         - If we choose to recycle, we could try for DOM2.          - If we choose not to recycle, we might try DOM1 then         produce a new REC with even more of DOM2 work later on.       JG: Would anyone object to going ahead with DOM1 and creating         a new UA Rec when DOM2 becomes a Recommendation?       HR: I still prefer the solution of giving user agents a six-month         lead time.       IJ: I think that an open-ended dependency on a document that         doesn't yet exist or at least might change in unexpected ways,         is dangerous.           --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Last Call issue 111 [1] was about introducing a relative priority scheme  (for checkpoint 6.1, implement the accessibility features of supported  specifications). The issue was raised by Charles [2] in light of the  Authoring Tool Guidelines experience. The UA Working Group, at the  Austin face-to-face meeting in December 1999 [3], decided to leave this  checkpoint a priority 1 checkpoint for several reasons:      1) If user agents only implement P1 and not P2 and P3 accessibility       features, no authors will be able to use the P2 and P3 features.      2) The UA Working Group did not want to introduce a relative priority       schema for a single checkpoint, arguing that it would complicate a       system that some developers might already find challenging.      3) The WG argued that non-conformance to specifications was one of the       most important barriers to accessibility, and therefore it was  considered       a high priority to implement all, not just some, of the  accessibility       features of the supported markup languages.    While these arguments were used for checkpoint 6.1, I believe that  they also apply to checkpoint 2.1.

As Jon points out in a later email [4], we do not use the term "render"  since  content may be available through an API. There is a cross reference  from 2.1 to guideline 5 for that reason.     - Ian    [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0518.html    > [1]  > http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/uaag10.html#gl-content-access  > [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10-TECHS/#content-access  > [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/  > [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/uaag10.html#def-content  >   > [previously posted to AU in error]  >   > Phill Jenkins  > http://www.ibm.com/able    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 429-8586  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I would go further to say that this is an editorial clarification  and I will add it to the next draft (with a note that the WG has  not confirmed this proposal). Since we have not specified to date  which particular level of WCAG conformance is required, it follows  that the minimal level is WCAG Level-A.     If there is any opposition to Level-A being the minimal level  of conformance for this checkpoint, please speak up.     _ Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

This reminds me of the "Interoperable v. Stand-alone" conformance  proposal (17 Sep 1999 [1], refer also to summary of conformance  proposals [2]). That proposal was rejected because it allowed  conformance without interoperability. Gregory's suggestion takes  a different approach: a sliding priority scale to ensure  that the UA provides a necessary functionality when it doesn't  use the DOM.    The only problem: If you don't implement the DOM, you don't  conform. And that requirement is Priority 1 (today). So the  priority of a table navigation checkpoint doesn't matter and therefore  doesn't need to slide.    I raised a question at the face-to-face in Austin:  what are the criteria for deciding which functionalities belong  in general purpose user agents which should be implemented  by assistive technologies? I have published some thoughts,  entitled "User Agent Responsibilities" [3]  for consideration by the Working Group. This document does not  attempt to answer definitively the question of native support for table  navigation. I hope, however, it will serve as a support document   (after WG approval) to present our rationale on  table navigation and other requirements to the Director when we   go to Proposed Recommendation.

      Hello,    I've published the 24 February 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]  and Techniques [2]. The list of changes [3] is online and included  as text below.    This is the draft that people should be familiar with for  the face-to-face meeting in Cambridge. It includes changes to  Guideline 2 adopted at the 22 Feb meeting and a definition  of conditional content, as well as tweaks to definitions of  equivalent, text element, and text equivalent.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010224/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010224/  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html#WD-UAAG10-20010224    -------  CHANGES  -------    General     * The document talks a lot more about "conditional content" and a     lot less about "equivalents", though equivalents are still     mentioned (with respect to WCAG and also checkpoint 1.3).    Guidelines     * Prose to Guideline 2 edited to reflect staged access model.   * Prose all Guidelines edited to reflect current state of document     (after evolution of checkpoints and migration of checkpoints to     other guidelines).   * Title of Guideline 4 changed per [50]issue 455.     [50] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#455    Checkpoints     * 1.1, 1.2: Editorial clarifications.   * 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9 (new): All changed according to     [51]proposal from Ian adopted at [52]22 Feb 2001 teleconference.     This addresses issues [53]321, [54]322, [55]358, [56]359, and     [57]392.   *   * 3.3: Added a note that blinking may be useful to some users (e.g.,     users who are deaf).   * 5.4: Per [58]issue 457, deleted "usign standard APIs". Added a     cross-reference to 5.6, since it covers the standard API     requirements. Checkpoint 5.4 requires read-write access in all     cases, even when no std APIs available. Moved commented examples     to Note after checkpoint, in conjunction with cross reference to     5.6   * 8.3: Per [59]issue 458, Added statement to that the requirement     for image maps (all image maps, not just client-side) is highlight     of map as a whole, with "should" for configuration to highlight     each active region. The idea is that the author will help here.     Note: [60]objection from Charles.    Conformance    Based on [61]proposal from Ian, added text to clarify that checkpoint  groupings are not normative. This pertains to [62]issue 435.    Glossary     * Added "conditional content"   * Modifications to the definitions of text element, text equivalent,     and equivalent. Much of the information previously there is still     there, but now the definitions point more towards WCAG 1.0     definitions.    References     * Added RFC2046 (for checkpoint 2.2).    Techniques     * Checkpoints 2.1, etc.: Techniques updated since checkpoints moved     around.   * Checkpoint 2.10: Add info about HTTP headers and CSS ':lang'     pseudo-class. Also, revised this sentence "For instance, a user     agent that doesn't support Korean (e.g., doesn't have the     appropriate fonts or voice set) should allow configuration to     announce the language change with the message "Unsupported     language -- unable to render" (e.g., when the language itself is     not recognized) or "Korean not supported -- unable to render"     (e.g., when the language is recognized by the user agent doesn't     have resources to render it)."   * Checkpoint 4.4: Added note that access through two passes is     better than no access at all.        --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't agree. There's no need to require new process. You just  tell the AC during the review that document A will obsolete document  B and they agree to that or they done.     - Ian

The same reasoning applies to using color for meaning:  great, as long as you also convey the meaning through other means.    However, for the case you site, no specification ensures that users  can override the font. Browsers may do this, but the HTML spec does  not require or guarantee this. CSS describes an override mechanism,  hence the promotion of CSS.    Note that I have no objection to the above HTML in addition to CSS,  since CSS suggestions (though sadly does not require) that CSS-enabled  user agents make CSS style higher precedence in the cascade than  markup language style.    There are other reasons (not related to accessibilty) to avoid FONT and  to use STYLE or external style sheets instead, such as page/site  management.       - Ian    >  So what's the  > harm?

It sounds like Guideline 2 will be reduced significantly  by the (re)creation of a guideline for keyboard support. There  will be two checkpoints left and perhaps we should find a  different place for them.    I see Guidelines 4 and 5 as much more similar: one is about  turning features on/off, the other about values in-between. I have  been tempted to merge them but they are quite long already.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hello,    I'd like to summarize what I thought the main points were from the 31  May 2001 UAWG teleconference [1]. Please note that these   comments are my own and do not represent agreement within the UAWG.  I welcome additional observations about the meeting.    Note: The title of the email of the minutes [1] incorrectly reads "13  May" instead of "31 May". Sorry about that!  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0230    -----------------------  CONSENSUS ABOUT THE DOM  -----------------------    The AT developers on the call were enthusiastic about the DOM  requirements for content. Some minuted comments from different AT  developers:     - "If browsers implemented the DOM then we would switch. If they   build it into the browsers (and there's a convincing business   argument that we wish to support those browsers), then we will   switch."     - "As long as the DOM is not implemented cross-platform, we have   problems with it. We would be interested in using the   DOM. Checkpoints 6.1 and 6.2 are important checkpoints."     - "Right now, the majority of our access to content is through   MSAA. If the browsers take off on DOM support, we will strongly   look into support for it."     - "So far, we have been looking at the IE DOM. If the W3C DOM were   available, then we would use it."    ------------------------------------------  SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT USE OF APIS OTHER THAN THOSE OF  OPERATING ENVIRONMENT  ------------------------------------------    As of the 4 June draft [2], the UAWG has preferred the following  "cascade" of APIs for providing access to UI controls (e.g.,  checkpoint 6.4):     a) Use a W3C Recommendation where available, or      an API designed for interoperability with assistive       technologies.   b) If such APIs are broken or don't exist, use publicly      documented APIs and follow standard input/output.    [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010604/    At the 31 May teleconference, there was some disagreement about  whether any API designed for interoperability with assistive  technologies was sufficient, or whether there needed to be a  preference for standard accessibility APIs for an operating  environment *first*. [I note that UAAG 1.0 has never had an API  requirement for an operating environment API before any other.]    At least two people on the call felt that (b) was insufficient for at  least two reasons:     1) Each API is a burden for AT developers to implement. So      allowing conformance for potentially several APIs       made some AT developers nervous.     2) Requiring implementation of the standard accessibility      API of a particular operating environment means that      it is more likely that ATs will work with user agents      and other software running in the same operating       environment.    There are a few reasons why UAAG 1.0 doesn't require  implementation of a particular operating environment's  standard API:     1) It would be difficult for a W3C Recommendation      to say "You must implement this vendor-specific      API in order to conform." The current model allows      for conformance by using vendor-specific APIs      or any other API designed for interoperability      with ATs.     2) Requiring platform-specific APIs for conformance      makes conformance for cross-platform user agents      that much more difficult.    The risk cited by some of the developers on the call  was that an API might be designed for interoperability  with ATs, but not be very good, or tested, etc. I don't  think that this is a serious issue because:     1) We've never had any requirements for "good" APIs.      Even currently deployed APIs may suit the needs      of some developers more than others.     2) Each API checkpoint has two parts to it: (a) the       information that must be made available, and (b) the type      of API for doing so. I think that the APIs that some       developers feared might allow conformance while not       being truly adequate would fail part (a) before part (b).    Comments:     1) After the teleconference, Rich (of IBM) wrote [3]            "Regarding the checkpoints in guideline 6.0 but more specifically      checkpoint 6.4. If the checkpoint would emphasize the importance      of environment-specific APIs I would be satisfied with the      checkpoint."        [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0231     2) Thus, perhaps we can move forward by indicating the value      of operating environment APIs, but not requiring them for      conformance to the exclusion of other options. Some advantages      include:         a) Cross-software interoperability on the same            platform. Note: AT developers indicated that in any case,            there needs to be additional work done for each piece of            software with which the AT communicates.           b) Advantageous to both UA and AT developers to reuse             existing APIs.     3) As to the concern raised about the number of APIs that have      to be implemented: While the UAWG is aware of implementation      burdens by both browser developers and AT developers, this      has not been a fundamental criterion in how we have chosen      our requirements.    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

Is this necessary?              JG: My main concern is that people understand that the UA         pauses itself.       EH: Ok.       HB: What about breaking sync?      CMN: There are cases when you can't do anything about it,         e.g., real world events.       HB: What about auction events?      CMN: You can't slow down the real world. The requirement         doesn't apply.       GR: Auction houses notify through color changes <frown>         critical events.       --      2.6         a) Added collated text transcript        b) Moved note to checkpoint, added            "author-supplied" synch cues.

IJ: We could harmonize wording with that of 9.2. Use          "not explicitly done by the user."       DP, CMN: Yes,        GR: I think that the focus is to allow the user to configure         whether or not the UA. "Allow the user to configure         whether the user agent will automatically open a viewport,         prompt, or window.       EH: That's a new requirement.      CMN: There are other configuration issues.      GR: It's one thing to control the size/position of something       once created and another to talk about suppressing the       creation.       IJ: As I recall, we agreed in Austin to put all of it in 4.16.     CMN: I agree with Gregory - there are two separate requirements.      GR: I propose to split the checkpoint:     a) Allow the user to configure the visual rendering.     b) Allow the user to configure alert mechanisms used on opening.     c) Respect user settings when opening windows.      IJ: Sounds like three:     a) Suppress spawning AND/OR prevent focus shifting.     b) Configure alert of spawning.     c) Style the user interface.      IJ: I don't think "respect user settings" get us much.      Action IJ: Add to definition of Configure that users should        be able to save settings.       JG: How does all this relate to focus changes (4.15)?        IJ: Why are spawned windows an issue if there's no        focus change and you're notified?      GR: Yes, 4.15 and 4.16 are related.      RESOLVED:     1) MOve note after 4.16 to 4.16 techniques with some        clarification.       2) Link from 4.16 techniques to 4.15 techs.         3) Reword 4.16.

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS    Issue 43: Covered by existing checkpoints. No change to spec.  Issue 64: Keyboard mapping. No change to spec  Issue 67: Ok to add keyboard guideline and checkpoint proposed by Ian.  Issue 69: Instead of guideline, add checkpoint about consistency.      1. Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars?     (http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#3)       CMN: Yes, use MAP. Designed for that purpose.        JG: So what should UAs do with this info? E.g., direct         access to navigation material         CMN: prioritized approach for access to nav tools       Gregory: I agree.       Action Ian: Propose MAP as technique to GL     Action Gregory: Propose a technique or checkpoint                      to UAGL for what to do with                      recognized nav bars    2. Navigation and activation of elements with ACCESSKEY attributes  defined     (http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#43)       CMN: My concerns: accesskeys should not change the normal user  interface -     for example interfering with the key sequence for normal functions.  THe user     should be able to turn them off, and re-assign them.       IJ: We have a checkpoint now about turning off author-specified         bindings (Priority 2). This checkpoint to appear in next draft.       /* Charles leaves */       Ian: ACCESSKEY is HTML-specific. Includes links and form controls.          Is this just a way of saying navigate to active elements?          (Refer also to checkpoints for HTML 4.0 support and          device-independent activation of active elements.)          Propose mentioning in techniques as a way of identifying          (some) active elements in HTML.       Resolved: This issue is covered by checkpoints that address         active element activation, navigation, user control         of bindings, and documentation.       Note: Returning to default bindings is not covered.       Action editor: Add wording to checkpoint about profile                    configuration (4.1) that user be able to return                    to default profiles. And to select from among                    profiles (including the default).    3. Keyboard mapping among assistive technology tools (Issue #64).     (http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#64)       Issues: Should the guidelines include info for ATs about keyboard            configs or is this too much implementation information?       JG: Developers have told me that industry doesn't agree on this.       Gregory: As an end-user, I think we should emphasize platform            conventions for bindings. Much easier to adapt to            ATs when standard os controls are used. If AT crashes,            for example, you can shut things down in a standard            manner. Few ATs tell you about standard operating            keyboard bindings - they just tell you about their            specific functionalities/bindings. Many users therefore            don't know about Windows-specific bindings.       JG: Point to platform-specific guidelines.       Gregory mentions AT convention in Orlando. JG informs us that     Judy is invited.       HB: Some ATs intercept some events early. Is this a problem?       Gregory: Two-pronged mess: straighten out what UA developers              do, and allow os bindings to go through.         JG: "Pass-through key" can be used to deal with this.       Resolved: No change to spec since follow os conventions               exists as a checkpoint (and mentions keyboard               bindings explicitly).    4. Adding guideline related to keyboard support in user agents (Issue  #67).      (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0208.html)       New Checkpoint proposed by ian:           Provide default keyboard configuration for frequently performed         operations [Pri 3]       IJ: Seems really obvious to me.        JG: Not obvious to most developers.       Resolved: Keyboard Guideline ok.               Add proposed checkpoint (see immediately above) by ian.               In a section on testing in the techniques:                     test UA without a mouse.          5. Must the user be able to do everything with the mouse that they can  with     keyboard (Issue #68)?      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html#68       CMN Yes. with the possible exception of entering text,          which would require an Assistive technology to enable it         (ie for Dep.UA only)       IJ: Question for me: If you don't allow text input through the         mouse, do you fail checkpoint 1.1.        Action Ian: Propose to the list changes to 1.1 in wording.                    a) In checkpoint itself                    b) In note after checkpoint.    6. Proposed Guideline for software consistency (Issue #69)      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0236.html       JG: We've got a lot to do. This is a global UA issue not         strictly related to accessibility. Impact on people with         disabilities may be slightly greater. Keyboard consistency         is most important piece.       IJ: Could be a checkpoint - list important places for         consistency.       Resolved: Add a checkpoint to section on system conventions               (Priority 3) and list consistency in keyboard               defaults, user control layout, and profiles can               be reused.    7. MK Proposal on orientation to information      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0245.html        Skipped.    NEXT MEETING:            14 July. Ian will chair.

GR: A lot of sites use content negotiation to send you        to another site that tells you to get a frame-enabled        browser. This may happen with Lynx, unless you        fake your UA declaration.      CL: Not many sites use NOFRAMES to promote accessibility.      Resolved:     For 4.12 add:         a) Ensure that alt content available when turned off.         b) Important for screen reader users and some users with            some cognitive impairments.

We did indeed analyze these patterns during our redesign of  the home page and our creation of the site index. We are doing  more and more log analysis, though I don't know yet whether the  results will be made public. I doubt it, but I'll ask anyway.    The Team also receives regularly a generated list of invalid   pages that we then fix to the best of our ability. We don't  go back and fix published technical reports. That's why we have  pretty strict publication rules that includes a requirement that  documents be valid (html, xml, css).    > That could help you identify the parts of the site to highlight  > and feature prominently; for example, Jakob Nielsen puts his most  > popular "back issue" columns in bold.

Please do.     At some point I wanted to document the goals, constraints, and  experience we had doing this project. I guess I could start here.  (Note: I don't recall that the Team agreed to all of the following  points.)    1) Goal: Make people want to use the home page. To that end:      i) Make it change more frequently with useful news.         To reach this goal, we required a commitment from the         W3C Comm Team to edit the home page several times per         week. Thus, making the home page work goes far beyond         design and involves policy as well.       ii) Make it easier to use for all users.       iii) Make it look good visually.    2) Constraints:    a) The page has to conform to W3C specs, including HTML and        WCAG 1.0    b) The page should not use frames or scripts. We probably       could use frames to do some layout without dynamically       changing content, but there's a general avoidance of frames       around W3C.    c) We chose not to hire a design firm so we would have to       sweat it out ourselves. This meant lots of input from       the Team, but also the design may lack the high gloss that       graphics designers might offer.    d) We did not have a constraint that all the good bits had       to fit into the first 640x480 screenful.     3) Some experience;    a) We wanted to avoid tables for layout, but CSS floats were not     supported well-enough yet. We did not say "We are designing for     browsers X, Y, and Z only." However, there were enough problems     with floats among the browsers used by the Team that we decided it     was too soon for floats. It's probably also too soon for CSS     positioning, which is also too bad. So we resorted to tables, but     ensured that the table linearized well. We used Lynx [0]      to test this and in general used Lynx to test how the page  serialized.       We wasted a lot of time on the horizontal layout issue. It's too     bad user agents don't already support CSS1. It would have saved     us enormous amounts of time.    b) A lot of useful time was spent trying to figure out how the home     page should work. We created the site index to offload some links     (we had been meaning to create a site map or index anyway).     We also augmented "About W3C" [1] and the Activities pages [2]      significantly, so that we would not have to overload the home page     with descriptive information. We had planned a brief "About W3C"      statement on the home page but deleted it. However, readers of this     list re-recommended it, so we put it back.       A long list of links suggests that you need a mechanism so that     users with serial access can jump over that list. Since Lynx     renders the LINK element as an active link, we opted to "hide" the     jump links with a series of LINK elements. However, that solution     may not work for all user agents, and so we may need to consider     other mechanisms for jumping the A-to-Z list (and in general, links     to get to the key areas of the page: the A-to-Z list, the news,     and the second list of links inside the site).    c) Contributors to this forum clamored for the list of links to the  Activities.     Our intention in augementing the Activities page [2] was to get     delete this list from the home page and simplify it significantly.     However, since most people wanted this list up front, we had to     find a design that would include it while minimizing the fear that     a long list of links might inspire.     d) We added more links for the public to get involved (and added more     information about how to do so to the "About W3C" page [1]). We     added a direct link to translations, for example.     e) Bert Bos helped us find some CSS that would allow us to create     a navbar that had a solid color background, instead of using     text in images and image maps. So the navbar is real text characters.     We have talked about using the same navbar on different pages to     improve consistency and start giving a common look and feel to     top W3C pages. But trying to get the whole Team to adopt the     same design will take years off my life.    f) In addition to more news, we wanted to make more readily available     information about upcoming W3C appearances and past W3C appearances     (e.g., Team talks [3]). We had thought about listing all of the     future appearances on the home page only. Instead we decided that     links to upcoming events (1) should be on the relevant W3C     Activity home pages (where you would naturally go if you wanted,     say to find out about the next XML-related event) and (2)     should be listed in one place, our upcoming appearances page [4].    g) We also had long discussions about colors, always a mistake <grin>.     The Team liked setting off the boxes of links with different  background     colors. Finding the right background color also meant finding the     right foreground color. In fact, we're still working on trying to      harmonize our icons and style sheets to one "w3c blue".    We are continuing to think about how to improve the home page  (and the rest of the site). I hope people will continue to send their  constructive suggestions and criticisms. In addition to getting  public feedback, I had hoped this forum would be used so that others  would contribute their design experience and this would become  a forum for discussing design obstacles and solutions. For example,  I'd like to hear how others address the horizontal layout issue  and if there's a better solution than tables that works   with 99% of user agents today. I foresee a FAQ in our future...    Thanks,     - Ian    P.S.

In fact, from what I understand  of Charles' statements in the past, the goal is precisely to design  Web pages that allow people to choose a format that's best for them,  by 'transforming gracefully'.    However, some information encoded in today's technologies transforms  less gracefully than others, so we provide alternative formats to  convey it to different audiences.      - Ian      >   We got some pretty smart grad students here at  > Berkeley.

The statement about "extra work" has been removed in the latest draft  [1]  (available from the WAI GL home page, published 16 March)     > Unfortunately I think the accessibility guidelines have to  > take into account bugs in widely deployed browsers.    I think that tracking bugs in browsers lies outside the scope of  even the techniques document. That information should be readily  available to authors and the techniques document should list  some places where it may be found, but in my opinion, it would  (1) be difficult for W3C to list bugs in browsers produced by  Member organizations and (2) be difficult to list only bugs  in major and not all browsers (and what about assistive technologies?)  and  (3) possibly require more updates to the techniques document more  frequently than planned.     > Guidelines one gives the example "a logo in a link might be "Return to home  > page"."  The "Return to Home Page" is a bad name for an anchor, as the user  > might not have visited the home page.  I'd suggest "Go to home page".    This has also been removed from the current draft [1], and the  definition of text equivalent expanded in the glossary. There  is no example there now, and perhaps we need to reinstate it correctly.    > Checkpoint 1.1 and elsewhere gives HTML elements in capitals (e.g. IMG).  In  > the light of the XHTML document, arguably these should be lowercase??    That's an interesting point, but this document doesn't refer to  XHTML (perhaps it should). It only refers to HTML 4.0, where the c  onvention in the spec is to use uppercase names. Perhaps we should  say explicitly that this is an editing convention,   as we did in the HTML specification [2]:            Element names are written in uppercase letters          (e.g., BODY). Attribute names are written in          lowercase letters (e.g., lang, onsubmit).           Recall that in HTML, element and attribute names are         case-insensitive; the convention is meant to          encourage readability.

I don't  want the TOC to read "Section 2.1" for Guideline 2. I'd rather it  be "Section 2, Guideline 1". However, putting the word "Guideline"  in each entry of the TOC makes it kind of long, so only the  number appears there.    Suggestions welcome. We could put "G1" or something like that...

We don't specify a dark blue backround with our  style sheets. In fact, we specify a yellow / ochre background.

AND/OR     c) Get commitments from AT developers that they will         adopt these solutions.       JB: I recommend that the WG try to accomplish these goals         in 3-4 weeks. Keep up momentum. Try to move to Recommendation         as early as possible.       KB: I think CR is a good idea. Extra work now, but more convincing         to developers.       DP: What does CR add to the spec in terms of deliverables?       IJ: Definitely a deliverable. For example, collate existing         reviews to show Director what is already implemented. All         reports will strengthen our case with the Director.       JB:          a) Talked with Director who supported time frame I proposed.         b) Refer to process document for specific requirements of            what the Director expects at each request.       MR: Sounds to me that we need to do an implementation report.         If almost all are done, we can claim to be ready.       JR: You may find some documented experience even for the DOM.              MQ: PWWebSpeak doesn't rely on IE DOM.         DP: But JFW might. I know Glen Gordon has spoken to that issue         a number of times.       Action JG: Draft a preliminary implementation report.       A look at a potential schedule:        14 January to C.R.      11 February end C.R.      18 February start P.R.      17 March end P.R.      ?? April Rec.       DB: From conversations with the IE Team, I think there will be         DOM support. But I don't know        KB: What is the role of ATs in this implementation report         if the GL are for general-purpose browsers.       GR: Need to show:       a) Browsers are implementing the DOM       b) We were correct in judging that ATs could use the DOM.          E.g., what would read-only imply for ATs? (completion of          forms, e.g.)       JB: Probably want to ensure that Opera, media player developers,         etc. involved in discussions of DOM during CR.       GR: I'm a beta-tester of Opera 4. We have been claiming that         you satisfy a lot of requirements by implementing         CSS1 and CSS2. It would be good to use CR period to verify         this.       GR: Also, use CR period to verify that other user agents besides         desktop browsers can use the guidelines.       DP: How does CR get formally announced.       JB: This is new, but:       a) Announce to W3C Advisory Committee       b) Announce to WAI IG       c) Announce by UAGL to targeted community        d) Probably no press release.       GR: (About HAL): I am under the impression that the HAL         people want some kind of assurance that the solutions         will work before they commit resources.       Action IJ: Verify that "synchronized alternative"                not used elsewhere in techniques.       Action MR: Run a multimedia player through the guidelines for                January.       Action GR: Run LPPlayer through the guidelines. Verify with                 Productivity Works.  AGENDA 2.LC#138: "Synchronized equivalent" v. "Continuous Equivalent"/  Proposed       split of 2.5        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#138        IJ: How does "applicability" apply to parts of a checkpoint?         Should we split the checkpoint into smaller pieces (which         Eric's proposal suggests)? Propose "the requirement" doesn't         apply instead of "checkpoint"?       MR: Or "portion of the checkpoint".       MR: New pieces from Eric:         a) Synthesizing auditory descriptions from text.         b) Collated text transcript (excellent idea!).            You can mix captions and text equivalents of auditory            descriptions in a single file and include time codes.            But this hasn't been specified yet in a W3C Recommendation.            How do we deal with technologies that don't exist yet?       JG: Need to move to PF for technologies that don't exist yet.       MR: I thought the issues that needed to be discussed were:        a) How to rewrite UA checkpoint to make WCAG and UAGL fit.        MR: "captions" and "auditory descriptions" are all we have          today. May want to generalize.       JG: Or, update the Guidelines when the technology exists.       Resolved:        - Applicability clause covers us for combined checkpoints.         Action Ian: Include language in "applicability"                     about portions of checkpoints.       - Leave 2.6 as is as of 20 December draft since these               are known technologies. May add note to techniques               about future technologies.       - Consider EH's proposals as techniques (desirable combinations).             Action IJ: Follow up on EH's email with some comments from this  meeting.    AGENDA  3.LC#145: Why is 3.7 Pri 1 and 3.10 Pri 3? (Re: blinking and  flashing)       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#145          IJ: I think the current 3.9 is better wording for what 3.7 is            saying. Turning off scripts is a technique for stopping           content changes.         GR: I don't like the idea of the merge.          MR: Leave scripts as its own requirement since you don't know           what ugly things they may do.         KB: Rationale for 3.9:        a) Timing issue for reading content.           Resolved: 3.7 (scripts on/off) Priority 1 to account          for ugly behavior that the user agent can't detect.         Action IJ: Repropose 3.9 as a priority 1.           --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I have been struggling to find an adequate definition of  "explicit user request". An explicit user request is one where  the user agent and the user share the same expectation about the  user's intention. We have a number of requirements that only  apply when there has not been an explicit user request.    In the case of native UI controls, you can presume that the user  agent recognizes the role of the control (they are native, after  all). And, if the controls are documented (either in the user  interface directly, in help, etc.) then you can presume (barring  user error) that the user had a similar intention and  understanding.    The case of content is trickier. For instance, consider a link  with "target=new" in HTML. The user agent recognizes the effect  through markup, but the user probably does not. If the link text  is "hey, I open a new viewport", then both the user and the user  agent know, but the user agent doesn't know that the user does!   So the user agent can't suddenly conclude that this is an  explicit user request to open a viewport. If the user agent  prompts the user to confirm that they want to open the viewport,  then the user agent can presume that the user knows (because  the prompt is a native control).    I examined the checkpoints of the 25 May draft [1] to find out  which ones make requirements related to explicit user requests  that involve the UA user interface, and which involve  content. For ones that involve the UA user interface only, I  think it's reasonable to define "explicit user request."  These  checkpoints are:      3.2 Toggle audio, video, animated images.         Rationale: In this case, the user either interacts        with a placeholder, a prompt, a configuration setting,         or some other mechanism not provided by the author.        3.5 Toggle content refresh.         Rationale: Same as for 3.2.      3.6 Toggle redirects.        Rationale: Same as for 3.2.      5.1 No automatic content focus change.        Rationale: This will be done through the UA's controls.      5.3 Manual viewport open only.        Rationale: This will be done through the UA's controls.      5.7 Manual viewport close only.        Rationale: This will be done through the UA's controls.    The following checkpoints involve user interactions with content:      2.4 Allow time-independent interaction.        Comment: In this case, the note states:           "The user may explicitly complete input in many different         ways (e.g., by following a link that replaces the current         time-sensitive resource with a different resource)."      5.5 Confirm form submission.        Comment: This checkpoint already says "an explicit        user request to activate a form submit control."     ========  PROPOSAL  ========    a) Define explicit user request as follows:       In this document, the term "explicit user request" refers to     any user interaction with a <a href="#def-control">control</a>     of the <a href="#def-ua-ui">user agent user interface</a>,     where the behavior is <a     href="#def-documentation">documented</a>.    b) Change 5.5 to:         "Allow configuration to prompt the user to confirm (or       cancel) any form submission that is not caused by user       activation of a form submit control."       Question: What about when the user activates the form control     programmatically via their assistive technology?  We'd like     that to be considered explicit, but it's just as programmatic     as a form submission done through a script.  It might be hard     to tell the difference.          So, perhaps the best is just to say:         "Allow configuration to prompt the user to confirm (or       cancel) any form submission."       We've already said that this is a sufficient technique for     satisfying the checkpoint.       I realize that it may be an extra burden to have to confirm a     form submission once someone has pushed on a form submit     button, but that inconvenience is minor compared to the P2     requirement.    c) No change to 2.4.

      Hello,    I've published a new version of the UAAG 1.0 Guidelines and  Techniques based on recent edits and resolutions. I do not  expect this draft to change substantially before being sent  to last call (probably Monday).     However, there is a substantial change to the document that   deserves review, even if it does not affect the requirements (  of the document. Section 1.2 is no longer a summary of the   principles from which the guidelines derived, but a discussion of   the scope of this document. I have made every effort to rewrite this  section based on the following:     a) The previous introductory text had become "stale" with      respect to changes made to the guidelines. As written, it      added little to the document and even seemed to get in the      way of the guidelines, which are much improved.     b) We resolved at the 12 October teleconference [3] to incorporate      some edited version of what Eric and Jon have written      about the scope of the document. The new section 1.2 is the       result of this resolution.     c) The parts of the old section 1.2 that did not simply summarize      the guidelines, notably those parts about installation, have      been preserved and seem more in place in the new 1.2.    I would like to move this document to last call with only  editorial changes from this draft. However, if anyone has violent  objections to 1.2, please speak up before Monday 1pm Eastern Time.  I will attempt to integrate small editorial changes (typos,  small bug fixes) before going to last call. For more substantial  editorial proposals, please send them to the list, but I don't  think they will be incorporated until version of the document  after last call (and if they are editorial, it won't hurt if they   wait). I will make available shortly the list of changes [4] in   this version.    Thank you,     - Ian    NOTES:   a) You may not have access to the documents immediately. This      is due to W3C mirroring.   b) I haven't done any external link checking on this document;      I will before going to last call.

Here's why it doesn't say that today: we never have before.  We added the functional requirements of overlap/non-overlap  to clarify the not-in-same-viewport case.

      29 June 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Ian Jacobs (Chair/Scribe)   Gregory Rosmaita   Dick Brown   Tim Lacy   Mickey Quenzer   David Poehlman   Eric Hansen    Regrets:     Jon Gunderson   Kitch Barnicle   Eric Hansen   Mark Novak   Jim Allan    Absent:     Harvey Bingham   Charles McCathieNevile    Next meeting: 6 July.    Regrets: EH (maybe).      Agenda [1]  [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0522.html    Summary of resolutions:      1) For checkpoints in Guideline 3, it would seem that        "turn on/off" means at least "allow the user to configure the        user agent so that content type X is not rendered on loading."       For example, this may suffice for blinking content as an       accessibility solution. More may be required for other content       types, but we didn't get far in the discussion.    Summary of new actions:      1) Ian will produce a new draft that folds minimal requirements       into the checkpoints. Should be ready about 7 July.      2) Ian will pick up GR's action item to send out a request       for information on speech synthesizer mins/maxes for        various articulation capabilities (as we did for speech       rate).    1) Eric Hansen's proposal to make checkpoints express     minimal requirements directly.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0508.html       /* IJ explains EH's proposal, since EH not yet on the call */       GR: I think there's a middle ground. There are checkpoints where         you can roll the min req into the checkpoint and make it clear.         But what if people think we are being too specific.       IJ: Resolves a number of issues for me:      a) Where to put the min reqs? A: They are the checkpoitns.           b) What is the normative status of the Notes? A: Checkpoints         normative, notes informative.       DP: Checkpoints shouldn't be to long.       IJ: I propose to do a draft with min reqs built-in.       Action IJ: Put out a new draft in a week.     2) Single key (10.5) from Kitch     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0433.html       DP: I have an overall question: how specific do we get?        GR: Single-key should not be limited to "do this thing". They     should also be able to "put me in this mode". So, for example,     arrows always do conceptually the same thing. The same range of     ten can be used for different modes.       TL: This is a topic that we've discussed at great length         in MS. IE is restricted to single key anyway. Within the         browser window, the concept of up/down and left/right doesn't         really exist.       TL: Three things would have to happen:     a) You'd have to expose what kind of container you're in.     b) You'd have to expose what keystrokes are available.     c) You'd have to provide a programming language to allow         and end user to map strokes to events on the fly.       MQ: I'm concerned that we may leave some functionalities out,         though I like the list.       IJ: This is hard one since it involves user preferences. Also,     two sets of values to choose from: functionalities and input     resources (e.g., number of keys). I have fears about having a     concrete list of functionalities, although I agree that we may     have to end up with that as the minimal requirement.       No resolution.       /* MQ Leaves */    3) PR#287: Proposed clarification to checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, 3.6     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#287       In particular, this proposal:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0496.html        This satisfied my action from last week:     Action IJ: Propose a new 4.6 with deleted 3.3, 3.5, 3.6.       /* We did not discuss the proposal, but turned immediately to the        question of what "turn on/off" means */       Discussion of turning on and off:       a) Does this mean globally, by configuration?     b) Does this mean on a piece-by-piece basis once rendered?       Resolved:      i) Turn on/off means at least "don't render globally, allow         configuration of this setting." It's an "on load"-level         configuration.       ii) Background audio means "on-load" audio.       TL: The second piece is tricky: it assumes that items are         selectable. It also assumes that you would know enough         about the object to decide whether to turn it on (off).         From a technical standpoint, if you can navigate to it,         you should be able to activate it. So technically possible,         in my opinion. The problem is activating 100 wave files before         getting the one you want.       IJ: Breakdown of requirements:       a) Never on (resolved above).          GR: But you may want one media type (e.g., real audio)              and not another (e.g,. wave).          IJ: We haven't had mime-type level selection as a               requirement.          GR: User agent could prompt user to load.       b) Once on, allow me to turn off.       c) Turn off, then on again.       d) Global or individual level?       /* Eric Hansen joins from a New Jersey rest stop! */       EH: Cross these axes with audio/video/tactile tracks...       IJ: For example, I could see that blinking should be P1 to            turn off statically. But audio and video are different.       a) background images:         EH: What is a "background image"?        IJ: Other content is rendered "in front of it", towards the            user. This applies to multi-layered presentations as well.        EH: Is it just the image in the "way back"? Every layer needs            to be controlled, except the one in the front.        GR: If the UA supports multi-layering, that becomes a            requirement.        EH: So every supported layer needs control. The user needs             to be able to determine what is distracting. So users            need to be able to turn off about every layer. An            interesting technique would be to present layers adjacent,            as thumbnails.        TL: I can think of cases, with style sheets, to determine            what the background image is. If you define the simple case            where the lowest z-order is the background, you have to            check every time. I think that if you say that the UA has            to disable the background, that should cover the most            important cases.        DP: Applicability can be invoked here.        TL: If markup says "this is the background", that's easy.        IJ: What do you render in place of a background image?         GR: You get whatever would have been rendered without the            background image...        IJ: Do we say that for any layer below the topmost layer,            you need to render the default background in its place.       b) moving visual track (video, animations):       c) blinking content:           - global setting, don't blink, render static             content instead. P1       d) scripts, redirects.       e) images    [ITEMS BELOW NOT DISCUSSED]    4) Min / Max requirements for speech synthesis rates. Refer to     Gregory's proposal:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0482.html    5) Multimedia definitions.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0517.html     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0520.html     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0503.html    6) Checkpoint 7.5: Proposed search minreq: case-sensitive forward.    7)  Checkpoints 6.1, 8.1, 2.7, 8.2, and 8.3      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html     8) Other minimal requirements part of issue PR#257 (No proposals)       a) "Easy access": 10.8, 2.3       b) Checkpoint 10.4: Input configuration       c) Checkpoints 4.13 and 4.14: selection and focus highlight       d) Checkpoint 9.3: Configuration of notification.    Open Action Items:      1) IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers.             (No deadline.)      2) GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples           in the techniques document.      3) GR: Pursue speech synth ranges for other properties than            speech rate.            GR: Pending. Trapped on my machine.       Actio IJ: Send out message to various people asking for                 range information.      4) GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and           see whether they can be clarified to account for control           of rendering of audio (and possibly other content) on load.    Dropped Action Items:      1) CMN: Propose a technique that explains how serialization plus              navigation would suffice for Checkpoint 8.1.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    In response to the resolution of issue 404 [1] to include a  requirement to allow access to the full range of values if  text decorations are used to distinguish text, I propose the  following definition of "text decoration".       In this document, a "text decoration" means any stylistic      effect that the user agent may apply to visually rendered      text that does not affect the layout of the document      (i.e., does not require reformatting when applied or      removed). Text decoration mechanisms include underline,     overline, and strike-through.     - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#404  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I think your comment assumes two things:    a) That the HTML WG in conjunction with WAI input knew everything that     had to be done. I don't think this was the case.     b) That rendering of NOFRAMES information, whatever the element  contained,     would suffice to create an equivalent browser experience. Nothing     guarantees that in the HTML 4.0 spec and since the spec doesn't     say anything about rendering (besides when, and even that has led     to confusion), I don't think one can rely on consistent behavior     from user agents.    This is not to say that NOFRAMES is a bad idea or should not  be used.

I don't think the situation is the same - longdesc semantics are  not required to achieve as much as NOFRAMES semantics. Authors needn't  do nearly as much to make a long description useful for an image.  I think they have to think a lot more about making frames accessible,  and thus, it's not cut and dry to just say "use NOFRAMES".     How about this language as a quick tip:      Title frames and provide NOFRAMES equivalents.

Hi Martin,    Some followup on your comments.     The first comments you make refer to a checkpoint, since deleted,  on rendering according to natural language. At the face-to-face  meeting in December, we decided to delete the checkpoint since  we felt that "proper I18N rendering" was not an accessibility  issue. Refer to issue 140.    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991209#issue-140    In fact a comment you made after some clarifications seems to  suggest the same opinion:       > But I'm not sure how much that makes sense in view of     > accessability.    Thank you for your detailed comments about handling I18N  markup and HTTP information. This should be integrated  into a set of I18N guidelines for user agents.     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The note in the checkpoint says it does.

Not one of performance where you might want to stop the  processor from handling video). If the caption is part of the video  (i.e., a single track with both), I don't know how you could still  have the captions if you turn off the video. If there are separate  tracks, you should be able to view captions alone.     > Checkpoint 4.5: Allow the user to slow the rate of audio, video and  > animations  >   > In the case of animations, does this mean a requirement to step through or  > slow the speed as well as being able to turn it off? (My own thought is  > yes - if there is content in an animation it is important to step through  > it).    Yes. One question: do you think it's a violation of a spec (e.g.,  GIF) to control the rate of the animation? Note that our applicability  clause would cover this case; the user agent doesn't have access to  the properties of the content (i.e., might not be able to regulate the  speed).       > CHeckpoint 7.2: For user agents that offer a browsing history mechanism,  > when the user returns to a previous viewport restore the point of regard  > in the viewport.  >   > In a timed presentation does this mean return to the time that the user  > was at (where possible - it wouldn't necessairly work in live streaming  > for example)    If the technology doesn't allow, then the requirement wouldn't apply.

(Actually, if it means use W3C specifications  > does it mean exclusively, or does it mean include handlig of those?)    I think it's both. I propose this clarification:       "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are       available and appropriate for a task."    We could drop the conformance part, but the whole reason we're  pushing them is that they promote interoperability and have  accessibility  built-in. If you don't conform, what's the point? I do recognize that  conformance is hard in some cases. It makes that the conformance part  is P2.     As to the exclusive part, I don't think that's implied. However, for  checkpoint 11.1 we do make the clarification that there must be "at  least one"  version of the documentation that's accessible. We might make a similar  clarification in the checkpoint or a note after.       > Checkpoint 10.7: Allow the user to configure the User agent through a  > profile  >   > It is not clear what the minimum satisfaction is - allowing the user to  > configure their name?

A couple of ideas:    1) Demote to P3 and the text as is.  2) Identify the key requirements, for example presentation and input     configuration.     >   > Checkpoint 8.4: Make available to the user information that will help the  > user decide whether to follow the link.  >   > Does this mean make available all the information the tool has?

I propose the following clarification:    1) I think "a default input configuration" makes more sense than  "default     input configurations" since there is only one default. Even if  several     modes may be covered (voice, keyboard, etc.), there's still only      one default input configuration.    2) Every browser comes with a default configuration. What are we     requiring exactly?       I propose that         a) Either we drop this checkpoint, or      b) We make the requirement much more specific. For example:         "Ensure that the default configuration allows the user to  navigate          content and user interface controls simply, obviously, and          quickly."      - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Minor editing:      In choosing priority levels for checkpoints, the Working Group has    assumed that "the author" is a competent, but not necessarily expert,    user of the authoring tool, and that the author has no prior knowledge    of accessibility. For example, the author is not expected to have     read all of the documentation but is expected to know how to turn    to the documentation for assistance.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hi David,    Thank you for the very useful comments. I'm taking into account  almost all of the editorial suggestions. For the comments about  content, my replies below preceded by IJ. Your comments   are preceded by *dp*.    Question 1)     5.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video. [Priority 1]            Techniques for checkpoint 5.3            *dp* <question> what is the justification for this?     IJ: I believe that the idea here is that video may be distracting       and that some users may want to turn it off. There may also       be bandwidth issues and one would want to turn off video in order       to get, say audio or captions more rapidly.    Question 2)      5.11 Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned windows.        [Priority 1]            *dp* <question>  What happens if a window is not              spawned and that action predicates something that             must be done by the user such as filling a form?      IJ: I agree that could be a problem, but the same might be        said for scripts that are turned off but that perform        some vital function. Authors shouldn't write pages that        way.          I've just written a proposal to delete this checkpoint        in any case since I believe it's intention is covered        by a later checkpoint. Refer to [1]          [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0185.html    Question 3)     5.12 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of frames. [Priority  2]         *dp* <question> similar to above?                  IJ: Refer to issue 76 [2]            [2]  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#76    Question 4)     5.13 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified page forwards            that occur after a time delay and without user intervention.            [Priority 3]            For example, when turned off, offer a static link to the  target            resource instead.            *dp* <question> is this not a wcad issue with             regard to what is rendered or can the ua make this call?       IJ: I believe that it's a UA issue.    Question 5)       10.3 Allow the user to configure the user agent for notification of            certain types of document changes only. [Priority 3]            *dp* <Lang>  This is unsettling to me.  I feel it should be  differently put because it doesn't convey exactly what is meant or what  I percieve it to mean.  I'd like this to allow me to have the  opportunity to pick one or several from a list of things I want to be  notified about? It has something to do with the word only.           IJ: I see your point. What about something like this:        Allow the user to configure the user agent for notification      of specific types of changes from a predefined set.

"The World Wide Web Consortium was created in October 1994       to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by      developing common protocols that promote its evolution       and ensure its interoperability"    We have intentionally moved a long description of what W3C does  to a separate page (http://www.w3.org/Consortium) because most  of the users who sent comments about our home page said that they  were most interested in rapid navigation to key pages. You are  encouraged to read the public archives of comments [1].

I'm not that interested  in giving the full picture of W3C on the home page.     I think that we need more eductational materials in general  to convey to the general public what W3C's mission and deliverables  are.

There are several important reasons to have Member-related links  on the home page:    1) So that people who work for a Member organization but have not  yet participated in W3C Activities may find their way into the Member  site (hence, a link to the Member home page and a link to information  about joining W3C).    2) To attract new Members (hence, Join W3C)    > It merely confirms a feeling of exclusion for most visitors.

More implementation information:    Amir Herzberg (who is part of the W3C Micropayments Markup Working  Group) informs me that for "NewGenPay Micropayments Wallet" [3]:      "...[the] user can configure a pop-up confirmation      for payments over a user defined amount."     (I hope to get a URI to online documentation of this feature.)    That makes two implementations (see earlier on this  thread) of a payment system that illustrates configuration to   confirm payments.     - Ian    [3] http://www.newgenpay.com/     > > [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0430.html  > > [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#420    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Al,    Our mandate is to create for user agent developers  a set of requirements known to improve accessibility.   Each requirement must have a known impact on accessibility,  otherwise we have exceeded our charter.     One of the ways in which the last call UAAG 1.0 ensures that  requirements are relevant to accessibility is to "bind"  the accessibility impact within definitions. This, I believe,  is the essence of the debate we are having on the terms  equivalent, text element, etc. These terms have build-in  accessibility implications, which seems to be the heart  of your objection. So "text equivalent" means more than   "B is made of text and equals A", it means "B is understandable  to users with disabilities because of the following assumptions,  and B equals A". If WCAG talks about "text equivalents" and they  are not accessible to users with disabilities, what's the point  of talking about them? WCAG won't have done its job if its  requirements don't promote accessibility. UAAG is in the  same boat.    It is possible to remove the access portions from   the definitions of equivalent, text element, text equivalent,   etc. However, there are immediate implications to using the  same words without the accessibility binding. If document A is   the French translation of document B, they can be functional  equivalents. But is it within the scope of UAWG charter  to require user agent developers to provide easy access  to translated materials?     Questions:     - Do you think that we need to ensure the binding of each     requirement to one or more accessibility issuse?     - If we change the definitions, where do you think we could     best "recapture" the bindings to accessibility?

So what are our options?    1) Render the content by ignoring all markup. This may cause     confusion as well since all structure is lost.    2) Render alternative content (or primary content for that matter)     according to the rendering instructions of the markup language.     This won't work for HTML or XML applications.    3) Require that the user agent implement a default style sheet     for any markup language it supports. What should that style sheet     be? We don't have a standard one for XML applications. One that comes     to mind will present the content according to the structure of the     document, which takes us back to the source view.    4) Require that the author supply a style sheet for all types of  content.     I don't think this helps either the author or the user.    My fear is that we are going to try to define a line for what is  considered  accessible rendering. How do you determine that a user agent (even  a mainstream browser) has rendered content above that line? Where do you  draw that line?    I think it does make sense to say that the *minimal* requirement  is to make the document source available. (I can't think of anything  less than that, hence minimal).     Where do you draw the line after the minimal requirement?     - Ian    > On Sat, 25 Mar 2000, Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   >   Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >   >  >   > I don't think that providing a source view solves the problem.

What particular accessibility issues do they raise?  What distinguishes those subjects from Architecture or Philosophy  or Art History?    I could see adding a checkpoint to the guidelines that reads  something like:     "Where it's possible to mark up content (for example    mathematical equations) instead of using images,     use a markup language."    Then, in the techniques document, one could talk about  using MathML to mark up math content.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

The WCAG was first organized into three parts, then two:  (1) graceful transformation and (2) navigation and comprehension.   Rather than break the guidelines into two sections, we simply  described the two topics in the introduction and made the guidelines  a single list. Why have I liked this?    1) There used to be two introductory sections, at the beginning    of each set of guidelines. By pulling out the introductory text,    we make that information easier to access for those who want it    and easier to skip for those who want to get right at the guidelines.    2) I have found using a single list much more straightforward than     two separate lists. When it comes down to it, it doesn't matter     to me that guideline 3 is in the "graceful transformation" half     of the guidelines. The association is lost to me as I actually use  the     guidelines because it doesn't matter at that level. What does     matter is the guideline text, rationale, and checkpoints.       Thus, as you say, structure is important when differences exist.  However, I don't think that in this case the structure should  be reflected by the table of contents.     Being able to refer to a guideline by a simple integer is  very useful. Of course, the guidelines could be numbered   1 - 20 with 1 to 10 in Section 2 and 11 to 20 in Section 3   (or whatever section numbers), but I still think the division  is unnecessary in the table of contents.      - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Telephone May 1999 only:     (212) 688-4489  Cell phone May 1999:         (917) 450-8783  Otherwise Tel/Fax:           (212) 684-1814

      Hello,    Per my action item from the 16 November 2000 face-to-face at  AOL [1], please consider the following new Priority 1  checkpoint to address issue 327 [2]:    <NEW>  For an API implemented to satisfy requirements of this document,  support the character encodings required for that API.      Note: Support for character encodings is important so that   text is not "broken" when communicated to assistive    technologies. The DOM Level 2 Core Specification   [DOM2CORE], section 1.1.5 requires that the DOMString type   be encoded using UTF-16.   </NEW>    ----------------------------  For the Techniques document:  ----------------------------    1) For Java v 1.3, there is a list of encodings [JAVA13] that any     conforming implementation must support is: US-ASCII,     ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-16.    2) MSAA relies on COM, which relies on Unicode,     so support UTF-16 in practice. From COM documentation:     "Finally, and quite significantly, all strings passed through    all COM interfaces (and, at least on Microsoft platforms, all    COM APIs) are Unicode strings. There simply is no other    reasonable way to get interoperable objects in the face of    (i) location transparency, and (ii) a high-efficiency object    architecture that doesn't in all cases intervene    system-provided code between client and server. Further, this    burden is in practice not large."

I think we are talking about two kinds of access:   1) Access through the user interface   2) Programmatic access.    For case (1), the guideline that requires device-independent  access to all functionalities offered by the user interface  should suffice.     For case (2), one can distinguish access to the document structure  from control of the user interface proper. I am forwarding the  idea that these guidelines should not address programmatic  control of user interface controls. It would certainly be  interesting to have programmatic control of *everything*, but   attempting to achieve that would grind the process of producing  these guidelines to a halt. Broad checkpoints such as "Ensure that the  user interface follows principles of accessible design" do  not belong in this document for similar reasons: we should limit  ourselves as much as possible to addressing the accessibility of  the content.    As I've mentioned in an earlier email, we do address the user  interface in several ways:      - Device-independence (access to functionality, as well        as installation, configuration, and access to help)    - Keyboard access    - Accessible electronic documentation formats    - Configuration profiles    Thus, user interface issues do appear in the document. However,  I think trying to limit where they appear will enable us to  move forward more rapidly.     > The mandate of the group is to create guidelines for user agents to provide  > access to the web for persons with disabilities.  It would seem that the  > browser controls fall well within that mandate.     I still feel as though general user interface accessibility  issues lie outside the scope of this document.   Here's a quote from Chuck Opperman from the MIT face-to-face  meeting minutes (11 Dec 1999) [1]:       <BLOCKQUOTE>     This is a very difficult problem: making a user     interface and one that's accessible. Not     the goal of this group (making content accessible).      There are plenty of good references about how to make      an interface accessible.     Don't ignore the issue, just don't want to spent a lot of      time on this issue. Use platform guidelines.      Let's worry about HTML-specific issues.     </BLOCKQUOTE>    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-f2f-19981211.html#minutes    Apparently this is an issue that needs resolution at the  next teleconference.      >  To suggest an extreme case,  > suppose a browser were to implement all of the suggest methods of  > controlling web content, but were to implement them in a way that made the  > use of AT to access those controls impossible?   > For example, suppose the  > keyboard controls provided were implemented by reading the keyboard  > directly, so that there were no hooks for alternative keyboards to control  > the program.

We should try  our best to promote what's right and indicate what's  the wrong way to do something, but we cannot prevent someone  somewhere from doing the wrong thing.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

      Al,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed your  last call issues (321, 340-359, 462). The issues list [1]  is available online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions  are available in the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].    Please indicate whether you are satisfied with the UAWG's  resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment.  Refer to section 5.5.2 of the 8 February 2001 W3C Process  Document [3] for information about requirements to formally  address issues prior to advancing to last call.    On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and  comments,     - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call    ---------------------------------------------  The UAWG disagreed with you on the following:  ---------------------------------------------     #351: Conformance: Definition of priorities not consistent with WCAG         definitions           UAWG: We don't have new data that leads us to think that a         change is necessary. Refer to minutes of AOL face-to-face         meeting:           http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-351     #462: Merging checkpoints related to automatic refresh (3.5) and         redirection (3.6)         NOTE: See checkpoints 3.5/3.6 in 9 March draft.           UAWG: At their 8 march 2001 teleconf, the UAWG decided that         there wasn't sufficient evidence to justify merging          these checkpoints at this time.                  Minutes of 8 March 2001 telconf:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0357    ---------------------------------------------  The UAWG agreed with you, but please confirm:  ---------------------------------------------     #345: Checkpoint 1.1: Is requirement concrete and observable?            UAWG: Checkpoint simplified (no longer about APIs but               about input devices). Also, for conformance,                keyboard operable always required, mouse and                pointing device required unless claim indicates                lack of conformance.           Refer to minutes of AOL face-to-face meeting for more info:         http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-345     #349: New requirement for support for deprecated features (currently         informative in 6.2)         NOTE: See checkpoint 8.2 in the 9 March draft.           UAWG: The WG (at the AOL face-to-face that you attended)         did not add a requirement for support of deprecated features         but instead put the following in the Techniques document:             "For reasons of backward compatibility, user agents should           continue to implement deprecated features of           specifications. Information about deprecated language           features is generally part of the language's specification."    -----------------------------------------  The UAWG answered the following questions:  -----------------------------------------     <RELATED>   #321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of checkpoint 2.3   #346: Checkpoint 2.4: Proposed split: merge part with 2.3,          leave 2.4 as synchronization requirement   #358: Definition: Equivalent   #359: Definition: text content (incompatible with WCAG?)   </RELATED>           UAWG: Refer to improved Guideline 2.      #347: Checkpoint 3.2: Is silent/invisible rendering really desirable?          What is definition?         NOTE: See checkpoint 3.2 in 9 March draft.           UAWG: Define "render" to mean "make available to the user         through a viewport".     #350: Checkpoint 7.3: Is this really different from 7.4?         NOTE: See checkpoints 9.2 and 9.7 in 9 March draft.           UAWG: Two differences: the requirements differ in both         priority and the set of elements that may be included          in the navigation set.     #352: Checkpoint 8.4: Must outline view be navigable?         NOTE: See checkpoint 10.4 in 9 March draft.               UAWG: No. The purpose of the checkpoint is context         provided by an outline. The outline should also be         navigable, but this is not the minimal requirement.     #357: Conformance: Problematic applicability provision re: content         properties          NOTE: See section 3.2 in 9 March draft.           UAWG: This has been rewritten to focus on how information         is encoded in formats:           "The checkpoint requires control of a content property that the         subject cannot recognize because of how the content has been         encoded in a particular format."    --------------------------------  The UAWG adopted your suggestion:  --------------------------------     #340: Editorial: Use "refer to" for references, otherwise "see" for         informative cross-refs.     #341: Editorial Checkpoint 2.7: Clarification to checkpoint wording         NOTE: See checkpoint 2.10 in the 9 March draft.     #342: Editorial Checkpoint 3.7: Clarification to checkpoint wording         NOTE: See checkpoints 3.5/3.6 in the 9 March draft.     #343: Editorial: Checkpoint group header for multimedia          checkpoints v. continuous-time         NOTE: See Guideline 4 in the 9 March draft.     #344: Conformance: Delete reference to Internet Media Type.     #348: Editorial: Selection, focus, point of regard     #353: Checkpoint 8.2: Don't use color alone should be a requirement.         NOTE: See checkpoints 10.2, 10.3, and 10.6 in the 9 March draft.      #354: Checkpoint 7.5 editorial: Clarify usage of point of regard /         viewport         NOTE: See checkpoint 9.8 in the 9 March draft.     #356: Editorial: "Scope" v.

      Summarizing:     - The proposal was "don't do the refresh"   - Charles says that's too restrictive, since the UA might     do the refresh and provide the user with a useful diff     on demand.    I still support the proposed change for the following reason:     a) The user need is stability.   b) The minimal requirement is "don't make the change unless      the user says it's ok"   c) Charles' proposal goes beyond the minimal requirement that      I believe the checkpoint was meant to accomplish.    (It would seem that the proposed change is not editorial.)    I propose therefore that the minimal requirement is   "don't do the change unless the user says ok" and that the  checkpoint be changed to reflect that.    The user agent can do more (e.g., provide useful diffs on demand),  but I don't believe that's ever been the intention of the   checkpoint.     - Ian    Charles McCathieNevile wrote:  >   > OK...  >   > My assumptions:  > The point of the checkpoint is to keep the page stable if the user  > desires.

      Hello,    Per my action of the 1-2 March face-to-face meeting [1],  please consider the following Guideline splits. These will  appear in the next draft for review in context.    1) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft:      Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering and viewport                 behavior.    Split into:      Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering.    Guideline 5. Ensure user control of user interface behavior.    Guideline 5 is the result of the decision to group  checkpoints about user control over UI behavior under  one heading. These (abridged) checkpoints are:       5.1 Allow configuration so that the current focus does         not move automatically to viewports that open without         explicit user request.        5.2 For graphical user interfaces, allow configuration          so that the viewport with the current focus remains "on         top" of all other viewports with which it overlaps.        5.3 Allow configuration so that viewports only open          on explicit user request.       5.4 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm          any form submission not caused by explicit user         request to activate a form submit control.         5.5 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to          confirm any payment resulting from activation of a          fee link.       5.6 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to          confirm any viewport that closes without explicit          user request.    QUESTION:      Should Guideline 4 read: "Ensure user control of rendering and    styles" since there a style sheet checkpoint as well?    2) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft:       Guideline 5. Observe operating environment conventions and                  standard interfaces.    This guideline has started to grow large and there's a clear  division of checkpoints into "things for APIs" and "things  related to observing conventions". Therefore I propose splitting  it into:       Guideline 6. Implement standard application programming                  interfaces.     (10 checkpoints, all about APIs)       Guideline 7. Observe operating environment conventions.     (4 checkpoints)    Note: I don't mind having 12 Guidelines (not as good as 10,  but better than 11... and even dozen!)     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010224/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The same reasoning applies to using color for meaning:  great, as long as you also convey the meaning through other means.    However, for the case you site, no specification ensures that users  can override the font. Browsers may do this, but the HTML spec does  not require or guarantee this. CSS describes an override mechanism,  hence the promotion of CSS.    Note that I have no objection to the above HTML in addition to CSS,  since CSS suggestions (though sadly does not require) that CSS-enabled  user agents make CSS style higher precedence in the cascade than  markup language style.    There are other reasons (not related to accessibilty) to avoid FONT and  to use STYLE or external style sheets instead, such as page/site  management.       - Ian    >  So what's the  > harm?

I thought the checkpoints would be too long in some cases.

We have already considered it once and decided   to keep it (refer to issue 317 [1]).     This exception clause seems, on the surface, entirely reasonable:  if you cannot do something because a format does not allow it, you  are not required to do it.    One way to narrow the scope would be to indicate which checkpoints  to which this provision is meant to apply.       - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#317    > --  > Usage in headers.

I don't think this is a contradiction. I think that "important special  case" means that a concept deserves its own checkpoint, but I don't  think that it's related to priorities.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

My comment about our priority definitions not referring to the   responsibilities of authors is an important one. The user agent  cannot remove all access barriers alone; the author must contribute.  The definition of P1 is:      "This checkpoint must be satisfied by user agents, otherwise one     or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible    to access the Web. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic     requirement for enabling some people to access the Web."    Substituting:     "The user agent must emulate all mouse behavior through the    keyboard, otherwise one or more groups of users with disabilities    will find it impossible to access the Web."    I don't agree with the substitution since the "otherwise" doesn't  work for me; even if the UA emulates/repairs, one or more   groups of users will still find it impossible to access the   Web (as described below). The author's contribution is crucial   here, and that's not captured in our priority statement.     - Ian      > I like thje way the proposal is worded, since it makes it clearer just what  > must be done in each situtation, but I disagree that it is a priority 3  > requirement.  >   > Charles McCN  >   > On Wed, 21 Feb 2001, Jon Gunderson wrote:  >   >   Ian,  >   I like the reasoning behind the proposal.

Hi Jutta,    1) I am uncomfortable with a definition that begins "Web content is  content..."    2) Also, "Web content consists of the information" is followed by     "Web content information refers to the message". So, by transitivity,     is content the message?    3) I don't think you need to consider the message of information     as part of content.     I find these definitions a bit unwieldly. Can we tweak yours and the  WCAG 1.0 definitions as follows:    a) Web content is information published on the Web or an Intranet     and viewed by a Web browser. Authors represent information     in a variety of ways on the Web, including through natural      language, images, sounds, movies, animations, etc.     b) The structure of Web content refers to its logical organization     (e.g., by chapter, with an introduction and table of contents,      etc.).     c) The presentation of Web content refers to the way it     is output to the user (e.g., as print, as a two-dimensional     graphical presentation, as an text-only presentation,      as synthesized speech, as braille, etc.)        - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I think the techniques should be separated from the checkpoints  and guidelines, preferably in another document, but at least  after the checkpoints and guidelines. Too much detail inline  will distract readers from the flow of more abstract discussions.    One reasons to create a second document is to save download  and printing times. The Web Content Guidelines alone  are about 20 pages. The Techniques document is almost 50.

Two checkpoints relate to this:           8.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying            (through a standard interface where available) the             current viewport, selection, and focus.

Older screen readers may have problems with side-by-side text, it's  true. (I will try to get some data about this.)    Meanwhile, checkpoint 5.3 [1] in the WCAG 1.0 reads:       5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the          table makes sense when linearized.     This table makes sense when linearized (for example, check out  with Lynx).

Visit meeting page:         http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/ua-meeting       JG: We will have a bridge available for call-ins, but         attendance preferred.       MQ: I'll be attending by phone. Should I register anyway?       JG: Yes, please register. We'll filter afterwards.       IJ: I'll update meeting page when I have more information         about hotels, etc.       JG: Recommended to fly to Dulles, closer to meeting.    Discussion    1. Possible bug w.r.t. DOM requirements. Started with request from GR     to raise priority.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0110.html       IJ: Proposed to raise 5.7 to P1, otherwise ATs will not have      access to style information through the DOM.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0123.html       IJ: The question is, if a user agent doesn't support CSS, it may     still need to implement the CSS module since otherwise ATs won't     have access to all content.       /* IJ calls Arnaud LeHors */       IJ: ALH says that the Core module gives you access to the whole     content. You can query elements for a style attribute and you have     access to the style sheet as a string. Therefore, access to content     is possible without the Style module.       /* IJ reviews arguments why CSS2 module beneficial but not         critical: AT will have to compute much anyway */       Resolved: No change to checkpoint 5.7 priority (P3)               since access possible through the Core Module               generically.         GR: I think that there's a resource problem for AT developers     in having to implement CSS. I think that computation is an     unreasonable burden to place on the shoulders of AT developers.       JG: I think that AT developers who have concerns should express     them during last call. We should also have the DOM WG ensure that     our requirements make sense.       GR: Some AT developers have expressed that they don't have      resources to review the spec...       CMN: There are large browser developers and small AT developers,     but there are also small browser developers and some reasonably     large AT developers (significantly larger than browser teams). I'm     not sure that the pushing the burden on UA-based developers all the     time will be an appropriate solution, unless you want to have only     larger user agent developers.       GR: Not easy to do one-to-one mapping of UA developer's resources     to AT developer's resources. AT developers are not just focusing on     UA accessibility. They have to communicate with other software.      They may focus on specific user agents to cut down work.        MQ: At least for the PC, most people are using Internet Explorer.     If you look at that model, what difference would P1 and P3 make?          JG: If we raise this to P1, we would probably have to show much     greater dependency on this module. Up to a few months ago, we were     only depending on DOM 1. We are making one step here: get AT people     to start using the DOM. Perhaps in UAAG 1.1, after more experience,     and if we can convince AT developers to get more involved and to     show more dependency, we can raise the priority.       GR: AT manufacturers I've talked to have said until user agents     implement the DOM spec according to spec, there's no advantage     to implementing it (lack of interoperability).       IJ: That's not our problem, that's a problem of conformance to the     DOM spec.       DP: I see that it's our goal to have user agents expose as much     information as possible. Something that troubles me: wide disparity     about availability of information across platforms. I'd be for     raising the priority if we could defend the improved     interoperability.       RS: I think that having a specialized interface is a good idea,      but not a P1 requirement.       JG: I encourage GR to encourage AT developers to comment on this     checkpoint during last call.       2. All W3C working group meeting:      a) Who can attend: EH, DP, GR, MQ, TL or rep, JA, IJ, JG             probably: RS             probably not: CMN             don't know: KB, HB, AG         JG: So, about 8 people (not including W3C staff)        b) Preferred days (February 26-27 or March 1-2)         EH: I prefer later in the week.         MQ: I prefer later in the week. If I'm going to be there,             it's better for me to spend more time rather than less             (since a cross-country trip).         Conclusion: Slight preference for later in the week.       c) Groups we would like to meet with:        Some proposals:          - For UAAG 2.0 work: Mobile, Voice           - For ongoing coordination: WCAG, PF          - For repair issues: ER          - For AT requirements: DOM WG            RS: Seems like more of a PF function than UA to me.            IJ: It would be important to show up with proposals.          CMN: There's probably some good value in meeting with ATAG             as well. We plan to have a day working with the ER WG.             We resolved to move the "AERT" document to the ATAG WG.             http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WD-AERT/         MQ: Are Voice and Mobile groups working together?         CMN: Yes.         CMN: We should read all relevant specs before talking to            WGs (and expect them to read our specs).         JG: Our concerns should be UI and markup to promote       accessibility.          GR: We could follow the PF model and have specific individuals       track specs. Send reps to the different groups.          IJ: This seems to me to be a PF role: reading and tracking       specs and coordinating with WAI groups.         CMN: As a PF Member, I am currently working on SMIL. What SMIL       wants is a 3-week turn-around re: alternative content, keyboard       access, etc. Should I coordinate this with the UA WG, or would       that be a waste of time? I think that it would be useful if       people in UA take enough responsibility to read the specs, just       to coordinate with PF.         IJ: I agree.         GR: Me too, we need to be conversant in other technologies.         CMN: ATAG and ER have asked to meet together with a laundry list       of groups.         GR: We should try to build relationships with other groups       doing guidelines.         Proposed:          - A half-day meeting for UAAG WG alone.          - A meeting with UAAG, ATAG, WCAG WGs              - unified glossary              - conformance granularity, issues.          - A meeting with PF (and if possible, Voice and Mobile)          - A meeting with ERWG (to discuss repair functionalities              and implementation strategies) also possibly with ATAG.         Action JG: Propose these meetings to coordinators of all                  WG meeting.    3. Last call update       IJ: Shooting for Friday (tomorrow). Didn't happen     today since I was sick yesterday.           IJ: Also, it seems like issues that arose (equivalency, GR's         objections) will not require substantial changes          before going to last call (though objections will still be         treated as such).    4. What we will work on after last call starts:      - Implementation report. This is important and will       have an impact on whether we go to CR.      Do product evaluations as part of this.    - Techniques document review    - Update Impact matrix      Action IJ: Include request for implementation information    in last call announcement.      Action CMN: Check Amaya documentation accessibility.      Action MQ: Evalute user agents for conformance to three checkpoints    related to speech.      Action JA: Look for implementation of G7 checkpoints.      Action JG: Look for implementation of G5 checkpoints.      Action DP: Look for implementation of G1 checkpoints.      Action GR: Look for implementation of Documentation Guideline    checkpoints.      Format to follow:      - Checkpoint number in dated version of spec. Base analysis        on last call version.      - Please indicate operating system, names and version of         user agent(s) you are evaluating.      - If available, please provide a URL to evidence of your claim.    8. Equivalency issue     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0106.html      EH: I expect to propose editorial changes to the document. I don't    want to open any new issues by sending my comments.      IJ: If it is editorial, then it can wait until the next draft.    If it's really really editorial, then I can try to insert it.

It would be a misuse of MAP to use it for anything but navigation.  Thus, in a sense, a user agent may suppose that all MAPs are  for navigation (even if they may differ in structure).    > Are there additional hints that a browser should  > use (such as the topmost or bottommost or ....) to narrow down the  > decision.

Therefore, for  HTML one could add an element specifically to create navigation bars  (e.g.,  the BANNER element in HTML 3 as pointed out by Bert Bos). Or,   one could write a schema that includes vocabulary for navigation  bars. This would provide definitive information to any  user agent that recognized the schema.     > As to the specific changes, they both seem reasonable.

      Hello,    Wendy suggested that I send this to the list. It was my  response to the following question on the wai list:    Q: What is the effect on usability if any if a whole site or a whole   section of a site is database driven?    A:   This is a good question that the Web Content Guidelines  Working Group intends to address in the next version of  the Guidelines. My comments below do not represent consensus  in the Working Group, but are based on my understanding  of the problem.    On the one hand, whether content is written by hand,  created by an authoring tool, or generated by scripts  from a database does not change the requirements for  making it accessible. The content has to meet the  requirements of WCAG 1.0 for device-independence,  equivalent alternatives, navigation, orientation, etc.    However, the answer is complicated for the case of  content that is tailored to the particular capabilities  of a user (or the user's software) based on some negotiation  that takes place between the client and server. For example,  if a user has configured the user agent to accept certain  formats of content only (e.g., text), then the user has  explicitly requested that the server not deliver alternatives.  In that case, it would appear that the content does not  meet the requirements for including equivalents. And yet the  user has explicitly requested one format only. The WCAG 1.0  conformance requirements do not address this issue adequately.    I would suggest that one way to resolve this issue is to  consider the content "as a whole" that may be delivered by  the server. Users must be able to get some form of content  from the server that meets their needs, though they may  choose to put a filter on that content. The accessibility  of the site should be considered as a whole: can the user  access the site as a whole, even if some parts of it may be  inaccessible?     - Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      19 April 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0041    Reference document 11 April 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010411/    Minutes of previous meeting 5 April:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0009    Next meeting: 26 April teleconference:   Regrets: IJ (for 26 April and 3 May).    Present:    Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (scribe), Harvey Bingham,    David Poehlman, Tim Lacy, Mickey Quenzer, Eric Hansen,   Jim Allan    Regrets: Gregory Rosmaita    Absent: Denis Anson, Rich Schwerdtfeger,           Charles McCathieNevile    ----------  Discussion  ----------    1) What we should be doing now: implementations    JG: We need to be thinking about implementations now.  We should  be preparing to be using Candidate Recommendation period to test  the checkpoints, and to show that they improve accessibility. We  should be a little less concerned with improving the  document. The goal is getting conformance, implementation, and  outreach.    2) Proposed clarification to checkpoint 12.5:     (This and following points come from:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0034       Resolved: Adopt proposal.    3) Changing "for all" to narrower scope for checkpoints     2.1, 2.2, 8.1, and 8.2     Proposed in:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0044       Resolved:        - The user agent is not required to conform for *all*         formats.        - The claim should include information about which         formats are implemented for the purposes of         conformance.        - The claim should include information about          which APIs are implemented for the purposes of         conformance.       Action IJ: Edit the text of checkpoints 2.1, 2.2, 8.1,     and 8.2 so that UAs are not required to conform for     all formats that are implemented.    4) What should be done with lost packets?       Resolved:       - We do not require the user agent to buffer lost       packets when the user has paused a presentation.       - Clarify in the document that for some live        presentations, there may be information loss when        pause happens for 2.4, 3.5, and 4.4        - Technique: In this case, I think we should suggest in the     techniques document that the user agent should alert the user     (notably in the configuration to pause automatically) that     pausing may lead to information loss. We can also recommend     some buffering.    5) Will checkpoint 2.4 be useful in heavily     interactive presentations?       Resolved:       - We agree, there is some content where 2.4 pausing     may not result in optimal usability. But the user     can always turn off the configuration if they want to.       - Add a technique to allow the user element-level       control (e.g., to not pause for a particular        element).    6) What is the scope of 2.4? What must be paused?      JG: From a user's perspective, I would expect    the user agent to pause both streams. Most tools    only offer one pause button.      IJ: I think that in SMIL you always know that    the streams are going on in parallel (through <par>).       Resolved:       - We don't specify what should happen in this case.       Checkpoint 2.6 covers the case of synchronized       content. We don't say anything about what the        user agent should do when there are unsynchronized        streams. We are presuming that both streams       will be available at another time.       - Add a cross reference from 2.4 to 2.6 and       state that when the presentation is paused, we       expect that synchronized content would be paused       as well.    7) Checkpoint 3.3 (blinking/animation) and streams      - Clarify that animation effect and text stream (text      arrives over time) are independent. Give the      movie subtitles example as text that arrives      over time but is not animated.      - This is related to refresh (e.g,. a stock      ticker). Checkpoint 3.5 applies.        Action IJ: Make mention of animations, text streams,    and refresh in the document.    /* Jim leaves */    8) Checkpoint 4.6: Captions positioning.      Resolved:       - Allow technique of captions in another viewport for 4.6.       - Sample rewrite of checkpoint:         "For graphical viewports, allow the user to position text       transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions in the       same or another viewport."    9) Checkpoint 4.6: Captions positioning and layout issues.      JG: What happens when I want to increase the font size    and that causes layout problems?      JG: I think that we will need to test this checkpoint in CR.      JQ: Quicktime Player Pro lets you query the tracks of a movie,    and for some of the tracks, you can change some of the    properties. I can move captions around on the screen. But I    can't change the font size of the captions from the same    user interface.      Resolved:      - Add Note to 4.6 that this involves user override of      author-specified layout.      - Add Note to 4.6 that the user agent isn't required      to reflow the presentation (i.e., lay it out differently)      - If the format doesn't allow the user agent to reposition      the content, then the control applicability provision is      relevant.    10) Definition of "override".      Resolved:       - Define "user override" in the document.     - "User override" can mean:         a) Turn off or on.         b) Replace one value with another.    11) Issue 8: Checkpoint 10.9: Scope of position indicator?      Resolved:     - Don't state the granularity of the proportion indicator.   - Include the technique that is mentioned in:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0044      -----------  New actions  -----------    JG: Create third last call issues list.    -----------------  Completed actions  -----------------    HB: Talk to EO about publishing     "How do people with disabilities use the Web".

Rich, you  could present this topic and indicate current requirements. You  might also send to the UA mailing list a pointer to any materials  that are already available.

I think it minimally satisfies the requirement of making content  available. We include no specifics about how content must be rendered  (e.g., that alt content for an image be made available inline, in the  same geometric area as an image, a click away from the image, in  a tool tip, etc.). I wouldn't expect a user to have to read through  the encoding of a raster graphic. However, I think that providing  text in a view, even if it's surrounded by markup tags, allows users  access to that information and thus minimally satisfies the  requirement of making (text) content available. I agree that  not all attribute values are useful, but since we don't specify  that only those for humans need to be available to the user (since  it may not be specified clearly in the markup language which are  for humans and which are machines), I think it's "safest" to ensure  that they are all available.    I strongly agree that a source view is not an ideal solution,  however, I think it meets the requirements of a minimal solution  to the issue of availability of text content.    1) When rendered through the user interface, the information has to  be rendered for human consumption (and thus the GIF code doesn't  count, but text as part of a source view would).    2) When made available through an API, we don't care what the  data looks like.    We may need to clarify this.     - Ian     > In addition, there are only some attributes which are actually content for  > the user (title and alt are the main ones but I suspect there are a couple of  > others somewhere). longdesc, most of the attributes for object, name, id, and  > others are relevant to the User Agent but not directly to the user (except as  > a repair strategy for dealing with user agents that don't implement the  > relevant specifications) and exposing this information is not required, nor  > in many cases very helpful.  >   > In general having the ability to render the source is only relevant to "power  > users" who are able to interpret (and therefore write) the markup language,  > which is a small subset of those who read content.

Some  approaches for providing access to the long description would be:    1) Allow me to open a context menu and select a menu entry for     access to the long description. Note that some content may     have more than one associated equivalent, so such a dynamic     menu might have several entries.    2) Allow me to open a "get info" (inspect) view of some piece of     content that included details about the object, including links     to it's alternatives.    3) Insert a link after (or before, which might be configurable)     the image. This is the "D-link" approach to providing access     to long descriptions. This is what I mean by a link in context.    For some types of content, having the alternative inline might be  very burdensome (notably, for long text equivalents). Therefore  a link to that content is a better solution than simultaneous rendering  inline. For short equivalents (like alt), having the content  subsituted or rendered next to the primary content is probably  a better solution.     - Ian    > Ian wrote:  > We could say "allow configuration for one of the following:"  > 1) Render alt instead  > 2) Render alt alongside  > 3) Render link  > 4) Provide accses through the UI.  >   >  -Ian  >   >  > Ian,  > > I am OK with this, how about anybody else?  > >  > > Jon  > >  > > >  <NEW_UI>  > > >  2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives,  > > >    provide easy access to the alternative equivalents  > > >    through at least one of the following mechanisms:  > > >     - Allowing configuration to render alternative  > > >       instead of primary content.  > > >     - Allowing configuration to render alternative in addition to  > > >       primary content.  > > >     - Providing a direct link to the alternative in content,  > > >       just before or after the primary content.  > > >     - Allowing the user to select the primary content and then  > > >       inspect its alternatives.  > > >  <NEW_UI>  > > >  > > >Notes:  > > >  > > >1) I put back the word "easy" since that helps understand the  > > >    rationale.  > > >  > > >2) I hesitate to put four techniques in a checkpoint, but if  > > >implementing any one of them would mean that the UA met the  > > >requirement, then I'm ok with that level of specificity.  > > >  > > >  - Ian  > > >  > > >--  > > >Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  > > >Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  > > >Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783  > >  > > Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP  > > Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology  > > Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services  > > MC-574  > > College of Applied Life Studies  > > University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign  > > 1207 S.

Or does it simply  implement or not implement the behaviors specified by the author?    In the same vein, the user agent ultimately determines what the  user views, but the user agent doesn't just make up content.  I don't think it makes up behaviors either.    In this sense, active elements come from content.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I have been meaning to send a couple of notes from the  three meetings I attended in Bristol (U.K.):  the device independent workshop [1] and the WCAG [2] and   ATAG [3] Working Group face-to-face meetings. There are eight  points below, some of which touch directly on our work. These  points do not affect us right now and there are no proposals.    1) Techniques for Evaluating Authoring Tools for conformance.     The ATAG Working Group is doing some very cool work designing     techniques for evaluating authoring tool accessibility (refer     to their 13 September 2000 draft [4], for example). We should     also consider such a deliverable. The ATAG WG has come up with     some good ideas and we can benefit from the work they've done     in addressing some evaluation issues. They also intend to     create an interactive tool for helping people with evaluations,     and a well-designed tool could be reused by the UA Working Group.    2) At the Device Independent Workshop, people expressed a desire     for the next draft of the UAAG to cover additional classes of     user agents (e.g., mobile devices). This should be taken into     account as we discuss the scope of the next deliverables we      will produce.    3) The WCAG WG has been spending a lot of time on the structure of      their documentation (refer also to their requirements document      for WCAG 2.0 [5]). There were discussions about granularity     of conformance claims (we've been there, and this seems to     be a WAI-wide issue).     4) Some device independent issues related to user interface:      - People want the same user interface across applications        on a given platform (e.g., mobile).      - Power users (say 10% of users) want customization. They        are a vocal and powerful minority.     5) A comment on WCAG techniques: what happens if you do ALL     of them? Does this lead to a usable site? We could review     the UAAG Techniques with this question in mind.    6) In general, at the device-independent workshop, there was       a lot of discussion about the reality (or limitations) of     author-once-repurpose-often ideal. Many people felt like     "single authoring" was not useful in practice since authors     end up with a kind of "least common denominator" of content     that takes advantage of none of the useful features specific     to a given device. Other interesting topics:    7) Is it really possible to separate presentation     from structure? Some people argued that in some     cases, you have to tailor the content so much to     meet the capabilities of a particular device, that     you actually provide different content (e.g., a      summary), not just a reformatted version of the same     content. In short: One size does not fit all.     Furthermore, automatic transformation of content for     mobile devices was described as a "guess and pray"     process.    8) People were thinking more and more about content     as "applications", not "pages". And thus, how do     you make the application accessible?     - Ian    P.S. For more information, read the meeting minutes  linked below, some of which may not yet be available.

      Hello all,    The minutes are available online ([1], [2]) and linked from the home  page. The Working  Group was able to make a pass through all of the issues, and to resolve  almost  all of them. I will update the issues list as soon as possible. I have  quoted the  minutes below in text. These are raw minutes and may be edited.    On behalf of the Working Group, I would like to thank George Kerscher  and RFB&D for hosting our meeting. Everything went very smoothly.

This checkpoint was meant to allow configuration of prompting;         this is a clarification.       Action IJ: Propose wording to the list.    Issue 209       Resolved:      1. If document is not rendered when there is no style sheet, this is         not an accessibility issue.      2. The user agent should make available in an accessible manner the         fact that only the default style sheet is active, which may cause         no rendering.       Action IJ: Add to techniques.    Issue 210       Resolved:      1. Define author-specified to mean that the UA recognizes in markup.       Action IJ: Add to document.    Issue 211       Resolved: Add to checkpoint 2.5 that equivalent alternatives need to     be recognized.       Action IJ: Propose change to the list.    Issue 212       RS: We talked about different versions of the Guidelines in the     future.       HB: We want new technologies to come on board with where we are.       RS: We don't have a crystal ball to predict all the devices that are     coming out.       JG: We may want to attend conferences where new devices are presented     and discuss participation in WAI by those developers.       JG: One reason we did not expand the scope of the guidelines was that     some AT developers were not thrilled with the requirement for     interoperability/communication.       EH: Definitions seem tidy in PR version of guidelines, so we don't     need to say much more about what devices or not are "covered". What     more do we need to do?       RS: Why don't these guidelines cover more? E.g., could have a palm     device with the DOM.       CMN: I gave a talk in Japan. Mobile guys didn't understand why they     were concerned? It's still valuable to point people to these     guidelines, even if they don't apply entirely to your device.       RS: There is a need for more detailed guidelines for other devices. I     think we should say that these guidelines were designed primarily to     address desktop and other "heavy-weight" user agents and that we'll     try to address pervasive user agents in future work.       MQ: We don't want to discourage readers. Some of the guidelines apply     anyway.       EH: I think that we ought to use the terms already defined and say     that not every checkpoint is applicable to every user agent. And  leave     it at that. This means that some specialized user agents may have  only     6 applicable checkpoints, but they're still a user agent and should     satisfy them.       Resolved:      1. The Guidelines address applicability already. This means that we         recognize that some checkpoints don't apply to all user agents,         but many may apply to new user agents coming to market and we  want         these developers to consider how these checkpoints apply in their         devices.      2. The WG intentionally chose to limit the intended audience of user         agents in this version to graphical desktop user agents (e.g.,         graphical browsers, media players). In part, this was decided         because assistive technology developers were concerned by the         requirements for communication with other user agents. The WG         chose to address general purpose graphical user agents instead of         specialized user agents because the latter generally address  their         target audience well and are not intended to be universally         accessible.      3. The WG is developing a new charter and plans to address how  future         versions of the Guidelines may apply more specifically to         assistive technologies, mobile devices.      4. Rapid evolution of these devices makes it difficult today to         provide them with more guidance than we already do.       Action HB:      1. Ensure that the EO considers this question for the FAQ: Which  user         agents are covered by these Guidelines? Mention that the WG will         consider other classes of user agents in future work and will  seek         participation by developers.    Issue 213       MQ: It's a problem that applications don't know about each others hot     keys.       CMN: We can't solve that, but we can say don't make it worse.       Resolved:      1. Change "language features" to "markup language features".         Clarification.      2. Add examples to end of paragraph before note what readers will         find in UI style guidelines.    Issue 214       RS: You can't get at image map information for server-side image maps     since it's on the server.       CMN: You could get at the information on the server by flooding the     server. If we don't say "client-side" then we are requiring flooding.       MQ: We don't support server-side image maps. I don't quite understand     the reason.       RS: Server-side image maps are based on a pointing device.       CMN: The other alternative is to expose the image map and ask users  to     name points. And you've met the requirement.       Resolved: Leave it as is.    Issue 215       Resolved: Say that the button should have a text equivalent (adopt  the     proposal).    Issue 216       CMN: It's just an example.       Resolved: Add "For example" at the beginning of the sentence.    Issue 217       CMN: Yes, this is an alternative equivalent.       MQ: I think we're covered.       HR: A location equivalent would mean something like "these controls     are close together and that means that they're related". The sounds     are not equivalent alternatives if they don't provide that     information. Three-d sound does exist...       IJ: This grouping should be addressed by authors with markup (e.g.,     FIELDSET, OPTGROUP). We are covered by structured navigation.       CMN: My interpretation of the question was that it was about "where  am     I right now?"       RS: ATs provide "where am I" functionality.       Resolved: No change.      1. The author should not rely on graphical rendering to convey         semantics. When markup is provided, the UA should follow the  spec.      2. "Where am I" functionalities are offered by ATs.    Issue 218       Resolved:      1. Move and edit the sentence to 3.1 Note.    Issue 219       Resolved:      1. Adopt proposed editorial change.    Issue 220       EH: I think that the expression "respect sync cues" is nice, more     general. Some times tighter or looser synchronization.       KB: There may be times when people want to view them at different     rates, and this doesn't exclude that.       HR: Not all media can be slowed down to the same rate.       Resolved:      1. No change. Add a cross reference to 2.6      2. In 2.6, change to author-specified.    Issue 221       RS: Recall that if the OS feature is used, it must be accessible.       CMN: The time when you need controls is not the gross volume, it's  the     mixing volume. You'll need the UA to provide easy access to that     (which typically will be by punting to the OS).       Resolved:      1. This is covered by definition of native support.       Action IJ: Add note to Techniques.    Issue 222       Resolved:      1. This is covered by definition of native support.       Action IJ: Add note to Techniques.    Issue 223       IJ: "Changes" is generic. Not clear what is required.       RS: I don't think we intended to allow the user to configure keyboard     focus changes.       GR: There's the issue of how ATs pick up focus on new windows.       Resolved:      1. Allow the user to configure how the focus moves when there are         multiple viewports.       Action IJ: Tailor this wording and propose to list.    Issue 224       HB: Include notification that another viewport has opened.       JG: The two main things have been focus changes and programmatic     notification (covered elsewhere). Also, that user configurations are     inherited by new viewport instances.       JA: I think that the minimum is what 5.7 says (notification).       CMN: I think that the minimum requirement relates to "configuration":     The minimum requirement is to configure those things specified by the     document. And perhaps that turning off is part of the minimum     requirement. Point people to the definition of configure.       EH: We can add examples to the checkpoint. If you're relying on the     definition of "configure" and it has circularity with the  checkpoints,     that needs to be corrected.       EH: I don't think that our clarification means we need to state a     minimal requirement, but clarification is necessary.       The WG feels that this checkpoint includes:       * Notification (covered by 5.7)       * Prompting for opening or not, plus configuration of prompting       * Focus changes (covered by 4.15)       * Inheritance of configuration.       MN: These are listed in the techniques document.       RS: We shouldn't have dialogs prior to opening new viewports.       IJ: Recall that we used to allow turn on/off, but the SYMM WG said     this didn't work for SMIL presentations. Thus, configurability.       GR: I think that notification is key. Duplicate views should respect     focus position, otherwise might be disorienting.       IJ: I don't believe that we have a requirement for notification     through the UI when the focus changes viewports.       IJ:      1. I don't think having several viewports is an accessibility issue.      2. I don't think changes in number of viewports is an accessibility         issue if (1) there is notification programatically and through  the         UI and (2) the user can navigate to the new viewport and three  (3)         the user can configure how and when the focus changes.       RS: User agents today don't have a mechanism for programmatic     notification of change other than a focus change. DOM 3 has a notion     of views and we should address this in DOM 3.       Action RS: Take this to PF as a DOM 3 requirement.       IJ Proposed: The requirement is that the user be informed  (accessibly)     when a viewport is created or destroyed (that has not been created or     destroyed on request from the user). The same requirement should  apply     for the focus.       RS: Both of these requirements are covered inherently in the user     interface design. People with ATs get the information     programmatically, which we cover elsewhere (5.7).       MN: IE 4 notifies you programmatically when a new viewport has been     created.       KB: There are situations where the user may actually request  something     but they don't realize it. The user should be able to query how many     viewports are open.       Action GR: Send to list screen shot of JFW Window list.       EH: We may need a definition of window...       HB: There's a class of things we don't expect to cover (e.g., MS blue     screens).       RS: I think we are covered except those things that we have no  control     over. Do we want to limit to application-generated events and not all     system-generated events?       KB: If a Web page says "Following this link will open a new window",     is that considered an explicit user request?       CMN: I would have thought that was an explicit request, but that's     hard to find for the user agent. There can be something in markup     saying a new window will open. The UA should provide this type of     information.       Proposed: Delete 4.16.       Is inheritance of configuration in new windows a requirement?       Proposed: Add "inherit configurations in new viewports" to definition     of "configure".       JG: In G8, we have some checkpoints about links. We might want to     require that the user agent inform the user that following a link may     open a new window (recognized in markup).       RS: When you attach javascript, it may open a new window.       IJ: Note that UI notification of changes to prompts/windows not     covered in the guidelines. However, like changes to viewports, there     is notification programmatically and the assumption that users of the     primary interface will know.       RS: I think that it's implied that new viewports inherit features.       /* The WG will chew this over */    Issue 225       Resolved: This is covered by checkpoint 9.3    Issue 226       Resolved: This is editorial.       Action IJ: Clarify definitions of content, user interface (possibly     chrome), etc. Refer also to issue 207.    Issue 227       Resolved: Don't add "where available" since we have applicability  that     applies globally.    Issue 228       Resolved: No change. There's already a cross-reference to checkpoint     5.5, which talks about standard API.    Issue 229       CMN: There are a "bizillion" examples of accessibility settings in     earlier checkpoints.       Resolved: Editorial       Action IJ: Add a couple of examples (sticky keys, mouse keys, show     sounds).       /* Lunch 12:30 ET */    Issue 230       Does default keyboard configuration mean look at style guide     recommended key sequences for accelerators and things, Qwerty vs     Dvorak vs ?, both, or more? It should be clearer.       CMN: The answer is surely dependent on the system. If your system     doesn't care what keyboard you have, one set of guidelines. If  there's     a keypad, another.       RS: Default keyboard is some combination of what is specified by the     OS user interface and what the application specifies as its default     keyboard interface.       Resolved: Delete "default" from "default keyboard configuration". The     details of which keyboards are supported, etc. depend on the system.    Issue 231       IJ: The proposal seems to suggest another checkpoint requiring the  use     of accessible specifications.       Resolved:      1. Reverse sentences of Guideline subhead.      2. Add a note to G6 rationale that the scope is more than W3C specs.      3. Add a note to 6.1 as well to this effect.      4. Do not add a checkpoint requiring support for accessible         specifications. You can still provide accessibility even if you         don't.      5. Editorial: change "supported" to "implemented" (with  rewording...)       Action IJ: Add to techniques document Java (and point to Java     accessibility). SAMI?    Issue 232       IJ: Two issues:      1. Education      2. Scope (discussed in issue 212).       JG: Point the reviewer back to discussion about the multitude of     navigation checkpoints and how they got reduced: different display     control functionalities have their own place; we included those that     crossed boundaries into the guidelines themselves.       IJ: Refer to UA Responsibilities document for rationale.       EH: We can't predict every type of AT. We have extensive treatment of     applicability. We also have the impact matrix.       EH: I don't want to change the scope of the document.       GR: I think one of the main points of the comment is that it should  be     highlighted to AT developers what's expected of a "mainstream" UA.     It's bidirectional.       Resolved:      1. Since this document is meant for a certain class of UAs, we are         not concerned about the redundancy. The "line is drawn" by these         Guidelines.       Action IJ:      1. Editorial change: add explanation of how UAs and ATs interact.  And         or point to UA Responsibilities.      2. Editorial change: say to ATs that this is what they can expect         conforming UAs to do; if the mainstream browsers don't, then they         may pick up the slack.      3. Maybe add another statement about audience to the conformance         section.       GR: One of the biggest advantages for AT developers is the use of     standard interfaces (the DOM). A single navigation mechanism may be     used with different independent UAs.       RS: One complaint about HPR was that it didn't support Windows     navigation mechanisms. We will fix this; the market demands it and I     don't know whether we need to require ATs to support them. Just     because an AT implements these guidelines doesn't mean it's a     general-purpose user agent.    Issue 233       Proposed: Checkpoint 7.6: Change "structure" to "document object".       RS: If the UA provides programmatic access to the DOM, does this     suffice?       CMN: No. You may require access through the UI. The minimum  definition     of structural navigation in ATAG is "element by element". In many     cases, this will be painful, but it's clearly identifiable.       EH: Will switching to the term "document object" extend the scope?  (Or     narrow it?)       CMN: I don't think that the new term extends the scope. However, I     don't think that "document object" by itself provides the necessary     piece for a developer. (Ian notes that he has an action item to     include a definition.) What needs to be addressed is what nav     mechanisms are (minimally) required (e.g., up the tree, next sibling,     back, etc.). There are markup languages that don't have an inherent     tree language (e.g., Postscript). What navigation is required for  such     markup languages? You do cover the structure of a language like     Postscript by referring to "document object".       IJ: Note that we've already had a long discussion about the myriad     useful navigation techniques and resolved to have a single (open)     checkpoint since we could not come up with a minimal set.       JG: I'm concerned about saying what the minimal set of strucured     navigation techniques should be used. It depends on the content, how     its rendered, etc.       CMN: I would be very concerned about not specifying a minimum     conformance requirement for navigation mechanisms.       RS: You want to be able to navigate to all rendered content. You use     the DOM to traverse it in a logical sequence.       HR: I think that structural navigation has a purpose: get the     structure of the document without the details of the content. As long     as it meets this goal, sufficient.       EH: "Allow the user to navigate according to structure (e.g., forward     and backward through rendered elements)."       CMN: We're not talking about the W3C DOM per se; we're talking about  a     generic document model. I think HR is saying that this is a way of     getting around the document (in addition to the linear reading).       IJ: Speed/efficiency is the other advantage. Note that outline view     also gives you a vision of the structure.       GR: I like having open-endedness and configurability (chunk-by-chunk,     then lower detail).       IJ: The minimal requirement is access to every piece of the document     object.       RS: If you're navigating through the UI, it's only access to what's     rendered in the UI.       EH: You have different classes of object within the object model. One     piece of efficiency is the ability of navigate objects of the same     class (e.g., headings).       Proposed:      1. Change "structure" to document object.      2. Minimal requirement of navigation is access to every element of         the document object.       EH: Note that point two misses the point of efficiency, which was the     key to the checkpoint. This is the same as viewing the content     serially.       JG: Add a note that this checkpoint is designed to improve efficient     access.       IJ: What about a minimal requirement of "more than sequential access"     to the document object.       MN: "Document object" confuses me more than "structure". Also, there     are objects within the document, etc.       IJ: Propose adding point 3: Because this checkpoint is meant to make     access more efficient, user agents are expected to provide more than     minimal access. Point to techniques.       RS: Should we add the term "iterator"?       HR: I am in favor of both improved efficiency and local/global     inspection of the structure.       MN: I agree with HB - elements and attributes.       JA: I agree with points 1, 2, and 3 together.       Resolved (pending proposal from Ian on definition of content/document     object/user interface/element, etc.      1. Change "structure" to document object.      2. Minimal requirement of navigation is access to every element of         the document object.      3. Add a note that we expect more than minimal access (point to         techniques)      4. Make clear that this is not about the W3C DOM for all types of         content (it's about a "document object".       RS: Ensure that the user agent doesn't supply a different object  model     than the DOM for XML/HTML content.    Issue 234       Resolved: Editorial. Move to G9 (Checkpoint 9.4).    Issue 235       Resolved:      1. Add HTML examples to 8.1      2. In section 1.3 of document, explain that some checkpoints are         important special cases of others and have been included to         highlight particularly important requirements.    Issue 236       Resolved: Editorial. Add a cross-ref to G5.    Issue 237       CMN: I suggest we move the word "mobility" from the note.       MN: We usually talk about "built-in" accessibility features.       CMN: How about "default"?       Resolved: Editorial. Delete "mobility". Maybe add a required term to     glossary.    Issue 238       CMN: This is "applicability of available keys".       Resolved: Add a note that in some modes (e.g., text input mode), is     not required due to the nature of the mode.    Issue 239       Proposed: For example, on some operating systems, when developers     specify which command sequences will activate which functionalities,     standard user interface components display those bindings to the  user.     For example, if a functionality is available from a menu, the letter     of the activating key is underlined in the menu.       Resolved: Editorial. Adopt some form of above proposal.    Issue 240       Resolved: Editorial. Don't feel it's necessary to add.    Issue 241       IJ: Relates to issue 207. Does a structured view suffice for some     types of content? Previous discussions about 207 suggest that the WG     feels that a source view does not suffice for content that may be     rendered through the UI (it's too hard to navigate the entire     structure to get at the "title" attribute).       Resolved: This is resolved according to the outcome of issue 207.    Issue 242       Resolved: No, DOM access is not sufficient. All checkpoints meant to     be satisfied natively through the UI unless explicitly stated     otherwise. Refer also to issue 233.       (Note to self: ensure to say that all checkpoints imply through the  UI     unless it's stated explicitly that it's programmatic or both     programmatic/ui.)    Issue 243       CMN: IE ? has an option that prompts you whether you want to submit.       JG: This is done for reasons of security as well.       EH: (refer also to issue discussed previously).       RS: How hard will this be to implement?       CMN: Easy: UA knows when it's about to send a POST request.       MQ: I'm not sure that having to answer a "don't post yet" prompt  every     time that you select a new item is a good idea.       CMN: You are not forced every time - you can turn it off.       GR: I proposed a two part solution: submit mechanism was one part,     another was scripted stuff. The first part was for inadvertent form     submission. The second was to disable behavior like selecting a menu     item triggers the form.       IJ: MQ's concern is addressed by the ability to turn off scripts     (although it may be burdensome to have to do this repeatedly for a     given form).       RS: When do you know to turn off scripts (how does the user know that     there are scripts bound to a select item)?       Resolved: Leave P2 since it affects users who may be disoriented     (blindness, CD).       IJ: I propose addressing MQ's concern more in the techniques for 9.2     (e.g., for long lists, don't prompt 100 times).       RS: This is more of a usability than an accessibility issue.       MQ: In WebSpeak, if there is no explicit submit button, we create  one.       Action IJ: Add this to the techniques document...       GR: For the "50 states in a list" box example, this form is embedded     in a larger form.       RS: I have the same problem as users with disabilities.       GR: But you know the change has taken place visually. For me, it's     much more difficult and disorienting to get back to the previous     state. I think that this is P3 for usability, P2 for accessibility.       CMN: This is a "curb cut" type checkpoint. It's helpful for many     people (P3), but very important (P2) for some users.       GR: Refer to my (archived) problem statement that explains all of the     accessibility problems associated with this situation.       RS: What if the AT says "A new page has been loaded."       MQ: Users don't know that they need to turn off scripts to achieve     this goal.       GR: Also, by turning off scripts, they may lose other capabilities.       MQ: I think this needs to be a P1, not a P2. (Ready to register a     minority objection to it being P2).       HR: In the example we are using (menu items), do you have to use the     mouse?       JG: Yes.       JA, MN: Leave a P2.       GR: I think in Austin, we also talked about notification, and that     helped out (less than P1).       Proposed:      1. There is an authoring problem (that is addressed in WCAG).      2. This is both a usability and an accessibility issue.      3. In cases of lists that trigger scripts, if sequential access to a         list triggers a form submission, you might never get past list         item 1 unless you can control it. You can do this by turning off         scripts. However, you don't know in advance that you have to do         this. (or turn them back on).       Straw poll:      1. P1: GR, MQ      2. P2: CMN, HB, EH, JG, HR, MN, JA, IJ      3. P3: RS       IJ: I feel that without new information, I will hesitate to allow     proposed changes at this time without new information. The WG already     agreed to make this a P2 as of Last Call. It should be harder to make     changes at this point. I want to make it harder.       CMN: I propose that we put an action item on anyone who feels this  has     to be changed to register a minority objection (that will be  presented     to the Director).       HR: Outspoken (screen-reader) handles this case gracefully.       Resolution: Leave a Priority 2.       Action: Anyone who objects can register their objection on the list.    Issue 244       CMN:      1. This is comment in speech presentations. I don't know of  reference         implementations for video. You can do it in hardware.      2. I spoke to the Real Media people and they said that it would be         difficult due to timing issues and slowing audio.       RS: Unless there's a reference implementation, I don't think this     should be a P1 requirement.       CMN: I don't find that argument convincing. People might not do it     because it's hard, but that's not sufficient.       MQ: "LP Player" lets you speed up and slow down audio.       IJ: Priority levels are based on user need, not implementability.       RS: I don't want to make the guidelines so strict that it's not     possible to reach P1. I think we lose our credibility if it's too  hard     to do.       IJ: Applicability kicks in here: if not possible by spec, you aren't     required to do it.       GR: About raising the bar - the reason we are here is not to raise  the     bar but to put the bar where it belongs (since it may have been     knocked down in some implementations). I understand the concerns of     developers, but it's not just about developers - it's for users, too.     We need to work with them.       CMN: There's an unresolvable tension between losing "credibility"  with     developers and losing credibility with the users who are meant to     benefit. The priority scheme is based entirely on user need (and this     is a fairly important feature). All three guidelines groups have  tried     other systems, but in each case, it's been a complete minefield.       IJ: Would users not have access if they couldn't slow down the     presentation?       MQ: Partially deaf people can have access to audio by slowing it  down.       MQ: Have you looked at "Sound Forge"? It plays back MP3 (and authors     it) and allows you to change the presentation playback rate (you     change time base and pitch).       JG: Why is slowing video important?       IJ: Physical disabilities may require slowing down.       CMN: One possibility is that being able to step through frames is a     sufficient slowing of video. You can't step through slowing of audio,     however.       IJ: If we split into separate requirements (video, audio, animations)     does this get easier? Does it get easier for us to resolve if we talk     about synchronized multimedia separately?       CMN: It is difficult to change time base, change pitch, keep it     synched, etc.       EH: If we deconstruct the checkpoint, we should look at the usage of     the words (audio, video, and animation) as well. Perhaps we should     distinguish "audio presentation" from "multimedia presentation". An     "audio presentation" is audio only (e.g., a radio broadcast). A     multimedia presentation is either movies or animations.       CMN: Another question is "What is the need for slowing down     presentations?"       * For audio presentations: slowing down the presentation will         benefit users with cognitive disabilities.       * For animation, may be be seizure information.       * Who benefits from slower video?       CMN: For slowing pure audio presentation, that's fairly easy. For     video only, also fairly easy. The problem is combining them as     multimedia.       RS: Yes, I have a problem with the combination.       CMN: Synchronization is an accessibility issue because the audio     information is required to make the presentation accessible.       GR: We should review EH's last call comments...Recall also that DA     required slowing down by configuration (rather than dynamic     button-based slowing) since otherwise some users with physical     disabilities would not be able to slow down.       MQ: LP Player basically does the sync of audio and text.       CMN: Another nearly reference implementation is video-editing     software.       RS: This is expensive...       CMN: Yes, but it can be done. And it's not tremendously expensive.     What this software doesn't do as a rule is adjust audio when the rate     changes.       Review:       * For auditory presentations, slowing down a P1.       * For video presentations, slowing definitely helps users with CD,         probably helps users with low vision. So P1.       * For animations, ability to slow might help users with seizure         disorders. So P1.       MN: No one has said that this can't be done. It can be difficult.       IJ: Maybe this is the case: synchronization is required at "normal"     rate (2.6). But the "slowing" requirement may not be the same  priority     if those who benefit from slowing are not an intersection of those  who     benefit from the individual pieces.       HR: I don't think that slowing should these media is a P1 since you     can start, stop, pause, rewind.       JG: It is a P1 for audio since you can't step through audio. You  could     step through video and get some information out.       CMN: Use case - cricket! You get a noise from the "stumps" and video     from the "thingy". You need to synchronize the two at which point the     two came together. You can get this information through step through     (since you don't care about the quality of the sound). But I imagine     that the quality of sound is important in some cases.       GR: When I hear things like animation, I think of things like     macromedia, flash, shockwave (and not just SMIL). When you have to     respond to an on-screen video event and a sound, you need to be able     to slow down.       Resolved:       * Slowing down audio a P1 (you can't step through it). You may not         be able to slow down past a certain point (but some access better         than no access).       * Need to review the priority of slowing down video presentation.       * Need to distinguish "sounds" from "audio presentations" (refer to         EH's proposal in last call).       RS: I don't think that the benefits of slowing down the presentation     warrant it being a P1. And the cost is very high.       /* Discussion of slowing according to pre-determined increments,  e.g.,     half-speed */       /* Madeleine Rothberg joins */       MR: I think that a lot of the slowing down issues (especially for     animations), were intended for users with CD and that's not my     expertise. The techniques for this say that this is for people with     CD, new to a language, and newly acquired sensory disabilities. For     auditory presentations, what if you understand it by listening  several     times? I'm not sure about the P1 level for audio presentations.       JG: I don't think that we've heard P1 for sight disabilities.       CMN: I have to speak (Australian) more slowly to be understood in the     states than I would at home.       MQ: People that are partially deaf have to slow down material in  order     to understand.       CMN: Maybe we should assign actions to review this carefully?       HB: In the Daisy guidelines, they have a speech range for the player.     It's something like half-speed to 2.5 times.       JA: Yes, I think it's town to 25% and up to double speed.       JG: Note that speeding up audio for users who are blind is not an     accessibility issue but a usability issue.       JA: Depending on the type of vision, some students cannot use a     presentation at full speed. They simply can't see it. If they can  slow     down video, they can get at the information.       JG: Is there a range that we can specify?       JA: No, the kids have very different requirements.       MR: It also depends on the initial rate of the animation. Many     variables.       JA: I think that much beyond a 25% reduction, you start losing your     audio anyway.       MR: The players I've seen that play video more slowly, keep sync of     captions, but turn off audio. Windows Media player can be scripted to     slow down caption presentation rate (it's not in the player itself).       /* George Kerscher pulled in from the hall */       GK: There are many implementations that let you slow down audio     presentations (VisuAid, Victor, PlexTalk (by Plextor), LP Player by     PW, and Labyrinten). These are standard tools on the market to do     this.       Action MR: Talk to Geoff Freed about implementations that slow down     multimedia presentations.       GK: Some people with learning disabilities need to slow down the  audio     in order to process the information. Synchronized with text.       MN: I'm concerned that we're going to establish priorities based on     reference implementations. This is not what we're charged to do.       GK: In the SMIL WG, there's a requirement to have two implementations     of any feature.       JG: Yes, but our references are not based on existing implementations     (though implementations help us show how it's down); it's based on     user needs.       Action JG: Write email to the list asking for information about which     user groups require the ability to slow down presentations othewise     access it impossible. (Get information from people with     experience/research in this area).       GK: I believe that in the SMIL specification, the notion of the wall     clock is there. For people who benefit from a complex multimedia     presentation, it's clear that slowing down is obviously needed by  some     users.       IJ: Please note that I believe we're only talking about explicitly     synchronized multimedia presentations.       RS: Yes, that's fine. But you shouldn't be required to slow down to     the same rate two pieces of content that have not been explicitly     synchronized. Otherwise there would be no use for SMIL.       EH: Even though impact determines priority, it's my opinion that we     should not include impossible or extremely costly checkpoints. I  don't     have a lot of expertise on how important these things are to users     with disabilities. I'm withholding judgment now since I suppose that     this checkpoint has had a lot of review at this level.       CMN: I don't think there are many cases when you have several pieces     of content together but aren't synchronized explicitly.       Proposed: Clarify for this checkpoint that we do not require slowing     down of pieces of content that haven't been synchronized in the  format     but are playing together.       RS: I don't think Quicktime counts as a syncronization format. Same     for AVI.       EH: This is a very late stage in the process. I assume that this has     had a lot of review. I'm inclined to go with P1, unless this is a     total show-stopper.       RS: Once again, I don't want to make the barrier too high initially.     We need to weigh the benefits against the costs.       EH: I hammered on WCAG for this - how do you define the reference     groups? You can always find individuals who need a particular  feature.     I pushed WAI to identify target groups. I suggested (even though I     knew it wouldn't be popular) that we say something like "a  substantial     majority would find it impossible, beneficial, etc.".       GR: Users with a disability who get to the table early and who are     vocal tend to get their issues addressed. But users who haven't had     access to information, and who haven't been able to speak up, are     being overloooked.       JG: We will postpone this issue and not start with it first thing     tomorrow. I suggest that we address it on Thursday.       /* 5:30 pm adjourned */  ------------                    Minutes from 11 April 2000 UA face-to-face at RFBD    Participants         * Jon Gunderson (Chair)       * Ian Jacobs (Scribe)       * Harvey Bingham       * Mickey Quenzer       * Gregory Rosmaita       * Charles McCathieNevile       * Hans Riesebos       * Rich Schwerdtfeger       By phone:       * Jim Allan       * Kitch Barnicle       * Mark Novak       * Madeleine Rothberg (before the break)       * Eric Hansen (late)       Agenda    Issue 245       Proposed: s/functionality/information and s/button/graphical icon.       Resolved: The checkpoint is only about messages, not all UI     components.       Action IJ: Propose a new note to the WG (with graphics and sounds).    Issue 249       (Refer also to Issue 271).       CMN: CSS2 positioning. Problem with zooming languages that have no     text flow (e.g., SVG).       IJ: I've also heard that arbitrary positioning isn't required.       MR: An issue about content being obscured. And if the user magnifies     the screen, they need to be able to move captions.       IJ: I don't think you can make an absolute statement that one piece  of     content must not obscure another piece of content.       CMN: I think that Sausage SMIL Composer lets you more captions.       Resolved: No change.       * There's a user need for this functionality; priority not based on         existing implementation.       * Arbitrary repositioning is not required - the goal is to ensure         that text is not obscured.       * Quicktime allows you to do this.    Issue 271       CMN: The question is what's the minimal requirement? I think that:      1. You should first implement the capabilities of the spec (e.g.,         SMIL layout, Quicktime, SAMI?).      2. The user has to at least be able to ensure that text equivalents         are not obscured by other content.       IJ Proposed:       * Add "When text equivalents may obscure or be obscured by other         content, ...."       IJ: Does the player need to allow repositioning when it knows (e.g.,     geometries) that the content does not overlap?       CMN: Yes, when zoomed.       MR: One scenario when it's useful to overlap: when you're viewing on  a     small screen - or when your screen geometry is different from what  the     author intended.       MQ: The AT might be able to find the information when it's in a     particular position.       CMN: I think that arbitrary positioning is what you need to be able  to     do.       IJ: Why in this case and not others (e.g., colors, fonts, etc.)       MQ: Putting alt content in another window may make it more available     to other technologies.       CMN: I think that the checkpoint should require the user agent to     allow arbitrary repositioning. For example, if captions overlap     subtitles, need to move them out of the way.       IJ: I don't think the text says that today. Given the definition of     "configure".       IJ: I hear two cases for minimal requirement:      1. Minimal requirement is to prevent content from being obscured.      2. Device limitations mean that I need to overlap information.       GR: You need both at the same time in both cases (you need the     synchronization)       KB: If I have narrow vision, need to move things into my range of     vision.       Resolved:       * Goal: Ensure that the user has access to content (whether it  means         choosing to obscure other content or preventing that).       * Minimal requirement:           1. Implement the capabilities for repositioning for the markup              language that the UA can recognize.           2. If the UA can recognize different pieces but no the markup              language doesn't have features for repositioning, use repair              techniques.           3. If the UA cannot recognize different pieces, then              applicability (e.g., GIF).       * Examples of user needs that mean that arbitrary repositioning         required: restricted field of view requires overlapping, don't         want to obscure content and don't always know where the key         information on the display is, both for screen mag and  refreshable         braille you can position in a given place and have ATs monitor         that.       Action IJ: Propose a Note stating the minimal requirement and     emphasizing the goal. Add examples to techniques document.    Issue 246       Resolved: Editorial - make suggested change in light of other     discussions on "author-specified" and the results of checkpoint 2.1    Issue 247       Resolved:       * Add "When the user agent can recognize..."       * Add technique that prose doesn't count.    Issue 248       GR: There are fonts that people cannot use for a variety of reasons.     At any size.       Resolved: No change.       Action:       * Add minimal requirement that for CSS fonts, use the generic  fonts.       Action CMN: Find out from I18N how to generalize the accessibility     provided by sans-serif fonts.       IJ: Any minimal font size?       GR: I would make my font as small as possible to get more content on     the page.    Issue 250       CMN: The use of micropayments is a technique in this case. The     requirement is about spending money, but micropayments are just an     example.       HR: Is paying the only bad thing that can happen when you can follow  a     link?       JG: The WG felt that this was important enough.       GR: I would have pulled out other ones (and not this one) but we were     able to separate this one because of the micropayments draft.       CMN: Al Gilman said that this is a CD issue. You have to make it  clear     to people that their money is disappearing.       HR: I have problems with the current wording. I think the general     requirement is to avoid that bad things happen when you follow a  link.       CMN: I spoke to developers about a checkpoint for making available     useful information (this was the original checkpoint). It was too     ambiguous. Checkpoint 8.4 says "make available everything you know."     But since paying money was more serious, it was special cased at a     higher priority level.       IJ: Just because we identified one important requirement and not     others, doesn't mean we should delete the first one. Also, the fact     that we require making available all information (8.4) means you can     avoid bad situations as well as pursue good ones.       Resolved: No change.       * Important special case of 8.4 as indicated.       * This is important for users with CD.       /* Break */    Issue 251       CMN: How does the author know what affects accessibility?       IJ: Read this document!       IJ: Does new support for the Thai language affect accessibility?       GR: Yes, if you're a Thai user with a disability.       RS: But that affects all users who speak Thai.       CMN: The things that affect accessibility are those things mentioned     in this document. There are specific checkpoints about language     support in the guidelines.       Resolved:      1. Adopt proposal.      2. Minimal requirement is to cover the features of this document.    Issue 252       Resolved:      1. No change. The WG has already considered two conformance schemes         that would allow for more granularity (based on user needs and         checklist-based).      2. The WAI CG might want to consider this issue at a higher level.       Action JG: Take this to the WAI CG.    Note:       Issues 253 to 276 were not part of the formal review but should be     considered by the WG.    Issue 253       RS: MSAA does not solve all problems. It doesn't provide access to     text in all applications. You need to do both. There are some ATs  that     don't support all of MSAA (for example).       HR: On the Mac, there isn't an accessibility API. Even for our PC, we     rely on the offscreen model, in part because we cannot use MSAA on  Win     95 because it's not internationalized.       RS: You are a UA with a custom control that MSAA doesn't provide     access to. The AT (like a screen reader) would need to read the text     that you drew to the screen.       IJ: Are you always required to use the devices?       RS: MSAA is limited today to standard controls. It doesn't handle  well     custom controls.       MN: MSAA is for getting input, not writing to the screen.       JG: There are two parts - the part where the developer creates     objections compatible with MSAA, and the other where the UA gets     events from it.       RS: For input, for custom controls, you want to be able to respond to     serial keys.       MN: I don't think it's important. MSAA is just one of several     technologies.       RS: You need to always support standard input since MSAA or others     have nothing to do with standard input. For standard output ("Can I     write to the screen or use MSAA?"), if you use standard controls you     don't have to do anything anyway. If you are going to write a custom     control, MSAA is not always reliable and there are older screen     readers that don't use MSAA. So there is a requirement to do both.       GR: There is also an I18N lag with MSAA.       IJ: It seems new to me that we are requiring redundant output.       RS: Suppose I'm writing a custom button that has it's own window     class. To be accessible to an AT that doesn't support MSAA for the     custom component, you have to use std API so that the AT can get the     information. Another example: Suppose that you're Mozilla, designed     for cross platform. For that reason, you don't support MSAA and need     to draw text to the screen (until you support the DOM...).       MN: I don't think you need to get into details about which a  developer     needs to use. I agree with the reviewer: the UA should be able to     conform by providing info through either one API or the other.       RS: If there's an engineered API (e.g., MSAA) you should use that API     and ensure that it works. And if this is more accessible, this should     take precedence over drawing to the screen.       MN: I see 5.5 as a special case of 2.1.       RS: For output, you should implement MSAA or the DOM first (if     applicable). If they don't apply, draw text to the screen.       IJ: Add a note to checkpoint 1.2 that says "When available, it is     preferable to use the APIs discussed in G5 instead of using standard     device APIs directly."       CMN: It's more preferable to use both directly. If you use MSAA or  the     DOM and then you also rasterize a picture, then you need to use std     APIs.       IJ: I have heard:      1. Do both      2. Do either      3. Use MSAA as a preference.       RS: In JAVA 2, you have to use the accessibility APIs.       Resolved: No change.       Action IJ: Add a cross reference to guideline 5. In techniques,     discuss advantages of doing both.    Issue 254       JG: Is "zoom" the right term.       CMN: In HTML and CSS, you can increase the font size and text reflows     nicely. And the reviewer's comment is true. In SVG, you get no reflow     when the font size it changed: text may overlap when the text is     resized, so zoom is the preferred technique in this case.       JG: "Zoom" in one context can mean to take one pixel and make it four     pixels.       IJ: I think that "zoom" must means go in and out.       HR: I don't think that "zoom" is an adequate term.       CMN: Some user agents rescale and reflow as their zoom.       HB: I think that magnify and reflow and one of the most important     accessibility techniques for someone with low vision.       MQ: We want to be able to make content more accessible, and word wrap     is important to this.       Resolved: No change.       Action IJ: In techniques document, discuss what CMN has been     discussing. Just changing font size may obscure information and     scaling would be better. Reflowing (e.g., word wrap) is a good thing     to do and should be discussed in techniques.    Issue 255       Various pieces required:      1. Use standard APIs for devices, as opposed to non-standard APIs.      2. Support devices considered standard for the platform.      3. Support the keyboard (on systems where standard).       CMN: If the keyboard is a standard input API for your system, you  have     to use it.       JG: I think we resolved that you don't have to support all standard     APIs.       CMN: I'm not sure I agree. Depends on the meaning of "standard".       Proposed:       * 1.2 For all supported input and output devices, use the standard         device APIs of the operating system. (i.e., supported by the UA).       * 1.4 On systems where a keyboard API is available, ensure that         every functionality available through the user interface is         available through it.       * The definition of standard device API includes info about  expected         support.       CMN: I think the UA should support all standard APIs for the  operating     system. It's not sufficient to expect support for a subset of them.       JG: The WG has already agreed that this is an undue burden - I don't     have to support the bar code reader API.       CMN: If the standard API allows you just to dump a rasterized image  to     the screen, does this suffice? This does not make the information     accessible to ATs.       IJ: I don't see how the misuse of an API is resolved by requiring the     use of more APIs.       GR: We need to (a) highlight in the text of the guideline that user     agents should use higher level routines.       RS: In Windows, you would use "textout" or "exttextout" to draw     text...       JG: CMN, do you want UAs to draw information more than one way to the     screen?       CMN: I want one standard API that does the redundant work for you  (and     so that you don't have to draw manually through the other API).       RS: If you use MFC or visual basic, you should ensure that those     libraries default to the standard system API for drawing text.       CMN: You could imagine a system where there is a keyboard API and a     generic text input API.       Proposed:      1. Use appropriate APIs. (Use the generic one, use the right device         API for a given content type, etc.).       GR: I think this should be in the prose.       CMN Proposes: Delete "device" from 1.1 and 1.2. The question remains  -     if you use a good programming language, it will automatically put  your     information through the standard device APIs. "Use the standard input     and output APIs for the operating system."       IJ: What's the scope of "input and output"? Does this include port 80     for HTTP? The "stdout" on Unix?       IJ Questions:       * How much redundancy required? If you have to support all input or         output APIs, do you have to use all of them for all input or         output?         CMN: Redundancy only required when information isn't propagated  by         the API to others.       * How many APIs required?         CMN: This has been answered by MN and HR. MSAA may not be the  best         way to get access.       JG: Where do you stop? Infrared access? Writing to disk?       CMN: On most systems, redirect is automatic.       RS: You could say "for those devices that allow the user to interact     with the system."       CMN: You can push info around through MSAA. But if you put it into     MSAA, it gets propagated.       HR: You don't have to give all functionality to the user through the     voice API. You do through the keyboard.       Resolved:       * 1.1: Delete "device"       * 1.2: Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating         system.         - Point out that APIs should be used appropriately - use the text         API for text, don't use the graphical API.         - Point out that people should not work around standard APIs.         - Point out that there may be preferences in APIs (e.g., use more         abstract over lower-level, but ensure that information reaches         lower-level APIs).       * 1.4: On systems that support a keyboard API, ensure that every         functionality available through the user interface is available         through the keyboard API.    Issue 256       JG: Conformance does not *necessarily* guarantee accessibility (and     non-conformance doesn't guarantee inaccessibility). Refer to last  call     issue.       CMN: In 5.5, we guarantee programmatic access. This means you can run     whatever device you want.       CMN: Max (Nakane) has a telephone that he uses to access the Web. But     the output mode is through the screen, and that's all. The phone     doesn't export anything as far as I know.       IJ: Consider for this case, a kiosk that doesn't allow you to plug     into it (Guideline 5 drops) or a handheld device that has limited RAM     (no room for other software, or it's not a multitasking system).       MQ: This means no mobile device can conform to these guidelines.       CMN: If you have just speech output, or just keyboard input, and     hardwired programming and no way in, you can claim that 5.5 doesn't     apply. This means that inaccessible device could comply.       IJ: I consider dropping this clause of the applicability provision a     significant change to the guidelines.       CMN: As do I.       HR: I don't think it's not conforming then - we want the devices to     meet as many checkpoints as they can.       GR: The way the current conformance statement is stated, those     considered inapplicable must be stated up front.     Consumers/Purchases/Regulators can establish whether it meets their     particular needs.       CMN: Conformance is not the end-all of the accessibility of the tool.       IJ: I still think that hardward and software limitations affect the     range of configurability (e.g., colors, fonts).       RS: We don't need to delete the provision since we are not really     addressing mobile devices. More work needs to be done.       JG: Do people understand that the current applicability provision     means that for any mobile device that doesn't allow communication  with     other devices means that Guideline 5 doesn't apply?       /* Everyone agrees */       JG: How many feel the document should become a Recomendation this  way?       HB: I would like to make it explicit that we are excluding devices.       JG: We do not have guidelines for a user agent that does  "everything".     We can always find some group that doesn't have access, so we require     communication of content and user interface (interoperability). We've     already discussed "stand-alone" conformance.       CMN: I don't think the guidelines should become a Rec with the  current     provision about hardware limitations.       Resolved:      1. Delete the provision about applicability about hardware.      2. Add a comment about how system limitations may affect ranges of         configurability.      3. We argue that this change is in line (i.e., a clarification) of         what the intended and documented audience of UAs is meant to be.    Issue 257       IJ: Two parts      1. We could improve the techniques document by classifying  techniques         (informative, sufficient, beneficial).      2. We should make clear in the guidelines the minimal requirement  for         each checkpoint.       CMN: I think that number 2. is very important. The Director has said     that the Recommendation (the guidelines) must be able to stand on its     own - you must be able to derive what's required for conformance.       Action JG: Identify the minimal requirement for each checkpoint.    Issue 258       Resolved: Adopt proposal       Action IJ: Add statement up front that everything through UI except     where stated that through API or both.    Issue 259       Resolved: No change. Using OS features is a good thing, but must be     accessible.    Issue 260       Resolved: Editorial.       Action IJ: Propose changed second sentence of 1.1 to the list.    Issue 261       Resolved: The intent is indeed support for every supported input     device. No change.       /* Eric joins */    Issue 262       CMN: As we've discussed at length today, there are a lot of operating     system conventions for accessibility (e.g., standard APIs). There's     nothing in the guidelines that says "don't provide a better     installation setup." The Guidelines do say "use the standards since     some device you didn't think of may not be able to use it.       EH: Need to clarify what the accessibility settings are. Are we the     judges about what the conventions are?       IJ: We refer to system guidelines for accessibility. I propose:      1. New wording: "Follow operating system conventions that affect         accessibility."      2. This means that you can be better and single-A, but only double-A         if you use standards.      3. The conventions are those of OS guidelines and what is described         in this document.    Issue 263       JG: For users with screen magnifiers, context-sensitive access     important.       GR: Two-dimensional tables rely on understanding relationships     expressed through layout.       CMN: I've argued in the past that the "standard" graphical rendering     of a table in two-dimensional layout is a sufficient technique for     making clear the relationship among table cells.       Resolved:      1. This is a P1 requirement since relationships need to be available         to users to understand the table.      2. Grid rendering graphically is sufficient to meet the requirement         for a graphical desktop user agent. This is a P1 because it helps         users with screen magnifiers or CD and large tables.      3. You must be able to get at all the cells in their relationship.         Scrolling in two dimensions is a sufficient technique. Structured         navigation is a sufficient technique. Lynx fails because the  table         cannot be understood.       Action CMN: Propose a technique that explains how serialization plus     navigation would suffice.    Issue 264       CMN: Users have access to the text according to 2.5 (being able to     select alternatives). Thus no changes required to provide what he's     asking for.       EH: The definition of alternative equivalent does make a distinction     between primary and alternative content. A strict reading of the term     "equivalent alternative" would mean that the image wouldn't count.       IJ: Have we heard that images are distracting to users with CD? If     not, why is this checkpoint here?       EH: Images may also bother users with low vision (who may be     distracted).       EH: Up to this point, people I've spoken to would distinguish between     CD and learning disabilities.       Action IJ: Ask reviewer for more data.    Issue 265       IJ: It is disorienting for users with CD, or who are blind or     accessing information serially. I can see that it doesn't prevent     access to content, however, it may make it near impossible for some     users (e.g., with short-term memory problems) to locate where they     were.       JG: At some point, inconvenience makes something unusable.       RS: Very large documents are a P1 problem.       Resolved: No change.    Issue 266       Resolved: This is covered by structure navigation.    Issue 267       CMN: The WG intentionally did not choose a relative priority rating     for this and other checkpoints related to Web content. In this case,     knowing the feature is there is critical to being able to learn to  use     the tool.       Resolved: This is critical for using the tool. No change.

      Hello,    Periodically I write summary emails about the UAGL   conformance issue. My last one [1] is from 6 January.  This summary should facilitate discussion at tomorrow's (29 Sep)  teleconf [2] where conformance is on the agenda. I would  like to settle the issue, if possible, during the teleconf  and include the results in the next draft, which I intend  to publish on Friday. [I would like us to use that draft  at the face-to-face meeting.]    1) Goals of the Guidelines.    Here are some goals of the Guidelines. Consensus on the  goals will help us resolve this issue. I would like to  document consensus on the goals at the 29 Sep teleconference.    Goal 1) The Guidelines should help developers create  tools accessible to an audience with diverse functional  requirements. The WG has consciously produced guidelines  that focus on general needs rather than the functional  requirements of a particular group of users.    Goal 2) The Guidelines should list requirements for  accessibility so that consumers can make informed decisions  about which tools will meet their needs.    Goal 3) The Guidelines should promote interoperability  between mainstream browsers and dependent assistive  technologies.    Goal 4) The Guidelines should be general enough to  be applicable to "user agents" (broadly defined)   today and tomorrow.     Goal 5) The Guidelines should be specific enough so that  concrete user needs are not obscured by generalities  (e.g., "I need to ensure one-key access, not general keyboard   configurability.")    It is likely that not everyone agrees with all of these goals  or I've left some out that people feel are important. Additions  and comments are encouraged.    2) Issues    Issue 1) I think that it is clear that we are trying to  ensure the accessibility of general tools, either by having  them implement required functionalities natively or by having  them export information and allow control by other software.   Is it possible to pursue this general project AND ensure that  the guidelines apply to tools designed for users with specific  functional needs? For almost a year we have tried to create  a conformance clause that includes as many tools as possible;  in each case we have created subsets of checkpoints to allow inclusion.  Means for determining which checkpoints must be satisfied have  been based on:        a) Supported media types [3]        b) User Interface profiles [4]        c) Graphical Desktop v. Dependent User agent [5]           Pro: Seems to allow us to express expectations,              notably on communication by mainstream browsers.         Con: Does this split apply in the real world?        d) Interoperable v. Stand-alone [6]           Pro: No need to define classes of user agents. Tools              can be largely accessible without necessarily being              interoperable (or is this a myth?).         Con: Allowing conformance without interoperability               undermines Goal 3.         Each proposal has its weaknesses (there are undoubtedly  others not listed her). I think the weaknesses arise  from the very project of trying to address targeted user  agent requirements in a set of guidelines designed to meet general   needs. The desire to include seems to require some sort of subsetting  and each attempt has proved imperfect. While I can't prove that  the reasoning is flawed, our difficulties suggest that the  goal of including targeted user agents should be revisited  and confirmed or not. Answering this question is probably the  key to resolving this issue.    Issue 2) If the Guidelines only address general purpose  browsers and do not list requirements for dependent user agents,  consumers will not know what solutions will work in practice.  The Guidelines will require that general purpose browsers communicate  through published APIs. However, this information alone will not tell  consumers which assistive technologies will work for them. We  won't discuss specific tools in the Guidelines anyway, but a functional  requirement on a mainstream browser may not be the only way  an assistive technology can solve a problem. We hope it will  improve the chances of solving problems, but by not addressing  both sides of the equations, we may be weakening our own efforts.  In short: general guidelines may not help consumers in search  of specialized tools (except by suggesting what features to  look for in solutions that require general tools as well).    Issue 3) Developers of assistive technologies may want  more than just a set of guidelines that requires communication  from general purpose user agents. They may also want to be  able to say "We conform to the UA Guidelines." What weight  should we accord this (perceived) marketing requirement? Obviously  input from assistive technology vendors has been vital to this  process. What outcome do they expect? What can we provide?    Issue 4) At what point is too much flexibility in the guidelines  a bad thing? We have attempted to make the guidelines  flexible (for today's technologies and tomorrow's) by building  in interpretability. We use the term "applicable checkpoint"   so that vendors can make common-sense declarations about what  checkpoints simply don't apply to them (based on content type,  content controllability, supported input or output API, etc.).   However, if we build in too much flexibility in   the definition of "applicability" or elsewhere, in the end we   could create guidelines where a tool  could conform to relatively few checkpoints simply by claiming  that the majority don't apply. If 80% of the checkpoints don't  apply, then clearly the Guidelines as a whole don't apply  (even though the 12 principles stated by the Guidelines themselves  probably do). We should not weaken the Guidelines by twisting  them to allow conformance in cases where few checkpoints  are actually satisfied.    Issue 5) Today's assistive technology is tomorrow's operating  system or browser feature. How do we design the Guidelines so  that we don't exclude functionalities that may be specific  today but won't be in upcoming generations of general  purpose browsers?    I hope this summary will help us close this issue in  a timely manner.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0017.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0427.html  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0342.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1998OctDec/0344.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0110.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0375.html      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

IJ2: I think that's covered by checkpoint 11.5, which is a list of  functionalities that must have bindings (in the default configuration).   And then we have a requirement (11.3) that the user be able to override  the default bindings. So 11.5 is the WG's list of important  functionalities. After these basic ones, we stopped because we  are expecting diverse user agents to conform, and we can't  really predict every function that will be useful for a particular  type of user agent.

[Priority 2] Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out of context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links. Link text should also be terse. For example, in HTML, write "Information about version 4.3" instead of "click here". In addition to clear link text, content developers may further clarify the target of a link with an informative link title (e.g., in HTML, the "title" attribute).  >   >      Specifically, when I tab from link to link, all I hear is the checkpoint number, clearly meaningless if you don't happen to already know what topic that checkpoint addresses.    I disagree. It was a conscious choice to not repeat the word  "Checkpoint" in every link text.  That's because once you hit the checkpoints, the links are *all*  checkpoints. Thus, it  suffices to hear the number to distinguish one link from another.  Repeating the word  "checkpoint" 70 times seemed like overkill.    > Further, I would like to see this moved to a priority 1, since what good is information if you cannot determine its meaning because the information is out of context?    The reason this is not priority 1 is that access to the information is  not impossible  if the link target is not clearly identified - you can still follow the  link to   figure out whether the target is of interest. This is a burden, thus  easily meriting  priority 2 level, but the resource is still available even in the face  of bad link text.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Most definitely so. I believe the document already emphasizes  this point:             "Implement the !important rule as defined in CSS2           ([CSS2], section 6.4.2).

      Hello,     As per my action item of [1], here's a proposal for new  wording for checkpoint 4.12 of [2].    Old Text:       4.12 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of frames. [Priority    New Text:       4.12 Allow the user to choose between a frameset or its          alternative supplied by the author.             Note. For example, in HTML, allow the user to                choose between a frameset or a NOFRAMES                alternative. The ability to control frames is                 important for users with screen readers and users                 with some cognitive impairments.     Note that in this formulation, there is no reference  to "turning frames on or off".     At no extra cost, here's a proposed addition to checkpoint 8.1    Current Text:      8.1 Allow the user to navigate viewports (including frames).    Note. Navigating into a viewport makes it the current viewport.    Proposed addition to the beginning of the Note:     For example, when all frames of a frameset are displayed   side-by-side, allow the user to navigate among them  with the keyboard. Or, when frames are displayed individually  (e.g., by a text browser or speech synthesizer), provide  a list of links to individual frames.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/09/wai-ua-telecon-19990915.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990827/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I've published the 13 November version of the UAAG 1.0  implementation report [1]. This contains some information  that was provided by the Working Group since the 1 November  draft [2]. Some suggestions were not included because they  didn't include specific enough information (version, platform,  evidence of claim).    Some of the information in this version may still be inaccurate  or false. Some of the information is out-of-date because we  changed the checkpoints over the last six months, and the  more specific requirements may not be addressed, whereas the  more general requirements of the Proposed Recommendation may  have been met.    Here are most of the checkpoints where additional implementation  information is required: 1.5, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7,  4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.18, 4.19, 4.20, 4.21, 5.6, 5.8, 7.6, 7.7,  8.3, 8.6, 8.9, 8.10, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.8, 10.1, 10.2, and 10.5.    As you can read, at least 34 checkpoints out of 82 require   additional documentation of implementation experience.    Notes:       - If we have sufficient implementation experience, we can ask      the Director to advance the document straight to Proposed      Recommendation.      - Some implementation data may be Team-confidential and will      not appear in the implementation report.      - In making our case to the Director, I think there will be      several categories of checkpoints and varying degrees of      expectations about how much implementation experience is      required. For instance:        a) Checkpoints where implementation experience is gained by         virtue of the W3C Process. For instance, if we make a DOM         requirement, the fact that there is a DOM Recommendation         means that that WG has already gotten sufficient implementation         experience and we can (possibly) "reuse" that.         b) Checkpoints where we probably don't need implementation         experience, though it would still be good. For instance,         requirements that documentation conform to WCAG 1.0. I think         that if some product doesn't yet conform to WCAG but we are         comfortable with WCAG, then we should not have to wait until         a user agent's documentation conforms. Even though that would         be great!        c) Technical and functional requirements. These, I think, are the         ones where implementation is crucial.        d) Observation of system conventions. Since that's outside of         this document, how much is expected of us?        - Of course, the more implementation experience we have for      user agents targetted by this document, the better. There may      be software that meets some of the requirements but is not      meant to conform. That's ok, but not as good as a mainstream      graphical user agent or media player meeting the requirements.     _ Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20001113/  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20001101  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

My short answer to  your comments is that conformance to the Guidelines is meant  for one user agent at a time.  UA conforms on its own, not in   conjunction with other software. From section 1.6 on conformance:             "User agents must satisfy natively all the applicable                                      ^^^^^^^^           checkpoints for a chosen conformance level."    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/#conformance    Of course, for marketing purposes, companies can vaunt how tools  used in combination satisfy all of the checkpoints. While accessible  and useful, such a claim would not meet the conformance   requirements of this version of the User Agent Guidelines.   For some background about this discussion and decision,  please refer to this summary [2] of conformance issues.    The conformance statement of this document has been designed for  general purpose user agents, not specialized tools. To avoid  the dependencies you describe below (e.g., works with one  screen reader but not with another), we decided that conformance  would not include tools used in combination.    Let me know if this clarifies the issue you raised, and thanks  again for your review.     - Ian    [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0433.html     > As the developer of a user agent that is meant to make   > pure web graphics more accessible to totally blind users  > (see the URL below), I foresee several rather fundamental  > problems in defining the conformance levels, such as "A",   > "Double-A" and "Triple-A", and in using these to gauge  > whether or not my agent complies with these conformance   > levels.  >   > My user agent in practice needs both the basic operating  > system features and a "good" screen reader to be "fully  > accessible" to blind users.

      Hi Rob,    Thank you for the comments! Mine replies are preceded by IJ:    I hope that by this email I can clear up some points. I   also indicate which comments I have added to the WG's  issues list. If there are other comments you feel need  to be considered formal issues, please let me know.    Some of my comments request additional information.

IJ: I have two proposals to address this:     a) Incorporate the appropriate requirements directly into SMIL   2.x and dispense with conformance to UAAG 1.0. UAAG 1.0 may lose   some visibility this way, but the end result may ultimately   benefit the community more since the accessibility requirements   will be part and parcel of the other requirements.     b) Use "partial evaluation": Put as much as possible of the   well-formed conformance claim directly in the SMIL 2.x   specification. Someone claiming conformance to SMIL 2.x would   "inherit" the static part of the claim, and only have to provide   the dynamic information (e.g., user agent version info). For   example, a well-formed conformance claim to UAAG 1.0 requires   the URI and title of the document. Declare these in SMIL 2.x so   that any claim of conformance to SMIL 2.x would inherit them   automatically.    > Many features, though useful, are expensive, and thus when standardized  > minimal conformance claims are issued, it would be very good to ensure that  > either a cost/benefit analysis is done, or that cost/benefit is somehow  > implicit from the process (e.g. through the two interoperable  > implementation rule).    IJ: Are you suggesting that the UAWG do as much as or more than  any other W3C Working Group? I'm not aware (but I could be wrong)  that other Working Groups have to analyze the cost of  implementation.  Implementability is certainly important, but  cost analysis is not part of the W3C Process.     > Our biggest problems were with sections 6.1 and 6.2 (DOM conformance), so  > I'd like to call that out now.  >   > Below are comments with specific sections.

IJ: This is intended for users who access content serially (e.g.,  users who are blind and using speech synthesis or Braille  output). If junk is rendered (namely junk characters), these  users may have to "wade through it" until they get to useful  content. This checkpoint is designed to cut out the junk.    > 3.1  Hopefully not applicable to SMIL, since there's no concept of a  > "background image" in the same way that HTML has this.

Unlike HTML, *all* media (text included) is done as included media  > which the SMIL engine itself has little knowledge of.    IJ: Here's how I imagine it happening: the SMIL player is  configured not to render video, for example. So instead of  handing off video to whatever piece of software handles video,  the SMIL player renders a placeholder instead. The video may be  rendered on request by invoking the same video player manually    Is that an incorrect view of the world?    > 3.3  Seems mutually exclusive with 2.5.

These are cross-disability  guidelines, so different checkpoints are intended to help users  with different disabilities. It is likely that users would not  want all of the required configurations "on" in all  circumstances.  It doesn't mean that the checkpoints contradict  each other, however.    > 3.4 & 3.5  Our player is all about dynamic content (audio/video enhanced by  > other media) and all content is handled in one plugin or another, so  > clarification of the applicability of this particular checkpoint would be  > useful.

IJ: Checkpoint 3.4 does *not* include plug-ins (and this should  be made clearer. The checkpoint refers to excecutable content,  and plug-ins (in this document's model) are not content: they are  components of the conforming user agent. The user chooses to  install or not install plug-ins. This is different from having  applets buried in content.    For 3.5, is the "protocol" for the real player this:     a) Client requests content   b) Server starts sending content and doesn't stop until      the client says so, or there's an error, or the server      doesn't have any more content.    In this case, I would argue that the initial request for content  is the only one from the client. Thus, there is no client-side  content refresh.    Or, is the scenario different, and the client software issues  periodic requests for content? This is the scenario we intend to  cover by checkpoint 3.5.    I welcome your comments on how it really works...    > 3.6  Not sure why distinction between client-side and server-side redirects  > is useful.

IJ: Server-side redirects are not controlled by the  client. Therefore, there's nothing the client can do about  it. Client-side redirects are controlled by the client.    > 3.7  Not as applicable to SMIL as HTML.

If the SMIL engine has been configured to not  render images, when it encounters an <img> element, it can render  a placeholder instead. SMIL engines should have control at this  level since they do things like lay out content.  So they can lay  out a placeholder instead of calling another piece of software.    Please let me know whether this is indeed how a SMIL engine would  work.    > 3.8  Ok  >   > 4.1  Does the RealPlayer "Zoom" feature qualify here?

IJ: Added as issue 506:     http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#506    I think your comment applies to any checkpoint (e.g., 4.1, 4.2,  4.3) where we require "one value" and there might be N  viewports. Would it address your concern if one could satisfy the  checkpoint by doing *better* than a single setting? For instance,  if one could set the text size for each viewport (read: each  rendering component), that would still meet the accessibility  need of having bigger text/ control over colors and font  families.    > 4.3  Since there's no single identifiable "background color" for text in  > SMIL, this is rather difficult (no global color, only on a per region  > basis).  HTML also has this problem with tables.    IJ: Added as issue 507     http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#507    Does it make sense to say "please use this as the background  color for all regions" in the case of SMIL? That would probably  satisfy the spirit of this checkpoint.    If that makes sense, perhaps some clarification is possible.    > 4.4  Very costly feature.

See Ian's meeting minutes for some examples:  > http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0044.html    IJ: Your input here on the technical difficulties is critical for  our Working Group as we do not have the expertise that you  do. Can you say a little more about what is difficult:     a) Slowing down video? Audio? Both together?    b) Synchronization issues?   c) Streaming issues?    > 4.5  Difficult feature.

IJ: It is my understanding that this checkpoint does *not*  require the user agent to play the content faster than the at the  specified rate. I do not believe that the fast forward  functionality is required to do playback as well - only advance  the viewport through the content to another point in time. Of  course, faster playback is a more useful feature.    Please indicate whether your player allows the user to jump  forward in time, and whether you consider that a reasonable  requirement.    As issue 508, I will ask the WG to clarify their expectations  about whether fast playback is required by this checkpoint    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#508    > Just offering seeking support on rectangular region  > animations doesn't seem terribly useful, and creating a programmatic  > interface to datatype plugins that support animations for rewind and  > fast-forward rendering is very difficult.

IJ: Because UAAG 1.0 is format and platform independent, we are  not able to say: use API Y on platform Z. We must live with a  certain amount of ambiguity, which we hope translates as  flexibility. We point out this feature/limitation in the  definition of "API":     "... this document does not define in all cases how those APIs are   standardized (i.e., whether they are defined by specifications such   as W3C Recommendations, defined by an operating environment vendor,   de facto standards, etc.)."    I think that certification is not impossible. Platforms have  guidelines for APIs, and it would be fairly easy to document that  an API has been widely adopted, or formally standardized, or is  part of guidelines for implementing on a particular platform.     > 6.4 Programmatic read/write access to user agent controls - Doable for most  > controls, but becomes pretty unfunctional as the complexity of the controls  > increases.  >   > 6.5 Programmatic alert of changes to content, user interface controls,  > selection, content focus, and user interface focus - the granularity of  > notification would need to be defined in order to understand the cost of  > providing conformance.

IJ: Added as issue 510    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#510    I believe we've discussed this before, but I think that the WG  should confirm (and state clearly in the document) how  cross-platform considerations and following conventions interact.     > 6.8 For an API implemented to satisfy this doc, support the character  > encodings required for that API. - this is rather vaguely worded, and if we  > understand, doesn't add anything.

IJ: Yes. This is exactly the case.

A generalized, robust way of  > implementing a history mechanism for plugins is not easy.    IJ: UAAG 1.0 does *not* require that the user agent implement a  history mechanism. Only that if implemented, it must satisfy the  requirements of checkpoint 9.3. I believe this is editorial and  should be clarified. The checkpoint used to say "For user agents  that implement a history mechanism..." and it appears as though  this type of statement would make the checkpoint clearer.    Note that checkpoint 11.5 confirms this: if a history mechanism  is implemented, the default input configuration must include  bindings to go back and forth in the history (of each viewport).     > 10.1 states "This checkpoint refers only to table information that the user  > can recognize"...

Strictly speaking, the sentence isn't necessary at all, but some  checkpoints have been questioned so often, we have special  reminders in their Notes. But applicability works for all the  checkpoints.    > 10.2: In theory this is a reasonable demand; however, it may need SMIL  > clarifications--there's no general purpose way to inform visually of focus  > and linked areas in SMIL.    IJ: Can you explain what you mean by "there's no general purpose  way"? Is that for reasons cited above: different handlers handle  different media types? If that's the case, it's up to each  handler to include a focus mechanism.     > 10.3: This seems reasonable, but rather unprecedented in all current  > browsers.

IJ: The format doesn't support the notion of recently visited link;  it's the user agent that tracks what the user has visited recently.     It may be unprecedented, but it may also be very inaccessible that  way.     > 10.7: see 10.2 comments.  >   > 11.1: Excellent recommendation  >   > 12.1  Excellent recommendation  > 12.2  Excellent recommendation  > 12.3  Excellent recommendation  >   > We hope this helps.

      Hello,    At the 25 May teleconference [1], I got an action to write a proposal  to address issues 506 [2].    The following checkpoints require a "global configuration": 2.3, 4.1,  4.2, 4.3, 4.9, and 10.2.     The question raised by the reviewer was: when a user agent is a series  of modules, how does the user agent ensure that a single configuration  exists that satisfies the checkpoints in question? For instance,  if I add a plug-in and that plug-in doesn't know about my global  setting for reference text size, do I lose conformance?    I think that the answer is that a single global configuration is a  sufficient, but not necessary, technique to satisfy the six  checkpoints in question. I think, for example, that it is more  important for the user to be able to enlarge text than it is to do so  with a single configuration (in one place). It is preferable to only  have to configure this once. But if I add a plug-in to my user agent,  and that plug-in lets me configure the reference size of text, then  that, in my opinion, satisfies the intended requirement of 4.1.    In the 25 May draft [3], the glossary reads:      "In this document, the term global configuration is used to    emphasize when a configuration applies across Web resources."    This language does not limit the possiblity that the user might have  to configure several modules, as long as for each module, the  configuration has an effect across resources.    Therefore, I propose to address this issue by simply stating in the  document that a "global configuration" is one that:     a) Applies across Web resources (at least of the same type).   b) May be implemented by one or more settings in the user agent.   c) Where possible, a global configuration should be implemented      by one setting.    An optional piece of the proposal: change "global configuration"  to "cross-resource configuration" in the text.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0217  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#506  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010525/    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783

Yes, if I understand what you mean.    The short explanation is:    1) This document is not meant for ATs, it's meant for graphical  user agents intended to work with ATs.    2) This document does not prevent AT developers from claiming  conformance.  But based on the requirements of the document and what we heard from  AT developers (e.g., about implementing the DOM) that's unlikely to  happen.     - Ian     > Charles McCN  >   > On Mon, 21 Aug 2000, Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   >   Eric and I just finished a conversation about his proposals and  >   I would like to summarize what I believe to be our agreement about  >   the proposals.

      Hello,    The last call review [1] for UAAG 1.0 ends today. We won't haggle  over the time of day since we welcome your comments! However, we  need to receive them soon so that we can prepare our face-to-face  meeting agenda, where we will address last call comments.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0140.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

SUMMARY OF NEW ACTION ITEMS:     Ian: Send proposal to list to propose 9 July Draft (with        today's changes) to IG.     Ian: Add checkpoint about default keyboard configs not        interfering with system conventions. (See details below).

Ian: Propose rationale text for guideline 1 explaining relationship        between input mechanisms and system conventions.     Ian: - Fix section 3.1 conformance reference to Priority 1.        - review section on "through other software".     Ian: Ensure that discussion of face-to-face on next agena      Judy: Announce new charter to UAGL WG with         deadline for comments by email or in next Weds'         teleconf. After that, take to w3c management.    AGENDA [1], [2]  [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0013.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0017.html    Agenda 1) Review of changes in 12 July Draft of UAGL       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990709/changes       Jim/Harvey/Glen read changes list.    Agenda 2) Proposed: Send WD to IG.       No objections.       Action: Send proposal to list.    Agenda 3) Review of keyboard proposal from Rich [1]:         "Avoid default configurations that interfere           with system conventions."        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0240.html       Resolved: Add proposed checkpoint as Priority 2.               Include an example (ctrl-alt-delete) after checkpoint       Action editor:       - Add this checkpoint       - Add info to Techniques:         (For Windows)          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0000.html       - Add  fromhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0240.html             a) Navigation order             b) Tabbing information is for for Java.             c) Tab groupings       HB: This suggests that we need to link to where special key         definitions are defined.       RS: OS-specific keyboard events are generally intercepted         by the OS, not rerouted to applications.       HB: But one OS's system command is another's application command.       RS: This is all very OS-specific. More complicated on X where         you have your own window manager.       GG: MS has lists of "access keys" and "system keys".       Action Harvey: Ask Len Kasday for links to pages where OS         system keyboard conventions are documented. Also, send reference          to infamous 600 combinations.    Agenda 4)  Proposed Note for checkpoint 1.1 on device-independent             input.             http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0011.html       HB: Do any OS do this?       RS: Not that I'm aware of.       GG: Windows 2000 is apparently shipping an on-screen keyboard.       RS: This would be the first OS I know of that does this.        JA: Some applications do this (HotMetal), but this is the         exception, not the rule.       IJ: Does the on-screen keyboard solve problems?       RS: Helpful for mobility-impaired. For serial keys, you wouldn't         be required to have an on-screen keyboard.       IJ: Should dependent UAs be required to do this?       RS: I think it would depend on the AT's purpose.       IJ: For me, a conformance issue - do you fail 1.1 if you         don't allow text input through the mouse?       RS: Do you make the UA provide this or the OS?       GG: The UA doesn't have to do this, but must be compatible         with third-party software that does this.       General consensus that UA shouldn't be required to provide     on-screen keyboard.        RS: On-screen keyboards are important for some groups of users.         Need to float on the screen without interfering with         applications. Should be provided by the OS (in the future).       GG: Why is this different from saying a mainstream browser        should be a screen reader?       RS: Right.       GG: Don't need to say that every browser should be self-voicing,         for example.       RS: DOM is hard-coded for mouse/keyboard input. No abstractions         for other input devices. In PF WG, we're working on expanding         this.       Proposed:     User agents must be able to respond to any type of     input generated for a standard device (e.g., mouse, keyboard)     by the operating system or another user agent.       Input device independence means "any standard input mechanism     supported by the operating system".        IJ: What's the list of the input mechanisms?       GG: Mouse and keyboard. Other input mechanisms use these.          RS: What about PDA? Use their own system conventions, so ok.       Action Ian: Propose new text for this.                  Questions: OS-conventions only? "All" supported input  devices.                 JA: Do this in the rationale section.       Action Ian: - Fix section 3.1 conformance reference to Priority 1.                    - review section on "through other software".    Agenda 5) Charter changes [Judy]       JB described charter renewal process.        JB described proposed changes:       a) Cosmetic (add links, some text, etc.)     b) WG charter through May 2000.     c) Deliverables:          - Guidelines (in various states)          - Techniques          - Post-Recommendation report on implementation            progress and recommendations for future work.          - Meeting minutes     d) Add comments about success criteria (deliverable         completion, implementation experience, or broad        commitment to implementation).      GG: Don't we have fewer and bigger players than WCAG?      JB: Operasoft is very small but very serious about        accessibility. Size doesn't necessarily matter - timing        of release is important. You might want to aim for        commitment to implementation.       e) Dependencies/Relations with other groups.        - WAI WGs are obvious.        - Other W3C WGs, primarily coordinated through WAI PF.        - Other W3C WGs explicitly: DOM, MathML,          SYMM, HTML, CC/PP (content negotation model),           Voice Browsers, CSS.           (Judy will highlight PF involvement)       f) Estimated Milestones         Last call: End of Aug         Proposed Rec: End October         Rec: Beginning December.       g) Communication mechanisms.        To discuss at another meeting:          - Proposed face-to-face in Sept or Oct. Need to            make this concrete soon if desired.          Action Ian: Ensure this makes it to next telecon agenda.       h) Time commitment of participants          - Active members of WG will be required to reregister as per:          http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#JoinGroups           (in response to the call for participation).          - IPR disclosure required. (Probably not a lot of IPR clashes          likely).             (Refer to process document:              http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ipr)            JB: Are the guidelines drawing off of IPR of other guidelines?              Doesn't seem to be the case.             JB: For example, a Member might disclose a particular interface              they might have a patent on, but this wouldn't affect              the guidelines.      Conclusion: People are ok with conclusions about charter changes                discussed.      Action Judy: Announce new charter to UAGL WG with                 deadline for comments by email or in next Weds'                 teleconf. After that, take to w3c management.

JG: Scroll bars are important.       IJ: This is in the definition of "viewport". I don't think this         needs to be a UA Guidelines requirement since it affects         all users.       Resolved: No need to include a "scrollbar note" since               it's in the definition of viewport.       Proposed: One goal of 2.1 is to make equivalent alternatives               readily available in the same view.       AG: Does this cause us to exceed the scope of Guideline 2?         The proper composition of views gets into presentation,          whereas G2 is just about exposure (you have to get to         it).       IJ: I see no problem with moving it to another checkpoint.       AG: You might want to organize the objective of          "staying close to the author's view" in another checkpoint.          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0269.html       /* Discussion of view as a "take on the data" (e.g., table of        contents view) */       AG: The term "view" in the database community means something         different: checklist of what's presented.       Resolved:      Split 2.1 into:        1) Ensure that the user has access to all content.                 2) Make equivalent alternatives readily available            in the same view.       IJ: 'The term view is used in this document to describe the           purpose of a particular rendering (e.g., "outline view", "table          of contents view", "links view").'       AG: The user agent must support permutations of an object         ('equivalents') within the same view.       AG: I think the objectives are valid, but may need to          go somewhere outside of G2.        Proposed: Provide synchronized views of content.               (In the sense of coordinated but different views                of the same content.)       JG: Should this be a checkpoint to make it easier to         find information in views? Or just a technique?        IJ:       1) If you have synchronized views, you are supposing at         least two views. What are those views?       MN: Most browsers already provide at least one view.        GR: It's important that synchronization is important if you         provide an outline view.        GR: Issue of different levels of detail in views and how         those are coordinated.       JG: Both Amaya and Jaws offer synchronized views.       JG: Are synchronized views important for accessibility?       GR: Yes.          DA: Yes, but P2.       DP: Yes, at least P2. E.g., from a link list, you need         to be able to find out where the link occurs on the page.       MN: I can see accessibility issues, but not sure this         requirement part of G2.       JG: Maybe part of the orientation guideline.       KB: Without having views synchronized, the value of the         additional view might be substantially lowered.       IJ: I think this a new requirement and would pretty         much guarantee that we will have to go back to last call.       KB: (to GR) What additional functionality would this requirement         offer that's not covered in other checkpoints?       GR: What's missing is that there's no explicit requirement that         alternative views be synchronized with an original view.          I think it's also related to point of regard.       IJ: We also need to consider the impact of how focus is         controlled among synchronized views.       JG: How crucial is this requirement for UAAG 1.0? Can it wait?       /* IJ forwards that a last call means we might get to Rec        at the beginning of September */       Resolved:         - Add a checkpoint to G8          requiring synchronized views when more than one.        - Review this change alongside other changes to the document.        - Evaluate later whether this is the make-or-break checkpoint          for advancing quickly; decide then whether to keep it.       JG: We might also consider highlighting this as part of 8.6,         then making a more general requirement in another version.       Proposed: Add access to only the attributes of a selected               element.       JG: I withdraw this proposal since I've not heard much support         for it.       AG: I think this is a useful technique, though.       Action IJ: Add this as a technique.       IJ: By the way, how have we resolved the original question         about a source view?       AG: Move all discussion of source view and property inspection to         techniques discussion in the guidelines document.           This section should say the following things:            - Property inspection is expected to be significantly more             usable than source view for many properties.              - Source view may be the most usable readily-achievable view             for some content such as embedded fragments of style and             script languages.         (quoted from          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0269.html)       JG: A source view is part of a solution, but is not a solution         in itself.       Resolved: A source view is part of a solution for providing               access to content, but is not a sufficient solution               on its own.       IJ: The question from the start, to me, was          "how much content has to be made available through the          primary view"? How have we answered that?       IJ: I've heard us answer "we draw the line at alt content"          in the primary view. And the rest of the content         is available through the sum of all views.       AG: Yes.         Action IJ: Update the document with these resolutions.    4) PR#233: Checkpoint 7.6: What does "structure" mean here?     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#233       AG: I propose that in techniques we move away from         headers as containers and towards headers as good         starting points. The guideline should be to use         what the author gave you as structural clues (even         in preference over what the spec says). I think that         the DOM as the basis of doc structure is insufficient         (due to real-world "mis"-usage). Use what the         author gave you.               AG: You can even reasonably guess that headers used to         change font sizes are still important starting point.       AG: User agents should be encouraged to provide navigation         among starting points marked up by the user. Headers         or structuring elements such as forms and tables.            E.g., MAP with a "title" for navbars.       IJ: What's the minimal requirement if we ask user agents         to do what is not defined in the spec?       AG: I'm not suggesting that we should require UAs to         follow heuristics. Only to accept that this document         will not meet all requirements, and that we have to         address repair strategies and possibly consider more         in later versions.          AG: However, you can do a lot to call out important         elements/structures in the techniques document. The         HTML spec may not go far enough to highlight what's important         for structured navigation.       DP: I think Phill has said that you have to remain close         to what the markup language spec says. I think we are         saying "If a document conforms to WCAG, please render         it appropriately."       IJ Summarizing:       - Minimal requirement is navigation of document structure.         (elements). However, you need to add filtering before         its useful.        - This will not solve all accessibility problems today due         to how markup is used in practice that doesn't conform         to specs.       - We should not try to solve all these problems in this         version.        AG: Minimal requirement is navigation of document structure.          (elements). However, you need to add filtering before          its useful.         IJ: What about the proposal from last week?          "Allow the user to navigate efficiently to            significant parts of content."?        AG: Yes, I like the idea of including something about          some of the goals.         AG: Hitting the high spots is only part of structured          navigation. Tables is an exception. But in general,          the table of contents structure will do: and the          definition is recursive (what is important changes          as you change contexts, go deeper).    /* RS joins */        Proposed: "Allow the user to navigate efficiently to                  significant parts of content."               NOTE: "significant" changes as you navigate.        AG: Hit both TOC and table example in the proposal.           Action IJ: Propose checkpoint rewording to list.    5) PR#279: Proposal to resolve formal objection to Checkpoint 9.2     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#279       Refer to RS proposal:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0232.html       RS: I wouldn't mind leaving 9.2 as is and stating that          to minimally satisfy the requirement, a user agent          can prompt for all form submissions. I looked at IE, and         based on what they have, it doesn't look difficult to do.       IJ: I agree that RS's proposal would satisfy the requirement         of 9.2.       Resolved: Leave checkpoint as is. Checkpoint satisfied               if the user can configure prompts for all form               submissions.       Action IJ: Modify document accordingly.    --  Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Marco,    This mailing list is used by the User Agent Guidelines Working  Group for discussions about Web accessibility. I recommend that  for future questions about rendering, you consult the HTML [1]   and CSS [2] home pages for information about markup and styling.

"All  > user interface functionality but not input" sounds contradictory.    A couple of comments    1) "Observable". There are a number of checkpoints known to be difficult  to verify but that are nonetheless important to do. For these  checkpoints,  claimants will probably have to rely on claims from developers of  support for "all" functionalities through "all" supported APIs.    2) The checkpoint is clearly meant to address the "big"   functionalities offered by the user agent. For the very small  funtionalities of how you actually enter text or move the cursor,  the user agent is not required to simulate one input method with another  input method. That's the exception case called out in 1.1. I don't think  there's a contradiction there, only a narrowing of scope.     - Ian     > Checkpoint 9.4 is of some help in reducing the confusion.  >   > Al  > --  > Usage in headers.

      Hello,    I've published the 7 May UA Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]  documents, incorporating resolutions to Proposed Recommendation  issues. These are both Working Drafts for Working Group review  to determine whether the resolutions of the Working Group  have been accurately recorded.     I have begun to edit the list of changes [3] but have  only finished about 75% of the changes; I'll finish the list  tonight.    I have spent more effort on the Guidelines this round than  the Techniques, so there are a handful of Techniques that  have not yet been integrated.    Also, I did not add a checkpoint about synchronized views.  Please refer to my email on this topic [4]. The document  does contain two proposals that have not yet been approved  by the Working Group ([5], [6], [7]).    I think this draft incorporates almost all of the other  issue resolutions. I does not address the issue of minimal conformance  (issue 257), which is still open.    I will send more comments as they occur to me.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000507  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000507  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0300.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0288.html  [6] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0297.html  [7] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0287.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    I've just published the 8 March 2000 versions of the   UA Guidelines [1], Techniques [2], and Implementation Report [3].    I apologize for the delays, but I hope the results will  make it worth the wait. I realize that there isn't much  time before tomorrow's meeting, but please try to review  the Guidelines before the teleconference tomorrow [4]. I would  like to ensure that this draft represents the resolutions  to issues raised during Candidate Rec.    I did not have time to write, edit, and   incorporate long descriptions into this version of the techniques  document. I realize this is important and will do this as soon as  possible.    Still to come:     - A list of changes for the Guidelines. I won't put together     a list of changes to the Techniques since this was a major     overhaul.   - Updated impact matrix.   - I may update the UA responsibilities document.

      Hello,    Web Content Guidelines Issue 10 (refer to [1]) concerns the use of   deprecated features of HTML vs. use of CSS for style (e.g.,  borders around images).    Although we want the guidelines to send the message "use style sheets",   they must also take into account the current support for CSS. There  have been some questions on the list about how to satisfy  the following checkpoints at the same time:     - 3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2]      - 11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate          for a task and use the latest versions when supported. [Priority  2]      - 11.2 Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies. [Priority 2]     I propose the following changes to improve the situation:     a) Change wording of 3.3 to say "Use style sheets to control      layout and presentation when supported by user agents."     b) Change priority of 11.2 to 3     c) Change wording of 11.2 to read "Avoid deprecated features of      W3C technologies. Note: Authors should stop using deprecated      features when they are supported by by other technologies such      as style sheets."    - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-issues.html#g11  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     (212) 684-1814        

      Regrets? I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention  (except for Jon Gunderson and Jim Allan). Please let me know   whether you expect to be on the 15 June call (agenda [1]).    Thanks,     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0475.html      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      User Agent Teleconference  25 August 1999    Present:  Jon Gunderson  Ian Jacobs  Glen Gordon  Mark Novak  David Poehlman  Harvey Bingham  Marja Kiovunen  Rich Schwertdfeger  Jim Allan  Gregory Rosmaita  Charles McCathieNevile    Regrets:    Denis Anson    Alan Cantor    Kitch Barnicle    Agenda [1]    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0174.html    0) For requests by Jon to RSVP, please respond privately to Jon     or Ian.    Agenda 1) Review of Action items:       1.JG: Run IE through guidelines.

Status: Not done.      11.IJ: Propose reordering to the list.      Status: Done.      12.IJ: Issue 56 resolution        a) Mention media objects as example in checkpoint 1.6.        b) List as example in checkpoint 9.6        c) Incorporate media objects into 10.5 and 10.6.      Status: Not done.      13.HB, RS: Look at techniques document.      HB Status: Pending.     HB Status: Pending.      14.HB: Run PWWebSpeak (with Mark H.) through the guidelines.      HB Status: Installed it and using it. For next week.      15.GR: Run Hal + Windowize through the guidelines.      HB Status: Pending.      16.GR: Clarify your proposal on user agent configuration            for SELECT form control behavior.      Status: Done     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0151.html     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0129.html      17.DP: Technique 3.6 - Propose techniques      STatus: writing madly.      18.DP: Run Jaws for Windows through the guidelines.      Status: Pending. Lynx 32, IE, NN, and Opera!       GG: Are these results for internal review only?     IJ: Working group should decide ultimate scope:         a) At least Team/WG.         b) Member-visible for Proposed Rec.         c) Should they be visible when we go to Recommendation?         CMN: I think it's public by charter requirement.     JG: Yes, anything posted to the list is public.      DP: When AFB did evaluation, we sent results to manufacturer         for comments before publication. We should consider         this to encourage (notably assistive technology) developers         to move towards conformance.       MK: But is the goal to evalute the guidelines or the product?       IJ: I propose linking to these reviews from the WG home page         with a proper disclaimer that these comments don't reflect         consensus.       GG: This issue arose since our beta product does a better job         than what's on the street.       No objections. Action Ian:         a) Add links to WG page with disclaimer about           volatility of Working Drafts and products.        b) Proposed disclaimer to be inserted in evaluations.           Reviewers should be as specific as possible about           product versions, os versions, etc.      19.KB: Fill in the table for UAGL and coordinate with Wendy.           Deadline for this action 2 weeks.     Status: Pending.      20.CMN: Run Amaya through guidelines.     Status: Done    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0178.html      21.GG: Review proposal for techniques for accessing content.     Status: Not done.      22.RS: Coordinate review of HomePage reader.     Status: Done. Review pending.    Agenda 2) Dependent user agents that may also be considered            stand-alone user agents.       RS: For at least 40% of the checkpoints: If you're developing     a technology like PWWebspeak, market is users with blindness.     So, turn on/off blinking images should not be imposed     since not applicable.       JG: The spec says that if you don't support a particular     technology (e.g., images) the checkpoint doesn't apply.       RS: What if you do visual rendering also? What if you      render the Web page as would be seen by general user?      CMN: Like emacsspeak.       GR: When you talk about visual view of HomePage Reader,     is this the text-only view, or general graphic view?       RS: You may want both.       GR: Specifically about HPR - when you are looking at       "Netscape view", this isn't controlled by HPR.       The text view is. I think that there may be a case       for a third-classification. There may be dependencies,       but in some rendering cases there may not be       control.         IJ: I think that the tool that provides the UI is       responsible for UI-related checkpoints.       GR: But onus may be on the rendering engine for        some checkpoints. I think there's a case for       more clarification or a third classification.       CMN: I don't agree. If HPR passes rendered info      untouch, that doesn't mean they wash their hands      of it.        IJ: Ian reads clause about applicability of          checkpoints.        IJ: Question: 1) Is the clause sufficiently visible?                    2) Does that cover the 40% you                      are concerned with?       CMN: For the record: I don't think two classes are useful.      IJ: Perhaps applicability clause is sufficiently          flexible that two classes aren't necessary, but           I hesitate to reopen that issue.       Action RS: Consider the "applicability clause"                and propose rewording.        Action RS: Post list of checkpoints at issue to the                list.                  Agenda 3)  Issue 3     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#3        Navigation/Grouping techniques. To be coordinated with     WCAG WG at teleconference tomorrow.      Agenda 4) Issue 58        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#58        Keyboard access to select form controls when there is an     ONCHANGE event handler attached to the control        Refer to GR's modified proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0151.html       RESOLVED: Modify checkpoint 10.6. Ian can edit the following      text from Gregory:        10.6 Prompt the user to confirm the submission of form content      if the submission mechanism is not explicitly activated by the       user. [Priority 2]        GR: Techniques in original proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0139.html    Agenda 5) Issue 63:       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#63         Checkpoint proposal from Marja to freeze time-sensitive content.         MK: Make available content that depends on time in a           time-independent manner. And allow people to "rewind"          time-sensitive content and find out temporal context          of particular content.           Same as issue 44, resolved last week to add a checkpoint for      time-sensitive active elements.      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0153.html        IJ: Do we need more than active elements?        JA: Is a media element considered an active element?        IJ: Covered by the multimedia checkpoints.        Resolved: For now, limit to active elements.        CMN: I'd like to link this issue back to the conformance           issue. It's unclear whether the SMIL player            conforms as a desktop graphical browser. If it doesn't           apply, who are we writing this checkpoint for.            Unclear from current conformance statement that the           guidelines apply to the SMIL player.     Agenda 6) Issue 73        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#73         Text rendering of client-side image maps         IJ: In HTML, "alt" is required on AREA. But other          ways to create image maps without requiring          text attributes. "title" may not be present.          These are techniques.        MK: I think we need this checkpoint.        GG: I disagree. Unless there's a way of indicating          that the text links are duplications. Suppose          that there's an AREA element without an "alt"          attribute. We may use the URL and thus speak          it twice.        GR: I agree with this concern. I'd rather           the dependent user agent get information from          the markup rather than the renderer get the          information from duplication.        IJ: These are links and so covered by checkpoint 1.2.        RESOLVED:        a) Don't add a new checkpoint.           This issue is covered by checkpoint 1.2        b) Highlight the case of image maps in comment after 1.2        c) Include techniques for image maps (e.g.,             getting alt text of image in link, using title,           getting external text media objects for SMIL.)        Action: IJ send proposal to WCAG to propose different              wording on the requirement for text rendering              by UAs.    Agenda 7) Issue 72       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#72         What should UAs do with metadata? (Asked for by WCAG 1.0).         IJ: Broad issue: might be keywords, supplemental info,           doc relationships, natural language, navigation           bar, Dublin Core, etc.          JG: Lynx, Amaya use LINK.         Action CMN: Talk to Dan Brickley about document structure          and site mapping. Will send a list of tools that          make use of this information.         GR: Another issue that keeps popping up for me in the          guidelines: a lot say "If this happens, do this."          Metadata one framework for this.         CMN: For list of links, metadata is the long way around.                JG: We need to have a list of metadata elements and          attributes in HTML, SMIL, also schemas. Perhaps          add checkpoints related to that which we don't          already cover.         (Source means element and attribute).         Action Marja: Compose list of metadata sources for SMIL.       Action   Ian: Compose list of metadata sources for HTML.       Action   Jim: Compose list of metadata sources for CSS.                     (e.g., generated text)       Action   CMN: Propose something about schemas.              Deadline two weeks.    Agenda 8) Issue 74:        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#74          Value of checkpoint on volume control.       Resolved last week.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0153.html    Agenda 9) Issue 75:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#75         Does accessible doc checkpoint apply to non Web-based docs?         Proposed: Add "electronic".      CMN: But must add that documentation must be available in           electronic form. "Ensure that there is a version of the           product documentation that conforms to WCAG 1.0"        Resolved: Change wording of 3.1 as per CMN's proposal.    Agenda 10) Configuration checkpoints.    GR: Two checkpoints proposed: one for links and one for        forms.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0127.html      JG: Will be on agenda for next week.    Agenda 11) Order of guidelines.      IJ: See proposal    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0185.html    DP: Add explanation of order.      Resolved: Implement this proposal with explanation in upcoming              draft.      Agenda 12) Reminders:    a) Next face-to-face in November. Meeting page:       http://www.w3.org/WAI/1999/10/ua-agenda      b) Following face-to-face in January      CMN: Does there need to be an implementation period         during or after Last Call?      Action CMN: Send proposal about this to the list.        

      Bryan,    Your comments seem very reasonable and I will make the suggested  change (unless there are strong objections). Fortunately, the text  you cite is in the Techniques Document, which we will only be  showing to the Director as a proposed Note, not Recommendation.  So I don't think we shall be slowed down a bit.

Does every resource on a website need to be accessible?    The answer to this question clearly depends on the scope of "need".  I don't think every Web site in the world "needs" to be accessible,   although it would be a good thing if all Web sites were.

Independent of the question of "need", according to the WCAG 1.0, all  information must be accessible. You can have 10 forms of the information  that offer the *equivalent* functionality, and 9 of them can be  inaccessible,   as long as the 10th one is accessible (as you point out below).     > Option 1 seems to be the current thinking of WAI in general (at least in my  > mind)  > Option 2 is acknowledged in Web Content with the provision of the text only  > page option for complex pages and in User Agent in the documentation  > section that says as least one version of the documentation must be accessible.  >   > Do you think this is the central issue being raised by Scott?  >   > Jon  >   > At 06:53 PM 3/14/00 -0500, Gregory J.

More specifically:     - The UA satisfies the requirement if disabled elements     are never in the navigation order, or      - The UA satisfies the requirement if there's a configuration so     that disabled elements do not appear in the navigation order.    > >Checkpoint 6.6:  I understand the need for standard APIs and documented APIs  > >for non-standard implementations.

      Hello,    I've published the 23 June 2000 versions of four techniques  documents (URIs below for main techniques, HTML, CSS,   and Non-W3C technologies). Although Wendy can let you know   in more detail how the documents have changed since the   15 June drafts, there are at least the following changes:     - There should be no broken links. There may be some     broken links temporarily, until W3C mirroring takes     care of some symbolic links in the file system.      - The documents should now be valid XHTML 1.0 documents.     - A style sheet bug has been fixed (to the best of my     knowledge).     - There are some other tweaks that have to do with     scripts, references, and updated copyright statement,     and some additional links.    Enjoy!     - Ian       Main Techniques:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000623/    HTML Techniques:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-HTML-TECHS-20000623/    CSS Techniques:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-CSS-TECHS-20000623/    Non-W3C Techniques:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-NONW3C-TECHS-20000623/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    The 29 September draft [1] includes definitions of "document  source" and "documetn source view":     | In this document, the term document source refers to the    | data that the user agent receives as the direct result of    | a request for a Web resource. A document source view    | represents all or part of a document in a way that exposes    | the markup language(s) used to build the Web resource.     | A source view often presents textual representations of    | content.     The term is only used twice in the document, in the note  after checkpoint 2.1:     | A document source view is an important part of a   | solution for providing access to content, but is not a    | sufficient solution on its own for all content.    and in the definition of "document object". Here's the proposal:    1) Delete the term "document source" from the spec     and saying "document object" instead in the note after 2.1:     | A document object view is an important part of a   | solution for providing access to content, but is not a    | sufficient solution on its own for all content.    2) Create a new definition of "document object view" based on     "document source view":     | A document object view represents all or part of the   | document object in a way that exposes the markup language(s)    | used to build it. A document object view often presents   | textual representations of content.    3) In the definition of "document object" change:         "This data generally comes from the document source..."    to:      "This data generally comes from markup..."    SUMMARY:    - The term "document source" is hard to define.   - We can get along with out it and use terms we already define.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000929  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Martin and I just reviewed (while he visits my home)  his internationalization (I18N) comments on the last call   draft of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines   (UAAG) 1.0:    http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    These are the raw notes from that discussion.   The points raised by Martin here should be considered  last call comments. In these notes, we have not yet   labeled issues to be formally addressed by the UA   Working Group.     People are encouraged to comment on these notes,  in particular to add either I18N or accessibility  perspectives. In particular, Max Nakane is invited  to provide further information about these issues  in the context of Japanese.    Thank you,     - Ian    =============================================  Charset information  =============================================  IJ: If it affects everyone equally, then we have a convention      not to include such requirements in such a document.    MD: In a US context, this isn't much of a problem. It's helpful  to point out to user agent developers, however, that this is  something that they should do.    MD: Here's why there's an impact on ATs:   - The DOM representation is always UTF-16.   - Therefore, the UA that constructs the DOM must do the     right thing in order for the AT to have access to characters,     not just bytes.    IJ: But if it's a DOM conformance issue, then we distribute that  to the DOM by virtue of requiring conformance to it.  /* On APIs */    MD: Each API probably has its own specific character encoding.  For instance, in Japan, there are three widely-used encodings.  When the UA passes information through an API, it must ensure  that the information is converted per the encoding rules of that  API. [The DOM is a special case of this.]    IJ: I see, so even if the DOM case is covered by  the conformance requirement, we do make more general API  requirements where we would not be "covered".    Actions:    - Talk to Masafumi about what happens when a UA      doesn't get the proper character encoding information.    Possible solutions:     - Add a checkpoint   - Add examples / explanation in a Note after checkpoint     (Guidelines 1, 5?)   - Add to definition of API   - Add to techniques   - In G5 prose, to "using standard communication channels for this     exchange", add information about using the appropriate character     encoding for these channels.    =============================================  4.12 Speech rate  =============================================    MD: Please do not specify the upper and lower bounds in       terms of English language!    MD: Plus, the concept of "word" is hard to define for, say,      Japanese. (It may be easier to talk about syllables...)    IJ Proposes:      - Make the range an example for English.     - Suggest that upper and lower bounds vary according        according to language.    =============================================  Checkpoint 2.7  =============================================    MD: It's unclear what the boundaries of   "recognized but unsupported" are:     1) Doesn't understand lang="fr"   2) Doesn't understand "fr" (or something like "qx", or      a string that isn't bound to a language code). The set      of language codes grows!   3) Understands "fr" but doesn't have a French dictionary      (for speech).      MD: If you know what "fr" means but don't have resources  to handle it (e.g., a dictionary), that's one thing (e.g.,  you can ask the user if using the italian dictionary you  do have is ok). If the user agent doesn't know how to  translate the code (e.g., "zh") to a language name that  most users will be familiar with (and most users will not  be familiar with language codes), then the UA won't help  a user decide whether the information (e.g., in Chinese)  is useful at all.    IJ: Note that in case where UA hands off rendering to  a speech synthesizer, then "recognize" could just mean   "pass it off to some appropriate sp. synthesizer".    MD: Another issue: if the purpose of 2.7 is to avoid confusion, then  there's little difference between perfectly rendered Chinese to  someone who doesn't understand Chinese, and garbage sounds or  glyphs. "It's all Greek to me."    IJ: While there may not be a difference, I'm more confident  saying that we are pretty sure that doing something one way  will cause confusion, but I can't guarantee that in another  case doing something right won't cause confusion.     MD: This actually points back to the charset issue again  (to ensure that you don't get garbage).    =============================================  "Natural language"  =============================================    MD: For text-to-speech and text-to-braille, it's important that you  know what language it is. For graphical rendering of text, the  language of the text is only of minor importance. What counts  in the latter case is the "script".    IJ: We've avoided the term "script" in this context to  avoid confusion with "scripting languages".     MD: So 2.7 needs adjusting because you want to talk about speech  (natural language) as well as graphical rendering (script).    MD: "case" (e.g., uppercase) is a special case. If you translate  to braille, you lose the distinction between katakana and  hiragana.     Action MD:    - Verify this with Max Nakane.    MD: For 7.5, I think that "script" is a more appropriate term.    Action:   - Ask Glen Adams what to use.    IJ: We could put two entries in for "script". But I need a  good definition of script.    MD: Check out Unicode.    =============================================  Configurations based on natural language  =============================================    MD: Should say that the user agent should allow  configuration for script/natural language. Suppose  you have a speech engine for fr and one for en.  The user will want to specify different speech  rates and thus needs sufficient configuration.    MD: For braille text, a user may want to have   shortened braille for English and long braille  for German.     MD: For graphical display, you can imagine that  people with visual disabilities will be more apt  at guessing English at smaller sizes..    MD: For Japanese, for example, many people can  figure out the text at 9-10 pixels. But this is  inadequate to represent the characters. Visually  impaired users can probably, with a language   they are familiar with, can put up with more fuzziness.    IJ: How do you prevent combinatorial explosions  of configurations (i.e., for every setting, N languages)?    MD: If the language information is provided in the source  document, and if you use CSS2, such configurations are easy  to do.    IJ: I would limit these requirements to text information.  For instance, I don't think it's important to be able  to say "I want the background to be blue when I'm viewing  a French document".    MD: The most important info:   - Text size   - Speech rate.   - [For braille, contracted or expanded style.]    =============================================  Language information and heuristics  =============================================    MD: In most documents, despite WCAG 1.0, language information is not  explicit.     IJ: This is a repair issue. Our document doesn't have many  repair requirements.    MD: You may hand off content to a speech synthesizer saying that it's  English, and the speech synthesizer may give it back and say "no, I  don't think this is English". This works for graphical rendering on a  script level, but doesn't work on a language level because the  graphical rendering doesn't have a dictionary. If the user knows  French and English and has a French and English speech synthesizer  installed. If the document says lang="fr", the UA will pick the French  speech synthesizer. Most documents will not say whether they are  French or English. One speech synthesizer will do a much better job of  rendering. It would be convenient (and probably not very difficult) to  switch sp. synthesizers automatically, without prompting the user.    IJ: I think that this is a convenience functionality: if the user can  select dictionaries manually, then they have access. So clearly not  impossible (thus not P1).    IJ formulating MD's requirement. Three cases:     - Author has specified natural language correctly.   - Author has specified natural language incorrectly.   - Author has not specified natural language.    In latter two cases, user must be able to select from  among available dictionaries (e.g., to override choices  by the author or user agent).    MD: In most cases, it's not necessary to specify natural  language information.     MD:   - Authors should identify the natural language of content.   - User agents must allow users to select natural language     (e.g., dictionary, different engine0.   - User agents may do automatic natural language selection      when authors haven't specified.    =============================================  4.2 Font family  =============================================    MD: Suppose you want to say "Use Helvetica". This is problematic for  multilingual documents. I think you have to be careful with the  wording.     MD: Both NN and IE do the right thing. You don't want 4.2  to mean "Choose Helvetica, and if Helvetica doesn't work give up."    MD: You should be able to say "Sans serif" and get something  reasonable.    MD: "the font family of *all* text". You need to qualify "all".  Not everything *has* to be in helvetica; only really what  the user expects to be in helvetica (e.g., English text).    Proposed:     - Clarify that the UA can choose another font family if     it can't find a way to represent a particular character.   - Clarify that the user must be able to select a preferred font     family but that some content in a given document may not be rendered     using that font family.    =============================================  7.5 Search  =============================================    MD: In English, you assume phonetic spelling. You assume  that people search by inputting the spelling. People who listen to  text-to-speech may not know the spelling. People who are used to  contracted braille may not know the extended version. People in Japan  might know the pronunciation of text, but not know which Kanji  to use. If you use the "plain text" based search interface, this might  not allow some people to find some information. I think this is very  much a disability issue.    MD: You might want to search on a transformed version.    IJ: Our limits are:   - Search for text characters in source   - Search only on those that have been rendered (or     will be, through a viewport)    MD: In Japanese, text is rendered graphically as Kanji.  Kanji can be read in different ways, and different ones the  same way. If someone knows shorthand braille, they want to search  using the shorthand.    IJ: Our checkopint doesn't talk about input methods - we  only talk about the search functionality. How the user gets  shorthand braille into the machine is not covered by 7.5.    IJ: I think the issue you raise is the same for other  input situations such as form controls. I also think that  this issue may be larger than for users with disabilities:  e.g. how Japanese users input Kanji.    =============================================  9.2 Input configuration  =============================================    MD: For Japanese and Chinese, input happens in two stages: the keys  you press, then there's the "IME" (input method editor). With some  user interaction, this combination produces the final text.     IJ: From 1.2:     "When available, developers should use APIs at a higher level of    abstraction than the standard device APIs for the operating system."    MD:      - Add a technique to 1.2 about higher level APIs (after IME)     for character input.    IJ: What about single-key bindings (checkpoint 9.5) in Japanese?    MD: Similar situation to form controls: some keys will not  be available since they have a particular function.    IJ: We cover different "modes" in 9.5.    MD: Alt-Shift may be used for switching input methods, for example.    IJ: That's covered by checkpoint 9.2    MD: There are arguments for deleting "accessibility"  (and leaving "conventions") in 9.2. For example, Alt-tab to switch  viewports is not clearly for accessibility, but should not be   interfered with.    =============================================  Conformance  =============================================    MD: "Must implement the standard API for the keyboard".  MD: There may be two APIs :   - Raw keys   - Final text after IME.    MD: We had DOM/I18N brainstorming on this issue.

Per our discussion with the DOM WG, the DOM 2 event  handler registration mechanism [1] doesn't allow programs  to list the available handlers.

      Hi Bryan,    1) The word "person" is not specific enough for our needs. We need    to distinguish users from authors from developers from readers from  ...    In the introduction, our wording can be humanized, but when we must    be clear about the class of people in question, I prefer to stick with    "User".    2) The word "must" is standard in W3C specifications. We use     use the term in accordance with RFC 2119 (which defines     for MUST, SHOULD, and MAY as used in like contexts). While     less provocative language may feel better, I would prefer     to use the standard language where possible.    As the document stabilizes, we (the editors) will have more  opportunities to massage the language of the document so that  it is both readable and a rigorous document. We will keep the  spirit of your comments in mind when we work on the introductory  and explanatory material.    Please keep the comments coming!     - Ian    Bryan Campbell wrote:    > I've been looking for general support for Accessibility & there's more  > excuses than I expected: See (& note GDrake's not my problem attitude)  > http://browserwatch.internet.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=threadlist&foru  > m=BrowserWatch+Chat&number=1&topic=000310-000000-120798-000011.msg&DaysPrune=80  > Which brings me to the wording of the Priorities it will likely all sound  > better by letting developers know they're ensuring all people can use the  > Web while not decreasing the Priorities' value to consumers.

I don't think so. I would apply the concept of "recognize" to  humans here: if you know that if affects accessibility, you document  it. If you don't, then you don't.     Of course, people can lie, but I don't think any document we write  can protect us against that.    I agree that this checkpoint is hard to verify (as many others  are in our document) and impossible to automate.     _ Ian       > Denis  >   > -----Original Message-----  > From: w3c-wai-ua-request@w3.org [mailto:w3c-wai-ua-request@w3.org]On  > Behalf Of Ian Jacobs  > Sent: Friday, April 13, 2001 8:21 PM  > To: w3c-wai-ua@w3.org  > Subject: [Editorial] Proposed clarification to checkpoint 12.5  > (documentation of changes that affect accessibility)  >   > Hello,  >   > In the 9 April draft [1], checkpoint 12.5 reads:  >   >    "12.5 In each software release, document all changes that  >          affect accessibility."  >   > I think this checkpoint is could be interpreted as making  > a requirement that spans more than one release of a user  > agent.

      Addition:    Issue 468 [1]: The "at least a majority" minimal requirement needs  review. Refer to Al's email [2]:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  On the other hand, the requirement of "at least a majority" of the  default key  bindings would seem to be infeasible in many situations.  The group  should  reconsider this language.  If the default key binding defines a full set  of  single-key plus two full layers of modified-key bindings, then there is  _no  way_ to reduce a majority of the actions defined [in the default key  binding]  to single-key bindings.  Never mind if there is a one-hand, large-key,  or  twelve-key device in use.  You just can't get there from here.  </BLOCKQUOTE>     - Ian    [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#468  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0399  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Issue 185 [1] involves clarification of the single stroke requirement  of checkpoint 10.4 of the 15 January 2000 Guidelines [2]:    <OLD>  10.4 Allow the user to change and control the input configuration.       Allow the user to configure the user agent so that some  functionalities       may be activated with a single command (e.g., single key, single  voice       command, etc.). [Priority 2]   </OLD>    In particular, the issue involves clarifiation of what "single key"  means. We discussed this issue at the 19 January teleconf [3].    PROPOSED    1) Change 10.4 to read:       <NEW 10.4>        Allow the user to change the input configuration.        [Priority 2]     </NEW>    2) Create a new checkpoint that reads:       <NEW>       Allow the user to configure the user agent so that frequently        used one-step operations may be activated directly        with a single input command (keystroke, voice command, etc.).           Note. User agents are not required to provide for single command                activation of all functionalites at the same time.                This checkpoint is an important special case of 10.4.     </NEW>       - This checkpoint says nothing about "how many", and the       techniques document will say that user agents        - Techniques: Refer to Bryan Campbell emails on the list.                   Also, think about macro capabilities.                   Also, think about modes of operation (e.g., editing                   mode in which text keys are used for text, not UI  control)    3) Delete the term "control" from the document and use "configure"     instead. The current definitions are very close. To control means     "that the user can choose preferred behavior from a set of      options." This sounds like configure to me! Configure talks about     ways to configure as well (profiles, UI, etc.)     - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#185   [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG-20000115/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0124.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The conformance claim should indicate the scope of the claim,  in this case a combination of two pages.

My opinion is that, since alternative pages should be used as little  as possible, you should avoid where possible creating an   alternative site. However, it would make sense that if you have a   particular type of page that appears frequently and is always   inaccessible alone, you could/should promote easy navigation within that   set of pages.     > C: Regarding Compliance Scope.  >   > The guidelines state:  >   > Form 2: Include, on each page claiming conformance, one of three icons  > provided by W3C and link the icon to the appropriate W3C explanation of the  > claim.

Please note that the conformance statements in ATAG and UAAG are more  general and we're slowly improving conformance provisions since WCAG 1.0  was published. Check out, for instance, the UAAG Proposed Rec  conformance  section:         http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/#Conformance    There's still work to be done to show how to use metadata to  describe scope, etc.     > Questions:  >   > 1.

      Hi Folks,    I'm using Amaya 4.1 (23 Nov 2000) on Linux.    When I use amaya on the command line, "amaya foo.html"  opens the existing file foo.html just fine.     When I type "amaya bar.html" and bar.html doesn't exist,  I would like amaya to create it in the current directory  (or at least prepare to create it in the current directory).    Instead, amaya prompts me for a different file name  in a different directory: /New.html    If I type "amaya foo.htm bar.htm" I'm not prompted at all.

      Hello,    I very much like the idea of creating a more abstract WCAG 2.0.  Please consider my comments below. Part 1 requests a change.  Part 2 requests an addition (in WCAG 2.0 or in a central document).  Part 3 plays with the principles themselves.    Part 1) I don't think it's a good idea to redefine the terms      Guidelines and Checkpoints. I think doing so will create confusion     and I don't understand why it's necessary.     a) The checkpoint is the fundamental unit of action and conformance.     b) Everything else is either organization (Guidelines) or  implementation        detail (Technique).      c) Principles are nice, and they can help convey a model, but I don't        think that they are any more than further organization.      d) Please don't shift terms! (A means what B used to mean and B means        what C used to mean). If you want more granularity, please just        create checkpoints consisting of more than one statement: "You  must        do A and B and C but aren't required to do D."     e) I believe that we have in the past (in both WCAG and ATAG)  considered        two levels of conformance: "you must do this to meet the  checkpoint and        by meeting all the checkpoints, you satisfy the Guideline." We  dropped        this because it confused readers. And I don't think it's  necessary.        If a Guideline is purely organizational, then you don't have to         satisfy it. You only have to satisfy the checkpoints (which are        prioritized).    Part 2) I think it's important to convey the following (either in WCAG  2.0 or     in a document central to all the guidelines):       a) The WAI accessibility model assigns responsibilities to different        parties for ensuring accessibility: authors, user agent  developers,         and users.          For instance, it is the responsibility of the author to provide        alternative content, the responsibility of user agent developers  to ensure        that it is synchronized and to allow control over style, and it is  the        responsibility of the user to procure assistive technology. One  may        also consider two other entities in assigning responsibilities:        authoring tool developers and specification writers. Thus, it is  the        responsibility of the spec writer to ensure that a specification  includes        accessibility features, separates structure from style, etc.       b) The requirements of the WAI Guidelines are determined by the  Working        Group based on (in no particular order):          1) User needs        2) Technology readily available to users and authors, including           authoring software, assistive technologies, operating systems,           and specifications. Cost and feasibility do factor into            the requirements, though more weight is given to user  requirements           in general. Making some assumptions more explicit will make the           document easier to write and easier to communicate to readers.             For example, consider why text is so important:              + Today, speech synthesis technology is readily available and              fairly reliable.              + Most mainstream user agents do not include speech synthesis              technology              + Optical character recognition and audio-to-speech              transcription technology is either not reliable enough or  too              resource intensive or too expensive.              + Text is easy for authors to create           Therefore, since today it is easy for authors to create text          documents that today's readily available technologies can         render to eyes, ears, and fingertips, it is a requirement to         provide text equivalents to non-text content. (Refer to comments         from Eric Hansen on this topic [2]).    Part 3) Organizing principles. While I'm at it, here's how I might         break down the requirements (without indicating here which          responsibilities are for authors, user agent developers, and         users.           WARNING: The following organization and commentary has been         jotted down capriciously and is subject to emphatic retraction         by the author. Comments are welcome!       a) Requirements related to perception and the senses: content        and user interface must be usable through sight, hearing, and        touch. [Again, note that this makes technological assumptions.         Perhaps interaction through brainwaves directly will some day        be possible. But it's not today.] This principle includes        all requirements related to the senses: colors, renderings,         control of style due to sensory needs, etc. I think it would also        include requirements related to space (e.g., don't require the        user to move through space to activate a functionality, the  requirement        that content be available in serial form) and time        (e.g., maintain synchronization on the one hand, and allow the        user to control time scales on the other). It also involves        communication through APIs between user agents since the assitive        technologies are generally there to compensate for sensory  limitations.       b) Requirements related to meaning: ensure that the user can  understand        the author's intended meaning. This principle inclues all         requirements related to markup (separation of style and  structure),        to validity of markup, consistency, writing style, simplicity,         use of graphics, overviews, summaries, use of metadata, etc.       c) Requirements related to usability: This principle includes  requirements        for navigation, control of sudden changes to content,  documentation,        configuration, control, repair strategies, implementation of  standards,        following system conventions, consistency in the user interface,         user control of changes to the user interface, etc.       Of course, some requirements don't fall perfectly under a particular     principle, others may fall into more than one. Some reasons for this     choice of groupings:       1) I suspect that sensory requirements can be generalized to         device requirements. I can't prove this. <grin>       2) I think it's useful to separate meaning and sense, just as it's        useful to separate structure and style. Structure is close to        meaning and style is all about rendering (to the senses). It's        useful when designing content (I think) to consider meaning        before rendering issues, even if the two worlds collide almost        immediately (and in the authoring process they are frequently        performed close together if not at the same time.        For instance, it's useful to provide graphics because        they can convey meaning more effectively than text in many cases.        But because they're graphics, they raise some other accessibility        issues and text equivalents are necessary.       3) Reviewers of the UA Guidelines requested that "content"  requirements        and "UI" requirements be clearly identified as such. I think that        identifying requirements related to using the content, and not        just reading it, may be useful. Obviously, navigation bars are  part        of content, but some of them differ little from UA "back buttons".        The usability of a page, site, or piece of software feels  different        to me than understanding the author's meaning.         - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20000726.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0184.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      22 June 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Ian Jacobs (Chair/Scribe)   Harvey Bingham   Kitch Barnicle   Eric Hansen   Dick Brown   Gregory Rosmaita   Tim Lacy    Charles McCathieNevile   Mickey Quenzer   David Poehlman    Regrets:     Jon Gunderson   Mark Novak   Jim Allan    Next meeting: 29 June.    Regrets: Eric (probably for next month), Jon, Kitch      Agenda [1]  [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0505.html    0) Review of action items:      TL: I talked to Rob Rylea about independent volume        control of audio sources. He said, that depends on        what software is configured to be the default player.        For IE, windows media player typically used.      IJ: Could windows media player be used for each source of        sound?      TL: You can choose the player independently of the default.        I don't know what happens when you have several media        players going at once.       (New) Action GR: Pursue speech synth ranges for other           properties than speech rate.    2) PR#287: Proposed clarification to checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, 3.6     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#287       In particular, this proposal:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0496.html        Refer also to HB's proposed modification:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0504.html       GR: I think we want to separate content that is blinking/marquee.         Red flag: is this on a piece-by-piece basis or globally.       HB: Is it consistent with marquee that it always moves in a         reading direction?       GR: Not sure for non-standard markup.       TL: The MARQUEE element supports directionality.       IJ: I think the issue was movement, do we need the fine         control?       EH: But if you freeze everything, it would make it hard         to interact with the page. Presumably, a global control         would freeze all video in the document.       KB: Is restart the same as removing pause?       EH: "resume"?       Consensus on "resume".       HB: In SMIL, you can jump to anchors in video.       IJ: One proposal is to treat video and audio         individually,  but animations and blinking          globally. But of course, you could treat         synchronized components as a unit.       EH: Isn't the focus generally on one particular         video, rather than multiple video?       KB: We've talked about a video track of sign         language.       EH: But presumably they would be linked so that         they could be controlled in sync.       KB: Yes, in that situation. But you could imagine         three sports matches on the screen at the         same time.        EH: It's common to find several animated graphics         operating independently on the screen.       IJ: Maybe we can make a distinction based on         "importance". Video seems to be more         important in general.        EH: One way to distinguish animations and         video (without considering importance)        is to say "start, stop, pause, and resume        multimedia presentations and audio         presentations". I'm not sure whether         blinking content should be considered separately.              That way, in the future if the dividing line        between animations and video blurs, we're         covered. This may be a case where global        and independent control are useful.       IJ: Like global and independent volume control.       TL: (Back on the multimedia question):         I have three players operating indendently on          separate feeds, and I can control them         separately. If you had a Web page with 2-3         embedded AVIs, and they were set to play         on load and to use a plug-in, it should work.               IJ: That's great, except that some sources may         be not handled by the UA (but other software).       TL: Also, they can run asychronously. Suppose you         had 2 AVIs using HTML+Time to display dynamically         changing captions. What would happen: as each         caption changes independent of each other, it would         get a focus event, meaning that the screen reader         would jump between them.       GR: When HPR first came out, this was a problem - two          instance of screen readers.        GR: With pure audio, UI is spoken by screen reader and         AVIs are left alone.       DP: How do you read the text in a SMIL presentation.       MQ: It depends on the browser. WebSpeak has problems with         this (you can't have an audio stream going and browse         at the same time). With Jaws and IE5, the access program         is monitoring the UI that got spawned by the presentation.         The browser would still be active, but if it didn't have         focus, you wouldn't know what was going on.        GR: Also UI issues - when I was listening to LPPlayer with         Jaws.        IJ: How usable is the interface where there are three         media players going at once?        TL: About the same as a picture in a picture on a TV.         There could be some utility to this.       TL: What about, if you have 3 streams, you need to be         able to turn two off?       IJ: That sounds like it's not good enough: you may need         to hear all of them at once, at different levels.        IJ: I think that default level should be global, and         that control is available individually (on a          page-by-page basis).       IJ: Any objections to the proposal:          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0434.html           1) Allow the user to configure the global audio volume            (including silent).             Note: Do this at the OS level or the assistive technology                  level.           2) Allow the user to control the volume of audio sources            independently.           Delete 3.2, 3.4       CMN: How far to you have to be able to turn up the volume          before it becomes a hardware problem?       IJ: I would say that applicability kicks in at that point.        Consensus: Adopt this proposal.     Action IJ: Incorporate in the next draft.       EH: For the other proposal:         a) Handle multimedia presentation, audio presentation (audio          only) and stand-alone visual track.         b) For all of those, advance, rewind, start, stop, pause, and          resume.         c) For blinking content, one idea was to be able to override          the blinking (perhaps toggling between on and off state).          IJ: Is this pause and resume?          EH: If it's pause, is the content off or on?          IJ: For me, the minimal requirement is stop and have              apparent content. The ability to restart is not              as apparent.          GR: Are we talking about just text?          IJ: No, I think content in general.          EH: Is blinking content either a standalone visual track?              If so, it falls under category "b". If we're talking              about a specific case for HTML, we could limit ourselves              to the blinking text case.       /* Mickey drops off */            EH: Maybe, if we have fine-level control for the              items in group "a", maybe we can concentrate on              blinking text only.             IJ: Your proposal drops the blinking image case.                        GR: How do UAs know when something is animated?            CMN: The image contains some control code.  Rollovers               are done with javascript. Browsers allow you               to stop gif animations. There's no technical               barrier to having that as a default behavior.             IJ: The requirement to step-through animation is              P1 for access to all content.          Proposal:          1)  Advance, rewind, start, stop, pause, and resume              multimedia presentation, audio presentation (audio              only) and stand-alone visual track.            2) Freeze blinking text and render statically.            GR: What about scrolling text?            IJ: Is that an animation?            EH: There are cases where an animation looks exactly              like text. Do blinking or scrolling text constitute              animations?            HB: Captioning would be another example.            IJ: Yes, how do captions fit into this?            EH: Maybe we don't need a special checkpoint for text.              Maybe mention this in a note: include this              as a "stand-alone" visual track.            GR: I think there's a distinction between visual              track and text, because you could want all text              at once.                EH: Then we would exclude moving text from #1              and indicate that it's covered in #2.            Refer to Eric's background on multimedia:           http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0503.html            Action IJ: Propose multimedia definitions to the list          to define borders of these proposed checkpoints.             EH: One question: Should a standalone visual track be          considered a special case of a multimedia presentation?            EH: One idea: allow the user to configure the UA for              consent before playing an auditory track.            IJ: Why is this different from blinking or moving content?              I could see this being done globally, but I wouldn't want              to have to confirm the playing of each source.                    CMN: (On the question of what the viewport is for sound):              Does real stereo mean different viewports? I think the              idea of one speaker is insufficient.             EH: We have tracks, channels, viewports, and speakers.           CMN: We address issues like positioning of multiple viewports              and synchronization of viewports. When you have multiple              channels at once, you need to be able to configure how              you receive those channels.            EH: Do we have checkpoints that cover GR's requirements              already? One requirement would be "Be able to configure              the UA to prompt before opening an additional viewport."              Wouldn't this cover the case of launching an application              that plays audio? Or maybe we go back to what I suggested              earlier: promt the user before playing a new audio  presentation              or standalone audio. You could have a similar checkpoint              for video as well. Should this be a universal requirement:              before you start a presentation, you should be able              to configure the UA to prompt before opening.            IJ: I don't want to be prompted for each loaded image.            GR: I continue to return to the analogy of inadvertent              submission of forms.            IJ: I agree that the "on/off" requirements haven't been              clear about whether this means globally or on              a source-by-source basis.            EH: What about 4.15: control of focus changes: Would this              cover loading of audio?            Action GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and          see whether they can be clarified to account for control          of rendering of audio (and possibly other content) on load.            EH: We're focusing on audio on-load. What about prompting          for individual graphics or animations?             DP: I'm not sure what the accessibility issue would be               for other content types. I can imagine cases where              we might want to load background images and sometimes              we might not.            GR: Turning images on or off is a conscious decision not              to load images. I don't think you should be prompted              on an image-by-image basis. I'm more concerned about              those things that are not static.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

IJ: This is style, so probably not pertinent.   GR: Are behaviors still being discussed?   IJ: I think there are new proposals in the works.   IJ: I expect to talk to the WG on Tuesday morning. Others       are welcome to join me.    DOM: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0213     RS: I put in my requirements for DOM 3 to the PF WG.     - Add style sheets (not necessarily on the client side).     - Need an API to the computed value of a property (without       implementing the cascade).       IJ: Not sure this would work in some @media cases       (since the browser may not do speech, for example).     IJ: Additional idea from Aaron Leventhal: add a DOM module   to account for what MSAA does and the DOM does not.     RS: We talked about this PF. We were trying to extend the DOM up to   the application layer.  You put an overlay over the DOM to get DOM   + application specific information. It's a lot of work to get this   happen (e.g., a subgroup of the DOM WG). One thing that the JAVA   accessibility API does (and we're looking for in MSAA), is to   create an indexable character interface to documents (something   like an offscreen model interface).    ------  Issues  ------    1. Definition Issues:       1. Issue 359: Definition: text content (incompatible with WCAG?)       2. Issue 358: Definition: Equivalent       3. Issue 322: The definition of the word element       4. Issue 321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of  checkpoint 2.3       5. Issue 394: Checkpoint 2.1: Vague about what cannot be  provided through a source view   Proposal:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0249       IJ Reviews proposal:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0249     HB: Why "optional" and not "alternative"?   IJ: Optional content is a larger class (including titles,       alternatives, etc.)     JG: My concern is that checkpoint c is P2 in this proposal.       Why P2 here?     IJ: Strictly speaking, checkpoints a and b are P1 and        provide sufficient access. Checkpoint c did not qualify       for P1 strictly speaking.     EH: When we were considering the priority of 2.3, in my mind,       it was P1 because the old 2.1 was broken. The source       view was not a P1 requirement at that time. In this proposal,       I think the need for P1 is lessened.     IJ: Another piece of the reasoning behind why (c) is P2:       "content meant for users" is not always clear, and therefore       it was difficult to push this as a P1 checkpoint when this       intention is not clearly discernable in the format.     GR: "Required optional content" is a little weird.     IJ: Good point!      Action IJ: Find clearer wording.     GR: I propose changing "optional content" to "conditional content".       I think that conditional doesn't presume that one form of       content is preferred over another.     IJ: I don't think "optional" suggests that optional content       is lower class.     JG: Does the proposal overall seem to capture what the WG       was trying to capture with the original 2.1 and 2.3?     GR: I think that this proposal improves the document.   DP: Me too.   TL: Me too.   JA: Me too.   MQ: Me too. But unsure about the definition of "optional content".      Action IJ: Put back rationale about why user control of optional   content is required (to allow users to find useful equivalents).     JG: Who wants checkpoint (c) to be a P1 checkpoint? Since few people   will be able to use a source view to get at optional content, I think   it should be P1.     P1: MQ (I don't like to have to depend on the user's access to            source code), GR, JG (I don't think most users will be           able to do this).   P2: JA, DP (I don't think we'll gain anything by raising to P1),       RS, TL, HB (You have access to the source view, the fallback).     IJ: I don't feel strongly about limiting (c) to P2. I know there       are arguments on both sides.   EH: I feel similarly. This may not be strictly P1, but it makes       it hard on the user. But if you abuse "P1" a lot, it ruins       credibility. So I think P2, but I don't feel strongly about it;       I probably wouldn't object to P1.     JG: I think that making (c) a P2 would be a big change to the       document. E.g., low-vision users having to access "alt"        through a source view.     GR: How will someone with a severe cognitive disability use a source       view to access unrendered optional content?     IJ: Note that (a) gives "alt" text when images are turned off       (in the case of HTML). Don't bind 3.7 to Guideline 2 since       3.7 is not specific to HTML.     EH: I think that (c) is a repair function, in the sense that either       the original spec wasn't adequate or because the user agent       can't understand that specification.     Resolved:    - Accept the proposal with (c) as a P1.    - Add an issue to the issues list about the priority of (c)      (to lower to P2).    2. Issue 430: What classes of animations are covered by our                  G4 animation requirements?     http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#430    IJ: Status of question of what classes of animations should      be covered by our requirements to control animations.       Refer to question on the list:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0250    3. Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device independent access to pointer     (mouse) specific events.     IJ Proposal:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0243     JG Additional Proposal:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0248     JA: I agree with IJ's comments on this as a repair issue.       I think that checkpoint (c) should be P3. You can emulate       all kinds of things and you're not guaranteed of a result.       And from what I've heard from Rich and others, I think this       would be hard to implement.     /* JA leaves the call */     GR: I think that the ultimate call needs to rest with the user, not       the user agent; the user should be able to turn off the        emulation feature or use it.     JG: Everyone I've asked about this repair says "P1 since this is       prevalent on the Web - authors are doing the wrong thing."       What is it reasonable for the UA to do that would potentially       benefit the average keyboard user? So I proposed a fourth       checkpoint.       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0248          Checkpoint D: Provide keyboard activation of the following       pointer based scripting events for elements with explicit event       handlers: onClick, onDblClick, onMouseOver, onMouseOut, onMouseUp       and onMouseDown [Priority 1].     IJ: This is specific to the DOM and HTML.     JG: I'd rather have the necesssary repair be as narrow as possible.       People tell me that this is a major problem and the UA needs       to do something.     IJ: Is this repair really useful for users?     GR: That's up to the user to decide.     IJ: Why does mousekeys not suffice?     GR: You need snap-to-focus functionality.     JG: Moving the mouse automatically breaks GUI design rules.       But unless you can get to the focus with mouse keys,       I don't think it would meet the requirement.     IJ: Note the different levels of requirements:      a) Manual emulation (fishing around)      b) Automatic emulation (trigger onmouseover when onfocus occurs).     No resolution.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

If the source view shows only the document source, that means it won't  show the result of the application of style sheets, transformations,   user agent preferences, and scripts. This means the source view will  show what came "over the wire" before any local processing. I'm ok with  that if that's how we define it. Is that how source views work in  practice?     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

My new statement  > says "If an operating system or user agent does not offer or support a  > keyboard API, then the user agent cannot conform to these guidelines."     The "standard" API doesn't come from the UA, only the OS. Therefore, if  the OS doesn't have one, I still think the UA should be able to conform  by providing at least one API for the keyboard. This means that ATs will   be able to communicate, just not through a "standard" API (since there  isn't one).     _ Ian      >It could be their own keyboard API through an infrared link to a Kiosk, but  > they still must offer the keyboard API.  >   > Jon  >   > At 06:32 AM 10/7/2000 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Jon Gunderson wrote:  > > >  > > > Since the group has required support for a keyboard API, I don't think the  > > > we should allow any type of conformance if a user agent cannot support a  > > > keyboard API.

Yes, I agree:    1) Anyone can make a claim.  2) Each claim must identify product or plug-in version. Each claim     should provide information about where to get those components.  3) User agent developers should make available user agents whose  features     allow conformance with little or no extra effort from the user beyond     standard installation.    To bolster point three, we could define a profile that people could  name in a conformance claim. For instance, suppose that one conformance  profile is "Level Double-A Default Installation" which means that  if you install the software following the default settings, you will  get a Double-A conforming UA. There may be other profiles that interest  people (e.g., Level-A when used with this speech synthesizer) but  I would not propose trying to standardize too many. If people are  most interested in knowing whether the UA will conform out of the box,  would we make it easier on people to provide them with a known profile?        > The authoring tools working group has already adopted this approach in  > their conformance statement for the authoring tools guidelines, so we would  > be consistent with they specifications for conformance.

         WAI UA WG Face to Face  Cambridge, MA  11 December 1998    Chair: Jon Gunderson (JG)  Scribe: Ian Jacobs (IJ)    Participants:  Olivier Borius (OB)  David Clark (DC)  Chuck Hitchcock (CH)  Jutta Treviranus (JT)  Kathy Hewitt (KH)  Daniel Dardailler (DD)  Glen Gordon (GG)  Bill Kilroy (BK)  Wilson Craig (WC)  Marja (MK)  Charles (CMN)  Denis Anson (DA)  Tom Wlodkowski (TL)  Chuck Oppermann (CO)  Harvey Bingham (HB)  Wendy Chisholm (WAC)  Markku Hakkinen (MH)  Judy Brewer (JB)    Agenda: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-f2f-information    WC: Where are companies like Henter-Joyce being represented  in the guidelines?     JG: Early on, the concept of independent vs. dependent user  agents. What should each type support.    DD: Prefer the distinction between "mainstream" and  "specialized". We should put most of our efforts into  ensuring the accessibility of mainstream browsers.  Specialized user agents already know what to do  (it's their bread and butter).    WC: There are inherent conflicts in defining both  assistive tech vendors and mainstream browsers as  user agents.     DA: Does it make sense to say that the user agent  does the rendering and to say that the assistive  technology controls the user agent.    DC: Not always about providing the information,  but about providing the hooks so that assistive  techs can provide the information.    DA: Things that provide access to the rendered  information are assistive technologies.     JT: Talking about rendering muddies the waters.  I prefer dependent/independent definitions.    IJ: Editors introduced distinction, but haven't  developed it sufficiently.    WC: Fix 1.1 (where terms used inconsistently).    DD: To me, Jaws or Webspeak are independent because they  have a knowledge of the markup. It's an implementation  detail that they don't parse themselves.    JT: I don't think the analogy is quite correct.     CMN: We all know what we mean, and we want to use  the concept in the guidelines, but don't have a neatly  worded definition yet.     CO: I like Glen's characterization the best. Assistive  technology sits on UA and provides access to it. How  it does it is irrelevant. Doesn't include PWWebspeak  because they can take care of themselves. Any screen  reader has to rely on underlying technology that  the user may or may not have. PWWebspeak provides  that technology (though it uses the IE renderer). But  PWWebspeak is a self-contained application.     DD: There are two axes: mainstream vs. specialized  and dependent/independent.    JG: How can an agency claim conformance to these  guidelines? Perhaps specialized browsers would claim  conformance in a different way than mainstream  browsers.    CO: This group not formed because we had a lot  of complaints about PWWebspeak.    DC: So what is our audience. What are they comfortable  with and what do they need?    DD: I agree with both Jon and Chuck. Why don't we  say up front that our primary audience is mainstream  browsers. Apply, of course, also to specialized  user agents.    JT: Guidelines may also be a blueprint for how  all types of user agents will communicate (interface).  Therefore important to define who's who and what  communication takes place.    DA: Significant different between mainstream browsers  and specialized. The guidelines should help UAs  be as mainstream as possible.     CMN: Worries me to think that some browsers can be  used by everybody and some cannot.    JG: Need to identify classes of UAs so that we can  define requirements and responsibilities. Need to  formulate appropriate strategies and educate  companies.    /* Conformance */    IJ: Proposes a conformance in which     1) Conformance to three sets (Pri 1/2/3)    DA: I like the proposal that Ian doesn't like.    1) Conformance to all Pri 1 first.    CO: Compliance important    1) Techniques for developers    2) Comply to guidelines    Possibly conflicting goals.    Concept of priority (if it were up to me). Either    "required" or "recommended" (two priorities rather    than three). You either do it or    you don't. Give people notice by making a recommendation    first, then a requirement later.    I also advocate a series of WAI documents (say, every    18 months).    KH: Define conformance in terms of Priority one items.    They need to be relevant to industry. The document    became unuseful. (Lots of priority ones, wasn't    sure why so many Pri 1). Would think that the guidelines    would be more of a bell curve: small set Pri 1, lots    of Pri 2, fewer Pri 3. Need to be more careful about    what we label Pri 1.    <span class="action">Action KH:</span> Send comments to list.</span>    CMN: One problem with the recommendation-to-required    track is that this document is meant to address    problems now. Document should say "You must do this."    Whether now or later, it still must be done. It's     important now.    DD: Not just an issue of priorities. A lot list of    Pri 1 may mean that the granularity has to change.      I agree with CMN in theory. But there is also the    market and the implementation has to be part of the    loop. Guidelines can't be wildest dreams.    CO: We need techniques to be as specific as possible    (lots of techniques ok, useful to developers).    Want to be told which attributes of HTML need to    be supported. Not just support HTML 4.0.      (to CMN:) Technology changes. What may be a problem    now may not be a problem in the future. "Don't use    tables" may be true now, but in the future, may    not be a problem.    IJ: Discussion of distinction between techniques     in guidelines document vs. elaboration of     techniques in techniques document. Conformance     with respect to normative list of techniques     as expressed in the guidelines document.    DC: Back to question of dependent/independent. Must     describe Pri 1 techniques in terms of "alone" or     "in conjunction with" other technologies.    CO: Apply priorities to problems, not solutions.    That does not discount the fact that there are    better ways than others to accomplish certain    things.    DC: Want to avoid reverse engineering to get    the job done. Don't want to force impractical    solutions.    DA: Hook must be provided, but hook must also    be used.    JG: W3C must educate so that developers are aware    of these hooks.    WAC: Back to conformance...Have these discussions    happened in other groups.    KH: (referring to DA's comment): Native vs.   Assistive support. If we provide hooks, we've done  our jobs.    GG: Mainstream browsers may not do the right thing  for users. Not through fault of their own. Right  thing may not be clear.     DD: Some people may not have opportunity to  get the technology.    IJ: Economics, bandwidth, platform, ...    CO: Cross-disability benefits of assistive  technologies. E.g., multiple table renderings could benefit  a wider audience.    JG: Summarizing   1) Who's the audience for the document? Industry developers      but also consumer groups (purchasing products that      conform to guidelines).      2) Pri 1's are most important for conformance.      <span class="resolved">Resolved</span>:       Compliance/Conformance will be to      Priority 1 techniques as expressed in the guidelines      document. There is further work to establish      what class of user agent must conform to which      of those techniques.        Add note: Guidelines are the goals. May be other      ways to meet them, but these are the techniques      chosen by this WG. In other words, you don't      conform to "Accessibility", you conform to the      document.        <span class="action">Action editors:</span> Draft exact      wording of this conformance statement.        Microsoft agrees with reservations and waits to review      pending proposal.        JT (Chair of AU WG): Sounds good.      WAC (Editor of PAGL): Sounds good.         DC: Writing a spec and defining the bar       for passing the spec are distinct.        CO (to Denis): Difficult to say "We comply with      a technique" since we may not agree with it or      think we can do it better. (Comparison iwth      Windows Logo guidelines). How do we identify      the problems and fix them?        JT: Is the word "technique" appropriate? Perhaps      too strongly implies "how". Would "demonstrable      outcome" be better?       3) We need to ensure that industry concerns        remain in the loop of decision-making.    DC: You can't design for all people. Trying to    accomplish something for one group may    contradict with the needs of another.    --  Document:  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981112  --    Accessible design principles and practices.    Technique 3.1.1:     CMN: Change wording to "available through control  mechanisms that are not device-dependent."    DA: What if they use third-party assistive techs?  Does this count.    IJ: Recognizes that "all functionalities" is big.    KH: Please underline that access to a button  not important, but the functionality offered  by the UA is available.    CO: 3.1 Collapse all three.    IJ: 3.1.3 important on its own    IJ: "general principles of design" is vague.    CO: So is "is accessible".    DC: 3.1.2 raises an issue mentioned at the last  face-to-face. I'd like to see more about mnemonic  or simplistic or logical aids. These techniques  are oriented toward visual disabilities and we  must also consider cognitive as well. I also   think it contradicts 3.1.1    WAC: What worries me about 3.1.1 is that the functionalities  must be <strong>readily available</strong>, not just  available. Customization is important and I should  be able to customize for all functionalities.    DA: Must be functionally accessible as well as    just accessible.    KH: I agree in theory with the comment about "readily    available" (you don't want to have to go through    5 submenus).     IJ: Users must be able to customize their environment.      Also must have access to all functionality. Together,      you get what you want.    DA: 3.1.3. Installation procedure must have equivalent     accessibility as the application.     CMN: The installation procedure is part of the UA  and therefore are subject to the guidelines.    IJ: Is 3.1.2 useful?    DC: Strike it. Covered in 3.1.1    WAC: Part of 3.1.2 is:     1) Use standard platform toolkits (so that         screen readers pick up).     2) Accessibility API.    CO: Why should standard platform toolkit be used?       DD: Use platform toolkits (which may be made   accessible) for consistency.    WAC (modifying): Whatever tool you use, when you paint text,  it should be painted as text, not an image.    JT: Point Wendy making is that there are a lot of   things not covered in 3.1.2 (including her point   above). Standards will improve accessibility.    CO: Re "how text is drawn". Lowest level: pixels     drawn. Higher level - glyph (still an image).      Higher level -index to glyph. Higher level -      Unicode reference. Always an image. Applications     are starting to paint their own image, bypassing     OS hooks. Difficult to define "how text is drawn".     It's a moving target.        This is a very difficult problem: making a user     interface and one that's accessible. Not the goal     of this group (making content accessible). There     are plenty of good references about how to make     an interface accessible.       Don't ignore the issue, just don't want to spent     a lot of time on this issue. Use platform guidelines.     Let's worry about HTML-specific issues.    CMN: Technique 3.1.2 circular with guideline.    WAC: The principles exist out there and we need    to point to them obviously.    IJ: Careful - AU Guidelines will be referring to   this document and how to make UA interface accessible.    WAC: We also refer to UAs in the PAGL.    /* Break */          3.4 Provide documentation about accessibility features.    Ian: Comment about "is accessible" again. What does  "is accessbile".    WAC: Should this be in a central reference document?    JB: Two things we're planning:    1) Need for common definitions for all three documents   2) Need for assistive technology document. (Publish      as a W3C NOTE)    DC: In this particular instance, "alternative formats"      would be more appropriate than "is accessible".    CMN: I don't agree.    DD: For 3.4 (1, 2, 3). Clarify online "product"    documentation.    DA: For many products, the HOWTO install must be   accessible before the software itself is installed.    IJ: "is accessible" used rather than refer to  specific formats or renderings.    GG: Comments refer to application as well as   installation. Define as one unit up front.    CO: This is not an HTML issue, but a general   application issue.        HB: Is there a convention that we could live  with (e.g., a README file). Appropriate for  UAs to depend on a simple text format.    IJ: Both documentation and installation are  important entry points and should be in the document.    JB: People frustrated that features not more  readily available, even if they exist in  a tool. People not very good at finding that  information.    CW: Jaws installation - if all you have to do     to install is put your CD in and hit enter,     a braille one-liner.     JG: Is there consensus that the techniques in 3.4  cover the issue adequately.     HB: Time element. Installation is a one-time event.  Day to day use and accessibility in those scenarios  a very different thing.    TW: 3.4.4 is a priority 2. I have concerns about  that based on the education project we're working  with. Teachers deal with a lot of users, some  more savvy than others. This should be a priority 1.    DA: Look at the definitions of Pri 1 vs. Pri 2. If  someone shows you the features (even though you  don't read the documentation), you can still use  the features. Therefore should be a Pri 2.    TW: Problem with educators is that they don't know  about these features. And their students don't.  Too many people don't know someone who can  show them the features.    KH: I agree with Denis. Shouldn't the education role    be carried out by the EO WG? Difficult to go    into a class of functionalities and ask what meets    an accessibility concern. There may be things users    use to meet their needs that we might not think    of immediately as "accessibility features".    Marja: Following reasoning of "someone else could do  it", all the techniques could be Priority 2.   Very useful to provide scenarios (e.g., for blind  users). Show how features used in combination.    DD: How do we define accessibility feature. Is it  a view of the documentation or a separate part of  the document.    CMN: To follow up on DD - If your documentation is  incomplete, the tool is inaccessible. If complete,  but poor quality, doesn't mean inaccessible (just  poor). Telling people how to organize their  documentation is a hairy issue. Should be Priority 2.    MH: There needs to be some general scenarios about  how the tool can be used (whether or not you  have a disability). This would be very helpful.    IJ: Suggest integrating accessibility comments throughout    documentation, but this would be a recommendation.    Realistically, need to provide a separate section that    gives a few of the most important entry points.    DC: We shouldn't make the decision about integration  or separation. Just to make the information readily  available. For 3.4.4 - don't talk about "a section,"  just readily available.    JB: HTML 4.0 different than a UA. Helpful in HTML 4.0  to sprinkle references. For a UA, however, very  useful to have a separate section. Readily available  is most important.    DA: Recall definition of Priority 1. Documentation  is a "difficult" issue, not impossible.    Section 3.5    How to let people know there are keyboard commands  available?    CO: How is 3.5.1 different from 3.4.4?    JG: Former is specific instance of latter.    IJ: Highlight keyboard access since so important.    DA: Providing shortcuts in a menu may not be  so useful if you can't get to menu.    IJ: Use OS standard mechanisms.    Section 6.2    Use and provide accessible interfaces to  other technologies.    CMN: Techniques that begin "Otherwise" feel  like they should be collapsed.    IJ: Propose collapsing 6.2.2, 3, 4.    CO: 6.2.1 same as 6.2.5 (or could be made).  CO: 6.2.4 Pet peeve. Define "standard". Propose    revise "use operating system-provided interfaces".    DD: Bugs in 6.2.3 wording.    /* Ian: move 6.2.2 to top of list */    Section 3.2    CMN: 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are potentially in conflict.  What if conventions are inaccessible. Propose  mergining into one sensisble technique.    DC: (from on high of soap box): Don't forget  cognitive issues.     JG: "mouse-only" to "device-independent".    IJ: "Wheverever possible". Fuzzy. Remove where   possible, or enumerate.    DC: Command-line only interface would probably  be inaccessible in the broader scheme.    CO: 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 covered in 3.1.     CO: 3.2.3. Microsoft has strong              disagreement with priority of that.    CO: 3.2.4. Good idea. Add comment - use the  platform-provided mechanism if available.    JB: Don't think 3.2.3 should be Priority 1.    CO: 3.2.5    We have a "restore defaults" button. This doesn't   allow you to switch back and forth. Your settings   are gone. Not too many applications let you do this.    CMN: Push 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 covered by 3.1. 3.2.3 could   be broadened to allow users to configure control   of the browser (Pri 1). More general than keyboard   access. 3.2.5 is a Pri 3. Won't be strung up for   not doing it. Don't see a reason for taking it out.    CO: Does "restore defaults" count for 3.2.5?    CMN: Not entirely.    DA: Microsoft's OS itself lets you do 3.2.5.    CO: Add to 3.2.5 "allow this by logging in as   a separate user".    DC: Accessible command keys. 3.2.3 should be Pri 2.    CMN: Allowing reconfiguation of controls seems  a general high priority featured.  3.2.5-7 seem candidates to be collapsed.    /* Will discuss with editors off line */    CO: If the developer will do something different,  should be a different technique. When pieces  are included, push them into guidelines.    DA: If this section of the document is the only  place where keyboard controls are discussed,  must be priority 1. If discussed elsewhere more  specifically, could be pri 2 here.    CO: The ability to configure keyboard access for  every application is a worthy feature. Don't think  should be priority 1 technique since it doesn't  prevent access. Few people yelling at MS "Can't  use your browser since I can't remap the keys."    JB: Few cases where inability to remap would   make access impossible.    CO: This is Bryan Campbell's big issue. He's a big advocate  of the ability to remap and we've discussed extensively.    JB: Chair, how do we proceed to establish the priority  level.    <span class="action">Action CMN, CO, KH, DA:</span> Will  reexamine priority of 3.2.3.    Section 3.3    IJ: "equivalent textual representation" means "captions".   Does this mean "alt text" as well? How to explain what   this means to novice readers?    CH: Please clarify whether "equivalent textual  representation" also means "alt text".    <span class="action">Action editors:</span> Clear this  up.    /* CO discusses rendering of dimensions of alt text     vs dimensions of image */    WAC 3.3.7: Generalize scripts to programmatic objects  and include applets.    CO: In addition to scripts, add techniques related  to the loading and execution of embedded objects.    IJ: The definition of "programmatic objects" is  important.    GG: Is the browser obligated to tell the server   that it's not capable of loading the objects.    DD: Not an issue.    DD: 3.3.9. How is this different from 4.1.14.    IJ: Rendering different from ability to turn on/off.    WAC: Suggest referring to related techniques.    CO:     3.3.2: Define "video". A lot done through embedded     objects. The UA may not be aware of what's happening.     In the case of animations, the UA is aware of this.     (3.3.5, 3.3.6).    3.3.3: UA not available of what's going on in an OBJECT.    MH: I have the same comment. From the user's perspective,      animated gifs, etc. all considered "video". I want      to turn off "moving stuff".    DC: Goes back to independent vs. dependent UAs. This      is a guideline for dependent UAs.    DD: Qualify all of these with "when the user agent knows".     Also, if you can turn off embedded content (3.3.7)       you accomplish the goal of turning of video effects.    IJ: Proposed: "Where knows" and give details in     techniques document (e.g., bgsound).    CMN: Version 2 of IE has menus "Play sounds", "Play     video".    WAC: Knowledge about object types through MIME types.    IJ: That goes in the techniques document.    WAC: Propose "blinking, moving, or changing" content.    CO: 3.3.4. Does this include alt text? (see above)      3.3.5. Make into "animated and blinking text".      3.3.8. On/Off support for style sheets. Need             to separate support for author and user             style sheets. Don't think turning off             is a priority 1.      3.3.9. This is a rendering issue. Disagree with             Priority and placement.    /* Lunch */    HB: Should turn/off be all or nothing? Would like     to turn off images generally, but select one     and view it. Add this to intro of section 3.3    DC: That would be a P2.     DA: Features may interfere with "or enhance" (add this)      accessibility.        JG: Distinguish user from author style sheets.    WAC: 3.3.8 should be Pri 1 since style sheets can  do crazy things.    DC: Not a given who has final control (user or author).  Priority 1 is that user have final say.    DD: There are things you cannot change with a user style    sheet but that you can turn off, e.g., with a button.    E.g., knowing which property I've used to achieve    a certain effect may not be obvious.    KH: Did some investigation about this for IE 5 and    became clear that this is not a simple problem.    E.g., positioning. If I turn off positioning when    there are layering effects, what happens?    WAC: IE3 used to allow turn on/off. Netscape allows  you to do it. It's possible. Positioning without  style sheets means use document order.    IJ: UA shouldn't be responsible for choosing a  "next best rendering". Should just render in  document order in general case.    KH: What problem is solved by 3.3.9? Assistive techs  are solving the problem quite adequately.    JB: A lot of discussion about this at "Closing the  Gap". If you are using a screen reader, frame issues  may be solved by a screen reader.    WAC: Small screen issue. Learning disability problems  as well.    KH: I can understand cognitive issue. Mobility issue  solved with navigation. What is it priority 1?    MH: How do access keys interact with different frames?    Can't access navbar type frame when focus in a separate    frame.    KH: Haven't tried this out.    /* Discussion postponed until CO returns */    JG: For 4.1, change to "override author styles  and adjust user agent defaults".    DA: If you use that language, would that mean that  using the "return to default settings" mean factory  defaults?    IJ: "Default values" means the value when the UA  starts. Want to be able to change that dynamically,  without changing default value. (e.g., Using 27 point  font currently for the purposes of a projector,  but want 8point when I start up emacs tomorrow in  the office). Don't agree that should be "adjust"  UA defaults.     DC: Change by profile?    CNM: Profiles are Pri 3 currently.    4.1.5/6: Change "foreground and background color" to   "presentation" (e.g., could use underlining, different    voice quality, background music, etc.)    CO: That's a big request. Configurability of the focus     rectangle is a big request we get. Can use CSS     to accomplish the goal of changing focus. /* Ian     proposes discussing this in the techniques document */       Propose separating techniques for different     conditions.     DC: Make media independent.    <span class="action">Action Editors:</span> Propose  wording that is slightly more general, but doesn't  bind UAs for media types not supported. Move specific  examples to techniques document.    Re: 4.1.7 Is there a need to control background  images? Doesn't the ability to turn on/off background  images?     Resolved: Add to 3.3 turn on/off background images  and remove from 4.1.    Marja: What's the fallback presentation?    CO: Good question! Rules as I understand them:  1) if no background image, is it set in HTML?  2) if set in CSS, use that.  3) otherwise use OS background color. This may     be overridden.    DA: Foreground and background imaging must be      independent.    JT: Whatever is done to establish background color,      is this covered in the spec?    JG: Yes.    DA: 4.1.8. Users may want to control rate of  animation to have access to the information (and  not just turn on and off).    CO: I've spoken with several programmers about this.  In case of animated GIF, UAs know rate, can scale and  stop it. Changing frame rate not a Pri 1. Stopping  would be a Pri 1.    DC: Not sure I agree. If showing the action is  critical to getting the content, turning off  alone doesn't suffice. Information must be  conveyed elsewhere.    CO: I agree. Important, but not a must. Billboards,  for example that change quickly.     WAC: For ads, I agree. But for information critical  to understanding (e.g., how to tie a bow-tie), I think  it should be a priority one.    DA: One of the applications of animations is to   demonstrate processes. If the object is embedded,  the mainstream browser may not need to provide  the control. But the functionality must exist.    IJ: Proposed clarification: "When the UA knows  how to access the animation rate for an  object." (to 4.1.8).    CO: We're working on adding a metric related to  "reading rate".    IJ proposal:    2) Add wording that control by rendering agent    3) Add wording that control when UA has access       to those particular properties of the object.      1) Is animation rate the only issue?       GH: People will need to start and stop           as well.       CO: Pause. Start means from beginning.       HB: Need to be able to backup a little as well.         CO: Proposed user interface for animations: allow       tabbing to animations. Use keys to control       animation. Also could have vcr-style controls       (speed up, slow down).         MH: How do users know what's what and what rules       apply to different types of objects.         DC: I think we're going too far down the        implementation path. Just allow users to have       final control over active media objects.         CO: That's a problem regardless today.          MH: The issue is consistency of controls.        Vcr-controls exist for other types of objects.         DC: Is consistency covered by referring to       OS standards?         CO: Possibly. But real-audio may not use the       same keys.         <span class="action">Action editors:</span>       Propose wording about (1) per image control       [what priority] and global control [what priority]       (2) control of rate Pri 1 (3) control of       start, stop, pause, continue priority 2 (4)       support by rendering agent.         DA: Consistent controls would be a priority       2 concern, not priority 1 in any case.         IJ: Seems outside the scope of this group.         DC: Careful about choosing priorities. Certain       groups, but not others, may benefit/suffer due       to priority choices.    Same issues apply to 4.1.9 as to 4.1.8.    Do same issues apply to audio issues?    WAC: For 4.1.12 change "a specific" to "among available  tracks."    CMN: The user agent is the one rendering the information.    MH: Yes, but from the user's perspective, you share  the same view. Need consistency across media types.          HB: Should the user profile include information about  what users never want.    DA: Don't want to have to turn off styles when  racing against a seizure.    CO: 4.1.10 will be changed to include "when UA aware  of rate".    /* Note: CSS2 may be used to specify volume */    CO: Why is control of volume priority 1?    DA: Use the external volume control.     JB: Not all boxes have a manual volume control.    CO: Shouldn't be a priority 1 since other ways  to get at content.    DA: The information would not be available to     some groups.    CO: 4.1.12: Should be stricken.    CMN: 4.1.13 Need also to control pitch/tone. This is a CSS2  property as well.    CO: Is supporting "CSS2 aural" a priority 1?    CMN: If you're not using CSS to control them, but  still rendering speech, still need to provide  a means to control.    DC: Rendering agent is the entity that must be   controllable.    CO: Put in 4.1 : Here are the techniques for these  things. If you support these things, do them.   Otherwise, don't have to.    IJ: We say that in techniques document.    CH: About speech. What does "support" for speech  mean? Rendering? Highlighting? Text to speech?    CO: "SAPI" is MS's speech API.    CH: What's the UA in this case?    CO: The browser is not aware of some of the things  going on.    MH: I'll speak for the UA... want to  be able to speed up, slow down, etc. But need  to be clear about recorded speech or synthesized  speech. Affects what you need to eo.    CMN: If call it techniques for automatically generated  speech, where browser is creating speech, and you want rate,  volumn, and pitch control, could put it into techniques for  rendered audio. Would provide the clarity.    DA: If talking about recorded speech, that's just audio.  Then could do pitch maintenance by audio playback.    MH: with pitch rendering    HB: user profiles may need to pass info to UA.    CO: I would shy away from profiles. Platforms should support  these things. These are cross-component issues.  Info should be sharable.    Proposed: Be able to change the pitch  of audio files. What priority?    JT: Would this exclude a group?    JB: Yes, e.g., those hard of hearing.    CO: I recognize its importance. But should it  be a priority 1.    WAC: Issue of captions again. Can't assume that  they will be provided. Will be helpful and  necessary if captions not provided.    DA: Recall that priorities not based on number  of people but on locking people at.    JB: You're locking out (1) aging population  (vision + hearing loss) and (2) deaf/blind  community with range loss. Yes, I believe it  locks some groups out.    CO: Each decision will lock out some community.  Have to make decision about benefitting greatest  number of users as well.    DD: Not all techniques are related to media perception.  Some are related to convenience, etc. So not true  that all would become Priority 1.    JB: Multimedia is a difficult area for the growing  Web. Also an area with not as much advocacy  from different groups.     /* Where did 4.1.15 and 4.1.16 come from?     IJ: Paul A. / Scott L */    CO: Several issues      1) Need to control window size based on user need      2) Need to control window position based on user need     Should allow users to turn off automatically spawned     windows.    WAC: PAGL says don't use popup windows. But also relies  on UAs in the future to warn users.    DD: I consider 4.1.15/4.1.16 to belong more to the  section on the user interface. Distinguish that  which happens due to HTML from that which happens  due to interface (e.g., warning). How do you  warn users that a window will pop up? By popping  up a window?    CO: This is also a security issue. I want an option  that says "prompt me" when new windows are requested.    Tech 1: Turn off entirely    Tech 2: Prompt before.    Windows pop up all the time. UAs have to deal with them.  Don't make this a Priority 1 unless we tell vendors  of other applications to do this as well.    MK: Any way for UA to know which windows are available?    CMN: No "windows" menu as in Word.    CO: If a new windows popup, a few things happen    a) Programmatic things happen. Screen readers have       access to that information.    b) In windows, you get info somewhere in the environment.    GG: I basically agree with CO assuming there's  an accessibility aid available. But if not, problem  not addressed.    CMN: Propose Pri 2 to 4.1.15/16. Also shift to section  three.    CO: Proposed interface: Allow/Don't allow/Prompt.  Don't know that we would allow resizable.    CO: Spawning windows part of Javascript environment.  What can one do?    CMN: You can disable resize, scroll, etc.    DD: Style guide should say "If you press a button,  a dialog will appear". There's a convention in the  way menus are displayed to give clues to the user.  In HTML, value of "_blank" for the "target" attribute  means UA might open a new window.     IJ: Add to techniques document - for target="_blank" UA  should inform the user according to the user's  customization.    JT: One reason windows are annoying is for people  with visual/cognitive limitations. Not necessarily  that they don't want them, just that they don't  want to be disoriented by them.    JB: These are not usability guidelines. These  are accessibility guidelines.    CO: Another real-world example - HTML in email  messages. Your browser is started up and  disorients as well.    IJ: How much should "usability" and "accessibility"  be mixed?    JB: Procurement requirements ususally based  on accessibility needs, not usability.     /* Break 3pm  */    /* Daniel on minutes */    Table issues: please consult 9 Dec minutes.    JG: Issue is relationship to screen reader (read cross col)      Issue also with Table used as layout tool      2 kinds of Table: layout, tabular       Different levels of linearization are possible      (based on presence of markup or not, kind of table)      If not done native in the browser, the assistive      technology can use an API to implement it (DOM, DHTML,      MSAA). But APIs are not yet standard across browsers    CMN: Can also use CSS positioning    JG: Another concept relevant to table navigation is the      point of regard. People want to move up and down,      row or col, switch directions, etc.    IJ: Users want cell level access: reformating and navigation       are two ways of doing that. That's P1. More navigation      improves contextual access (where you are, what column      header is relevant). The goal is to define level of      table access to prioritize and decide what's done      natively or not.        DA: Surrounding information is more than header.    IJ: linearization is not the only way.    DA: linearization is sometimes not approriate (Statistics      data for instance)    CO: Keyboard Navigation not the ideal solution  GG: Given the bits on the screen, wants the information      in the structure, and the other way  IJ: mapping backward harder (DOM people working on it)  CO: Going from x,y to the element was added in DHTML.    MH: looking at daisy book, it's not just for table, need      information of navigation significence.    DA: Navigation long table/document thru element is not      adequate, you need to be able to go thru larger chunk.    IJ: lots of navigation schema in the guidelines:      hierarchical, thru list, by link, etc. Not eveything is      there , but there's lot.    DA: May want to navigate arbitrary element.    MH: in webspeak, we added the ability thru preference to      declare which elements are navigable (maybe done thru      some style sheet syntax)    JG: one question is what AT wants        DC: Search functionality gives an example of things where      the browser     DA: both cell rendering and and cell context information are      vital, regardless how it's done.    CO: Some screen readers use API to provide cell by cell      access.     IJ: still want to push the most important thing: individual      cell information rendered as block, which sounds easy      and already supported in the code.    CO: don't want to say it's easy when talking about about      new development.     IJ: CSS1 supports block display on all element  CO: maybe already solved  IJ: implementation question, not guidelines    DD: Jaws does table unrolling because IE doesn't do it    JB: how many screen readers do table unrolling    JG: overall, what strategy will solve accessibility the best      way: done by browser or done by AT ?    WAC: IE Powertool is an in-between approach that works fine.    JG: similar to running a user script on load that would      improve the layout    DA: issue of who would write the scripts  JG: WAI may help?    CH: I favor nagivation and native linearization thru simple      user action    GG: like the idea of running script doing linearization      that user or AT could fire.    JT: responsibility is shared between browser and AT    CO: maybe have two different techniques: P1 make cell      information available, P2: Provide this information      natively and possibly navigation as well.    JT: General navigation issue: Keyboard-based selection    of anything in an HTML doc that isn't a link/active     element?    /* Ian on minutes */    DD: CSS has the 'display' property with 'block' value.  From  the CSS2 spec: "Conforming HTML user agents may ignore the  'display' property." In the WAI guidelines, we could make it  a (Pri 1) requirement. Thus, for table linearization,  simple application of CSS.    CO: CSS is always a great way to implement stuff.    CO: Re selection copying. We get this request all the  time. Two ways: 1) Search for particular text.   2) Save page as text file, open in text editor  to use selection copy.    MH: Word 97 has feature on scrollbar to allow  navigation by element.    DA: Point of highlighting text is not to retype it.  If you have to copy to find box to highlight and  then to copy is pointless.    /* On W3C post-REC support */    JB:  1) For WAI in general, there has always been  a recognition of the need for promotion and  encouragement of implementations based on  accessibility improvements. WAI IPO set  up for this reason, among others.    2) At W3C in general, movement to improve   post-Recommendation follow-up and promotion.  Historically, advocacy done by other organizations.  But now W3C management feels the need to  support "life after Rec". In particular, the CSS  Working Group has pushed hard by creating  (or monitoring the creation of)  test suites,  validation tools, etc. the SYMM WG is in a similar  position of monitoring support.    JG: Would WAI be responsible for educating assistive  technology developers?    JB: Could be part of WAI's responsibility. Also  push to have assistive technologies move towards  standardization of interfaces.    CO: Agree that our job would be easier if there  were standard interfaces to plug into. What more is  needed?    JB: Not everyone uses Windows. To answer Jon's  question, yes, could fit into WAI's scope. However,  not only WAI's responsibility.    CO: There are similar standards on Unix/Apple systems, but  few tools that require it.    JG: Provide code for platforms.    JB: It could be well within WAI's scope to educate  developers for important accessibility issues. We  don't have the ability or role to enforce. The WG  must bear that in mind when writing the guidelines.  No guarantee from W3C to enforce.    CO: Lack of participation from other browser manufacturers  is indicative of the uphill battle.    DC: Must be as frugal as possible with our priority  1s. We have to be realistic if we want these guidelines  implemented.    CO: Discussion on the IG list lately about the PAGL  being too much.    HB: Any time a Pri 1 shows up. How do we justify it?    JB: At WAI EO WG meeting this morning, discussion about  the "AIEE, it's huge!" thread on the mailing list.  Upshot of discussion in that group: the stuff in the PAGL  needs to be there. The detail needs to be there. The  PAGL WG used to have a checklist and this would be  valuable again. We want the content, but need different  ways to slice it.    KH: My personal opinion that the guidelines represent  a wish list more than industry reality. Would like  to reduce number of Priority 1 items. If Pri 1, should  a tech be native if affects a large number of users?  No one wants "all the stuff" pushed on them, either  mainstream browsers or assistive techs.    DC: Laws vs. Regulation. We're doing regulation without    defining the basic laws. If we come up with the laws    that have to be met ...    JB: I'm concerned about the analogy you're proposing.  This is not a legal or regulatory environment. This  is a voluntary, consensus-based WG.    IJ: Not "wish list" but expression of accessibility  requirements. Industry concerns are built-in by  virtue of this discussion.    DA: I agree with DC that we must be frugal with  our Priority 1s. But don't want to fall into the  trap of "easy vs. hard." The issue is "accessible  vs. inaccessible".    JB: I too like "Frugal with Priority 1". We've been  talking about screen readers a lot, but there  are other disabilities involved that would not  have screen readers.    CO: Process questions   1) Yes, this WG should be collecting, validating,    and quantifying data. And then working with developers    saying "here's the wish list, what's practical?"     "If you don't this, you're impacting this set of people."    Look at 5.1.3.: Provide user with info about number of    tables in a document.      JB: If we create a wish list first and browser        manufacturers say what's practical, then browser        manufacturers could say "zero", and others will         follow.      IJ: Describes how stuff gets in the document. Editors        take what shows up on the list. WG is responsible        for reviewing the document. Editors do the best        they can to glean information and proposed text        from the list. And we announce changes at publication.      CO: What's happened is that someone says something and        it goes into the document.      DA: As part of the WG, you can say "I don't think        that should be a priority 1 technique" and start        a dialogue about how people or groups of people        might be shut out.      JB: If an item comes in from the list is it automatically        a priority 1?        IJ: No. It may be if similar techniques are rated that        way.        JB: This process is *not* clean and easy. The result        should be a list of requirements that are realistic.        Life gets harder towards the end of the document.        The WG cannot put off the prioritization of the        techniques any longer.      JG: Do we have the techniques that we want?      JG: We've talked about tables and navigation. How        would we rewrite guidelines?          IJ: Providing "cell level info" is not enough. It's        just part of the document like any other piece.      DC: Is our purpose to provide a developer checklist        or to have general working premisses we want        followed. I say this because the last draft        too ambiguous and we decided we wanted it more        broken out since that would make it more quantifiable.        Now, broken out, people are protesting it's too        specific (or long). This indicates we have opposite        and conflicting goals.      JT: We had the same discussion in the AU group. We        shouldn't be too draconian to allow vendors to        distinguish their products. We should say that        this is what we need and why we want it. We will        know that you've met this need if this happens.      JG: How do we do this for tables?      CO: Three levels       1) Requirements gathering and prioritization.        WG solicits input, does usability studies. Gets        input about what problems exist. This WG presents        some information that I don't hear from users.       2) Potential solutions and triage of requirements        Work with developers here.       3) Actual solutions        This is announced in developer press releases        after the product comes out.        I think the WG doesn't work enough at Level 1. The     goal of the WG is to produce a document at Level 2.       So:       1) Pri 1: Access to table information       2) Pri 2: Unrolling of tables       IJ: Chuck, why didn't we hear the requirements that      you've gleaned.        CO:        1) Lack of time      2) Discouragement because ideas have been booed down.         In general, chorus of boos when MS makes proposals.          E.g., my developer says it's hard to unroll          tables in code. A limit to how much arguing          one wants to do.       JB: UAGL WG has not been chartered to do usability         studies (nor has funding). Also, if you have         your own collection of barriers, please share         these with the WG.           Dave made important points about "back and forth"         editing - more specific to less specific. But         CO's proposal would slow us down again. I know         a lot of people would like to finish quickly.           For tomorrow's discussion, people are encouraged         to speak to as much detail as possible.           I think that CO's comments can still be resolved         with some refocusing of the document. I hope they         do not reflect complete dissatisfaction with the         document.           DA: About the ease/difficulty of unrolling tables.         Distinguish barriers to implementation from          barriers to accessibility. Unless you're coding,         you don't know the barriers to implementation. But         we can't say "that's not a problem" if people         don't have access.           DC: My one concern about the Priority approach         does not take a cross-section of different          disability populations. Focuses on the most vocal         groups with the largest number of users. That         concerns me.            JB: Please note that cross-disability was called         for last week. Also for people to examine          priority levels. I hope we will also get more         participation out of this.           JT: Re linearization of tables - The need is         not linearization.

Get input  from           MSAA developers as well. Craft email to PF WG with Ian        Status: Dropped.    2) Issue CR#196:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#196     It is unclear to developers how they know they conform to     Checkpoint 6.2: Conform to W3C specifications when they     are appropriate        Resolved:       1.Change wording "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are       available and appropriate for a task."      2.Add note: Implementing one accessible format      3.Add techniques: From ATAG "Specifications that become W3C       Recommendations after a user agent's development cycles permit       input are not considered "available" in time."        Action IJ: Implement this resolution.       DA: This is basically saying: Use W3C, then system standards, then         your own accessible methods. "When they are appropriate" means         "if there's a straightforward way with a W3C spec, you should         do this.       KB: I have no problem with this wording and the accompanying note.        3) Issue CR#197:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#197     Not clear with the scope of user preferences is in Checkpoint 10.7        Resolved:        1.Narrow scope to that which is specified in the guidelines       as configurable (style and input config).     2.Add technique: Accessible browser project portable configuration                      file      IJ: Note that Netscape uses X resources, which can be used on         any X-windows enabled machine.       Action DP: Send NN profile info.       Action IJ: Implement this resolution.    4) Issue CR#198:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#198     How much information needs to be provided to satisfy Checkpoint 8.4         Proposed Resolution:        1.Make current list of items is minimum requirement, plus any that we       may have missed        DP: How does a UA know the size?         JG: Do a GET on the header?       DA: Do you want this always for all links, or just be able to         query the link? Could be expensive to do if it's not query.       DP: I think it is useful to have this available when the link is         rendered. Query/rendered should be configurable.       CMN: I think we should specify "what's available to the browser"          without having to go get information from HTTP calls.          Note that this also depends on the linking mechanism.       IJ:        - What's in the markup (attributes, content)       - What's the UA's state about the link.       - External information it could get.       IJ: Charles has proposed the first two types of info.       DA: Seems reasonable as minimal information.       JG: Who decides whether you satisfy the checkpoint?       CMN: It's known since in spec or the UA knows this info.        Resolved:          - Change checkpoint text to be something like:         "Make available author-supplied and user agent          state information about links."       - Add technique to distinguish this info from fetched.         (more than the minimal requirement)       Action IJ: Implement this resolution.    5) Issue CR#199:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#199     Poor wording of checkpoint 10.8, it is not clear what the     requirement is to improve accessibility       Resolved:       1.Ensure that frequently used functions are easily       activated in the default configuration.        2.Add technique: Use operating system conventions to indicate                      configuration.       DP: How do you verify easily?       IJ: How did ATAG deal with this?       CMN: There is subjectivity in this, but this is a reasonable person          type test.       DA: What are frequently used functions? Navigation, accessing         pages, etc.       Action IJ: Implement this resolution.      6) CR#200:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#200     Checkpoint 5.5 on timely exchanges, developers not unclear on how     they know they have satisfied this checkpoint       Resolution Options:        1.Merge requirement in with other applicable checkpoints       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0359.html      2.Ian's pending proposal        IJ:       - Drop it.       - Leave it as is.        - Leave it as is with an example (note) relating to in process          communication.       - Comparable performance to what you get from scripts.         JG: We don't know what that performance is.         MN: But that performance level accepted in the industry.             If we could get AT performance with what scripting             can do now...         MQ: But hard to quantify the performance of scripts...       - Distinguish static from dynamic? AT developers thought         static just as important.       DA: I don't think we should drop it.     CMN: I feel strongly it shouldn't be dropped.      KB: Does this fit into the category of general accessible          application design?       IJ: Why is this problem different from a slow download.     CMN: If the page downloads and starts doing something while          you're doing something, you'll never know what happened.      DP: Like playing your video tape before your television picture          has appeared.      JG: How about: "Use programming techniques that ensure a timely                      exchange of information."          The programmer can't do better than what's available to the          programmer/os.       KB: Does this make it more verifiable?        JG: Say clearly in a note that developers should be looking          for the most effective techniques.        KB: To me this sounds like general programming advice that's          not specific to user agents.        RS: I think it's smart to say that you want to avoid          cross-process communication.         CMN: This is an implementation requirement. Our problem           is expressing the requirement in words other than           examples.         JG: Can we talk about it in terms of "conventions"?         RS: The conventions of today are too slow.          Resolved:          - Leave checkpoint as is and add an example note.     7) CR#201:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#201     5.5 "Ensure that programmatic exchanges proceed in a timely manner"          should be a priority 1        DA: P1 for dynamic pages.     RS: Also for large static docs.     IJ: I oppose P1 for static, since information is still available.

(P1)     JG: Also, 2.2       RS: MSAA may not have been used extensively in the past due         to performance issues.     IJ: You fail 2.1 (access to all content) if you don't make         available content that is changing. This is already P1.      CMN, RS, MN: I can live with this, though a sludgy way around this.

GR: Recall, that access to frame alt requirement was dropped         for a note, but the note no longer there:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Mechanisms for specifying alternative content vary according to markup  language. For instance, in HTML or SMIL, the "alt" attribute specifies  alternative text for many elements. In HTML, the content of the OBJECT  element  is used to specify alternative content, the "summary" attribute applies  to  tables, etc. In HTML, the NOFRAMES element specifies alternative content  for  frames. The ability to access frame alternatives is important for users  of some  screen readers and users with some cognitive impairments.   </BLOCKQUOTE>       Resolved: Ian will edit this and add to definition of               alternative equivalents for content.    9) CR#204:      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#204     Add collated text to Checkpoint 2.6 and 4.8 or create a new     checkpoint at lower priority        Proposed Resolution:        1.Add collated text to checkpoints       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0343.html        MK: If it's not synchronized, no problem.

      Hello,    In January (minutes [1]) I received an action item  about a proposal I sent to the WG last summer [2].  My apologies for the delays, but here is the reproposal.    Issue: It is not clear in WCAG 1.0 that authors do not         need to use language features that are not          supported by user agents.    Proposal:    Add the following clarification to the list of errata  and the techniques document:       <BLOCKQUOTE>      It is not clear in WCAG 1.0 that authors are not      required to use markup language or style sheet      language features that are not supported by user agents.         Checkpoint 11.1 only requires authors to use technologies       that are available and appropriate. If user agents do not       support a particular feature it is not "available" and      therefore authors are not required to use it.      Furthermore, checkpoints that require the use of that      feature do not apply until there is user agent support      for that feature.        This clarification affects (at least) the      following checkpoints:           3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1,          5.2, 5.5., 5.6, 6.4, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 12.1, 12.4,          and 13.2.         NOTE for Checkpoint 3.3:          Where HTML style attributes or elements overlap with         CSS properties, authors may use the HTML style         attributes in addition to the CSS properties.         Refer to section 6.4.4 of the CSS2 Recommendation         for more information about precedence in this case.    </BLOCKQUOTE>    In a new WCAG document, we might want to introduce  the notion of "applicable checkpoint", used in UAAG  (but not in ATAG).     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/20000120.html  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0183.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Would  you choose to put the HTML 4 spec in the same place as UAAG 1.0?  Probably not as there may be name conflicts.     These are two separate resources, and assuming that the names  of files are necessarily different and always will be is a   dangerous assumption. I do not want to encourage that assumption  by using a naming mechanism that allows people to unload  all of them in the same directory.    In short: I think it's harmful to make the assumption that  the documents can co-exist in the same directory.     > 3. i couldn't find a listing of ACCESSKEYs for each component of the  > modularized UAAG -- shouldn't the "Previous" "Next" and "Contents" have  > ACCESSKEYs associated with them?    Yes, good idea.

MQ: I will be leaving isSound at the end of the month.      IJ: You are still invited to attend the calls!    ==========  Discussion  ==========    1.Issue #405: Checkpoint 4.17: Need stronger requirement to distinguish   selection/focus  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#405    Refer to result of JG's proposals.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0407.html    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0415.html    IJ: Why is the last sentence necessary? I think that the only reason  conflict arises is due to user. I think that warning the user that  they have chosen settings that might conflict. But there's a big  processing hit to require special treatment.     EH: Doesn't seem like a P1 requirement to give people a heads-up that  there's a risk of one hiding the other.    Resolved:    1) Adopt:       4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus and current     selection are highlighted (e.g., through foreground and background     color, voice pitch, etc.). The default highlight styles must not     rely on color alone. The default focus and selection styles must     also differ from each other, and not through color alone. If text     decorations (e.g., underlining, strike through, over-line, etc.) or     border styles are used as a highlight mechanism, the user must be     able to configure them according to the range of text decoration or     border styles available on the system.     2) Delete 4.16.    3) Include in techniques:       - Heads-up for the case when an element has both        selection and focus, and there exists a       conflict between styling (i.e., color, border style, text       decoration). They should be distinguishable.     - Perhaps warn the user when they configure styling that       there's a risk of conflict.    2.Issue #406: Checkpoint 4.18: Lower to Priority 3  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#406    JG Summarizing: The point of the reviewer is that if the user  can navigate back, then just an annoyance.    RS: That's true unless they use a system modal dialog box. That grabs  focus and doesn't release it. In that case, you may not be able to  switch back.    IJ: What happens if 4 windows open? Then it's a serious problem.    GR: If focus changes and you are unaware that it has changed, you may  enter data in a form without realizing it, for example.    JA: Or accept something that you didn't want to accept.    RS: But the AT should announce the new window.    JG: But there may be a delay before the AT can respond.    MQ: I think that the reason that this is an accessibility issue is  that the change of focus is very disorienting. The other issue is a  user interface issue that everyone has to face.    GR: This topic is also being discussed in the ATAG WG because of  prompts they discuss.    JG: Note that ATs receive information about windows that have opened  even if they haven't received focus. They can announce to user at a  later time.     RS: But for the same reason you don't want to be interrupted,  the AT won't tell you.    IJ: What do ATs do today when a new window opens?    TL: Three ways ATs get information from IE:  a) They can track GDI calls  b) They can read the DOM  c) They can read the MSAA. So if IE opens a window, these  events go in the message queue that the AT is presumed to listen to.    JG: So if a browser doesn't give focus, does MSAA still give the   information to the AT?    TL: Yes.    RS: The situation is not cut-and-dry.    TL: To do an interesting experiment, use outlook and set a bunch  of appointments at the same time. Watch what happens...    Resolved:    - Due to orientation issue, this should remain a P2.    3.Issue #407: Checkpoint 4.20: Include requirement to control automatic   closing of viewports  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#407    JG: Are disappearing windows more of a problem for people with  disabilities?    GR: If you can see the window close, you know that it closes.     IJ: Does MSAA indicate that a window has closed?    TL: Yes.    GR: The only auto-closing windows I am aware of is opened when you get  streamed media. A popup shows an ad, then closes when the streaming  media arrives.    DP: Do we want to add a requirement we don't have implementation  experience for?    TL: It is possible to close windows with javascript.     DP: IE does this today and handles this well. For spawned windows,  IE will prompt before some windows closed.    TL: The bank that I do online banking with, when you click "log out",  it sends a message to the UA window. IE prompts before closing the  window.    JG: Add?    Yes: GR, MQ, IJ, TL, JA,     RS: I don't think we need this. I think it's overkill.    TL: Is this an authoring issue? There's a "close" method in the DOM.    JG: It is an authoring problem as well. But it's a common problem.    RS: My concern is that if we add a new requirement, we will have to  go back to last call again.     RS: I don't think this is a widespread accessibility problem.    Resolved:   - Accept reviewer's proposal as a P3 requirement:        Allow configuration to not close windows except         with user confirmation.   - Evaluate later if we want to raise the priority.    Action IJ: Add a checkpoint.    4.Issue #408: Checkpoint 4.20: Allow configuration to prompt to open,   not force manual open.  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#408    JG: Manually includes responding "yes" to a prompt.    Resolved:   - Editorial.      Action IJ: Add a clarification.    5.Issue #409: Checkpoint 4.20: If frames are not opened, what is result?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#409    IJ: A viewport may contain others. I think we are only concerned with  the toplevel viewport.    GR: But they are subject to everything else (e.g., access to content).    IJ: Recall - this checkpoint for cognitive and physical (due to  navigation). What's the impact in the case of frames? I don't really  think there's much of a difference between a new frame or a new window  from the user's perspective. But it does feel different.    JG: What if the frame doesn't look like one?    IJ: Still an issue for navigation.    GR: What about inline frames?    Proposed:     - Narrow focus of checkpoint to only apply to a top-level      viewport of a tree of viewports.    IJ: I don't see any distinction between frames and windows.    TL: Technically, prior to IE5, frames were in their own windows.  Yes, they pose the same problem. I think that how they are turned  off is more of an authoring issue.    /* TL leaves */    Resolved:   - Add last sentence: "If a viewport includes other      viewports, then this requirement only applies to the topmost     viewport."   - Add a Note that other requirements still apply to sub-viewports.    Action IJ: Add these.    /* RS leaves */    6.Issue #410: Checkpoint 4.21: Is this redundant to 4.20?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#410    Resolved:      - Delete second sentence of 4.21 since redundant with 4.20.    Action IJ: Delete sentence from 4.21.    7.Issue #411: Checkpoint 4.21: Not just for GUIs but for any interface   with overlapping viewports  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#411    Resolved:      - Definition of "graphical" already includes text-based.   - Add to end of first sentence "with which it overlaps".    Action IJ: Add text to 4.21.    8.Issue #412: Checkpoint 5.8: Editorial association between first and   second sentences.  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#412    Resolved:     - Add "that benefit accessibility" to end of second sentence.    Action IJ: Add text to 5.8     EH: We could also try to combine the sentences.    9.Issue #413: Checkpoint 6.2: Does this only apply to content?  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#413    Resolved: No change.   - We agree, this is only for content.   - The checkpoint is in a section on checkpoints for content.   - Even covered in checklist.    10.Issue #414: Checkpoint 7.3: Need stronger min requirements  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#414    Resolved:     - No change for now. Given our current priority definition and     our current interpretation of it, it would still be possible     to access all content.    Action JG: Contact Greg Lowney and ask for a counter-proposal  about minimal requirement.    ==========  Action Items  ==========  --------  Completed:  --------    JG: Talk to Cindy King about captioning      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0390.html    JG: Write a proposal to the WG this week for a checkpoint about  discerning       focus from selection all the time      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0389.html      IJ: Note that there are some issues with this proposal.

         WAI UA WG Face to Face  Cambridge, MA  12 December 1998    Chair: Jon Gunderson (JG)  Scribe: Ian Jacobs (IJ)    Participants:  Olivier Borius (OB)  David Clark (DC)  Kathy Hewitt (KH)  Daniel Dardailler (DD)  Glen Gordon (GG)  Wilson Craig (WC)  Charles McCathieNeville(CMN)  Denis Anson (DA)  Chuck Oppermann (CO)  Harvey Bingham (HB)  Wendy Chisholm (WAC)  Markku Hakkinen (MH)  Judy Brewer (JB)    ---------------  8:30 am    JG: We're not moving forward enough. I would  like to propose the following (conceived with  DA last night): Split document into two guidelines  those for visual and those for non-visual user agents.  How does this affect compliance? Compliance based  on what media type a UA supports. Note that one  company's compliance should not depend on another  company's compliance.    DA: Background - one assumption: niche market browsers  only provide the functionality specific to their  market. But warning: a UA might say that their  niche market is mouse-using visual. Allowing compliance  in that area would not be acceptable.    IJ: We already have the pieces in the document. See  section 1.1 of the techniques document. Need to  integrate that into conformance. But conformance  by one company must not depend on conformance or  even existence of another company's product.  The guidelines must be written so that this  is possible.    JB: Denis' background was helpful. But I don't  know how conformance implies breaking into  several documents.      WAC:   1) We had similar discussions in the PAGL WG.  We ended up with two documents, split according  to certain dependencies.   2) Agree with need to comply based on     media. Several checklists (media split).    MH: The term "UA" is already a tricky term.  It includes a lot of devices. Let's define  UA clearly, but in one document.    CMN: As RMIT's member until two weeks ago,  under the impression that we didn't divide  the world based on niche markets, but rather  media type dependencies.    DC: I understand the impetus for the proposal,  but I have concerns about it. Need to distinguish  source from rendering. Of course IE is not a  voice browser. But that doesn't mean they can  say "we don't know need to support rendering  content auditorially since that's not our  purpose." Difference between inter and intra  media interpretations. All UAs need to  facilitate inter media rendering. Other concern:  saying assistive technologies can do something  doesn't get us further. Users still need to  buy the other products to get the job done.  I can walk up to any MS machine and can use  it thanks to built-in keyboard support and  accessibility.    HB: If we fragment this document into special case  needs, we must do the interface definitions very  carefully.    MH: I agree with DC and HB. Also a question for  MS - where will my handheld computer fall?    /* IJ shows how media types are used in the  CSS 2 specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2 */    WC: If we split into two documents, how will  compliance be measured? Who will I claim compliance  to?    CMN: To follow up: we should not split the document.    Consensus: The WG will produce one guidelines  document (with a techniques supplement).    DD: Media conformance (as in CSS) is a more  general solution than a visual/non-visual split.  It wouldn't be practical to split into N documents  for N media types.      It's my opinion that it's more important to      make sure mainstream UAs are compliant rather      than focusing on specialized UAs    MH: I agree with Ian's model as shown in CSS2.  How does co-dependency work? What if a UA  and another in conjunction form a "fully compliant"  UA?     DA: Nice if we can use divisions across documents  (i.e., with CSS2).     KH: I like the media type split idea. If we claim  to support a given media type, we implement natively.  Otherwise we make the information available through  an interface.    JB (to MH's comment): Danger in assistive techs  "sleeping with" mainstream UAs in terms of compliance.  On the one hand, ensures access. But limits competitive  choice.    MH: Important point is that it's not vendor-specific.  If we do this through DOM, I work immediately with  another UA that employs that interface.    DC: Ensure media separation.    DD (to MH): I can't map DOM onto a media-dependency.  I can't force a handheld device to comply with  DOM since there's no way to plug it in. Consider a small  device that does visual but that is too small to  support the DOM.    CMN: Here's where it does apply: In Australia, there are  information kiosks everywhere. There is no  way to plug into that browser.    DD: In addition to media independence, an attribute  such as "I claim to export".     DA: If I'm a device that doesn't do, e.g., video,  how do I support video? Must I support alternative  representations of it?    JG (Summarizing)   1) One document   2) Media type split   3) How to handle unsupported media   4) What happens when a UA can't communicate      with others.    IJ: We're stuck on table linearization because  of dependencies. When each UA is independent  for what it does (w.r.t. a media type) and provides  info through an interface for what it doesn't, we  are all happy. But the case of screen readers shows  another dependency: the screen reader depends  not on the interface but the visual rendering.     JG: We want long-term solutions, not quick fixes.    Resolved: Make full conformance with DOM level 1 a priority  one technique for UAs that export HTML or XML  information.    KH: We do some things with MSAA, others with DOM.    Action editors:     1) Propose conformance text to the mailing list    2) Propose media type text to the mailing list    /* Break */    10am    GG: Good idea to specify the level of functionality  expected (by media type). Standards should not  say how something will be implemented.    IJ: Rationales should describe goal. But  conformance is to a specific list. Conformance  is not to "accessibility" in general.     /* End of conformance discussion */    5.2 Point of regard    5.2.1 Is this a priority 1?     IJ: 5.2.1. For UAs that support multiple views.    DA: Think should be a priority 2.  DD: Think should be a priority 2.  GG: Think should be a priority 2, in particular  since some things have to go (i.e., from  Priority 1s). Jaws used to not provide frame  information and people survived. Now they do  (for IE).    CMN: How does this extend to having multiple  browser processes.    GG: Most screen readers will typically tell  you as you move from window to window and  process to process. Typically title bar info  will tell you where you are.    IJ: Is there some class of disability for  which browsing would be impossible?    CMN: May be an issue for some people  with cognitive impairments.    DA: May be some individuals, but can't  say whether would be impossible for  all people to use.    WAC: Implication for PAGL. We have a technique  that it's a priority 1 to name all frames. Does  this change our requirement?    DC: Will priority levels be evaluated during  cross-disability review?    JB: Yes. Comments on guidelines will be sent  to the appropriate list. Senders won't do  further advocacy or become WG participants.    5.2.2     CMN: Priority 1, applies to all media types  that are dynamic.    IJ: In the CSS spec, we have the media group  "interactive". Thus, printers don't have  to allow highlighting.    GG: Why is selection a priority 1?     CO: In visual realm, we use standard system  colors and attributes for selection.    IJ: Selection required for *all* users.    DC: Do we want to add "programmatically"  to all of these.    CO: Separate "rendering" (e.g., of focus)      from "access to" (programmatically).    GG: There are cases when you can't get  at the selection other than how it's  rendered.    DA: If you provide a selection mechanism,  user must know how it is selected.    IJ: I think highlighting is Pri 1 since  everyone in this room needs a highlighting  mechanism.    CO: Currently, there's no means in the Windows OS     to do selection (programmatically). Selection     color should be removed (or color changed) when     you switch windows.    Resolved: 5.2.2 Priority 1. If UA supports selection  mechanism. Media: all.    CO: Add to "identifying" : "through standard  interfaces where available". Worried about  wiggle room if a UA implements rendering but  not through a standard OS interface.    DA: Don't forget sound highlighting.    DC: I think wiggle room is ok.    5.2.3 Is this the same issue?     CO: Focus is more important than selection,  but should be treated the same.    CO: Editorial comment - keep wording similar  between selection and focus for all pertinent  techniques.    5.2.4     CMN: I suggest that this be moved to Pri 2,  with caveat that cognitive disability groups  might respond that this deserves Pri 1.    DC: I second this.    KH: I think there are two scenarios:    1) Moving viewport to follow focus. I think    Pri 1 to move the viewport to follow the focus.    2) Moving focus to follow the viewport. I think    Pri 2 to move the focus to follow the viewport.    This is a good feature. Should be available,    user should be able to turn on/off.    CMN: Propose Pri 2 for case 1, Pri 3 for case 2.    DC: We shouldn't be delving into User Interface     issues so much.    CO: Important to ensure that focus, selection, etc.      be in the viewport. Think that 5.2.4 should      read that the user's POR be within the viewport.    CMN: Example - using emacsspeak. Wouldn't want     it to read what's a page and a half away from     the viewport.    DC: Don't think guidelines should discuss UI.    The focus can be outside of the viewport, but if  it changes, the viewport must follow it.    WAC: If I scroll down and focus outside of  viewport, but start tabbing, should the viewport  move to the focus earlier in the document  or the focus move into the viewport?    IJ: Propose two techniques:     1) Priority 1 when focus changes, must then      be in the viewport.     2) Whether you move the viewport to meet the focus      or the focus to meet the current viewport's location      is not Priority 1.     DC: Focus and tab order could be different. If you      search text to move to a point in the text,      your focus doesn't change, but your selection      does.     IJ: Propose that when the selection changes,  it should be in the viewport afterwards.    WAC: I'm confused.    /* Ian tries to explain */    Resolved: Priority 1 when focus or selection changes,  afterward the focus or selection must be in the viewport.    WAC: Proposal: I think moving the focus to follow the  viewport should be at least a Priority 2 functionality.    CMN: Should be a togglable feature.    JG: Add a navigation command to move the focus  to the first focusable place in the viewport if  one exists.    IJ: For any "thing" you want to navigate to,  navigate to the next logical "thing" or navigate  to the next "thing" in the viewport.    CO: But how does this interact with tabindex?    IJ: Good question.    /* CMN Proposes we push this to mailing list  and move on to script navigation */    5.3    Note:  MS would like to get feedback on keyboard models.  Cf. the Web TV-style model (four buttons to  get anywhere on the page). MS also working on  keyboard navigation to non-document parts of  a UI. After the meeting, we would like to solicit  input from people interested in this.    5.3.1    JG: From last meeting, sentiment that scripts  are not inherently accessible or inaccessible.  But when a script creates a user interface,  it should follow the UA guidelines related  to interfaces.    DA: This means a script might be considered a UA.    JG: There are both device-dependent and device-independent  events (e.g., mouse-down, etc.).    /* Editor's note: sort techniques in section 5.3 */    DC: There's a difference between server-side and  client-side scripting. We're concerned about  changes to the UA output.    CMN: I have a question about triggering events.  The  device-independent part is covered by 3.1.1 (allow device  independence). I would like this group to formally take this  to the P&F WG and examine the event model and take to  HTML/DOM WGs.    JB: It's already in that WG.    DD: 5.3.1: We need to say that doing this through  an API is ok.     CO: IE currently and will in the future support 5.3.1.  User can say disable/enable/prompt before scripts  are executed.     IJ: Add "security reasons" to rationale section  about alerts before script is executed.    DD: Divide "ability to alert" from "user wants  to be alerted".    CNM: Propose to drop 5.3.1 (since, e.g., some  scripts don't cause change). Boost 5.3.2 up  in priority and say "when changes occur,  there could be accessibility problems".    CO: Let's keep 5.3.1. It's a stop-gap  (and MS already does it!) It's a useful  technique.    GG: From a usability standpoint, it's not  clear how valuable it is to know something  before every script is run. I may want  to disable or enable all scripts. But  when a change occurs, I want to know. But  impossible to know what the change is.    DA: Gregg Vanderheiden has an example of a page  with a spinning globe. If the globe is decorative,  who cares. But if it's a map with links, knowing  that and providing alternatives is crucial.    IJ and WAC talk about interdependence of  PAGL and UAGL on this issue. Not sure where  burden should fall.    DC: 5.3.2 has to be priority 2 if not level 1.    WAC: I agree with DC that 5.3.2 should be Pri 1.    WAC: Notification based on execution  and timing of execution configurable.    IJ proposes:    1) UA should allow turn on/off scripts (3.3.8)    2) Author should provide alt information for       important scripts describing what a script       will do (e.g., cost money, change environment).       Talk to PAGL WG and HTML WG about this.    3) UA must provide access to that information.    DC: Difference between notification and instant  rendering.    CO: MS is coming from a background of documents  that suddenly got behavior. Can we get a "title"  attribute on SCRIPT element?    /* "title" is not on SCRIPT element in HTML 4.0 */    CO: Lots of scripts are just useful to programmer.  In other languages, you wouldn't want this, why  for HTML.    CMN: Yes, we want document about what code does.  Specifically for embedded applets, PAGL requires  that that information be available through other  means. Also suggests that in the content of the  page, explain what important scripts will do.    DA: I only want to know about *significant*  changes. Just like a button on a user interface.    GG: There seems to be two kinds of scripts  1) One makes underlining page look smarter. You     don't care about that type of script. This type     we don't care about.    2) Another script makes the page behave in an      unexpected fashion that might cause a screen     reader to miss something. Need to provide     a description (e.g., on the status bar).    The average community is not striving for  this functionality.    KH: The UA doesn't know what a script will do.  The author knows what the script is expected  to do.    IJ: There's (unfortunately) no longdesc on SCRIPT,  which seems to be the missing piece.    DC: To provide alt content for scripts:   1) Use NOSCRIPT   2) Use "alt" with APPLET.    DD: A script can generate html that is included  in the document that explains what the script does.    IJ: Good idea.    CMN: We're not asking UA to figure out  script semantics. We're asking Authors to provide  a description.    CO: We should expect that script authors not  do unexpected things. Or we expect authors  to document them.    DD: Proposes:  1) Users must be able to turn on/off scripts (Pri 1)  2) When scripting changes the document output (which     the UA knows after the fact), the UA should alert,     through an interface, that the document has changed.     Pri 1.       CO: There is work under way in msaa to inform of changes     in document model.       DD: Also being discussed by DOM WG.       CMN: Note also that this is covered by the guideline     to use W3C specs when available/pertinent.    The rest is not up to the UA to handle.    ========    What to expect in near future:  1) No document before end of year (due to     editor commitments)  2) Will keep issues list up to date.  3) Proposals from editors will be      sent to mailing list before     being integrated into document.     [Some Subject trickery like "Proposed: ..."]    JB: I've seen other WGs do this (face-to-face     and teleconfs): issues will have been posted,     discussion on email, hammered into a proposal,     then consensus is declared and the issue     considered "closed" unless new information     is presented.    IJ: Chair is also resonsible for recording minority  opinions.    /* Lunch */    Should we allow users to navigate elements  with scripts and synthesize those events (trigger  them through other means)?    Need "onactivate". (Not in HTML 4.0).    GG: This should be a DOM issue and adaptive  technology vendor issue.    5.4.4: Navigation among elements with event  handlers.    DD: Do through the DOM (interface).    CMN: I don't think that *navigation* of these  is not priority 1 (should be pri 2). And  the triggering is covered by 3.1.1.    KH: I don't think that any of 5.4.1/2/3/4 should  be priority 1. I think navigation among  active elements is priority 1.    IJ: Pri 2 to navigate among specific classes of objects.    KH: Another concern - conformance. In IE currently,  we don't provide keyboard access to elements unless  they are links or form controls. E.g., can't  navigate to headers with associated scripts. Want  to ensure that techniques written so that missing  one functionality doesn't mean conformance broken  for three techniques.    CMN: But if you don't give access to headers  with "onmouseover", you violate more than one  technique.    WAC: Scripts are to browser what browser is to  OS (with inheritance).     CMN: Scripts need repair strategy from UA. We  would all benefit from a proper event model.    DC: I concur with my colleague from Australia  that 3.3.1 covers this whole discussion.    /* Discussion of synthesis of event triggering */    CO: Problem is not identifying the events but  identifying the keyboard model for activating them.  (Navigating from element with event to element  with event).    IJ: Not hard to insert events into the list  of things that can have focus. Then right  click to activate a particular event.    CO: In theory, not hard. But would be ugly.  I think this should be handled by P&F.    DC: I hear CO saying that if it's ugly then  we shouldn't put it in the guidelines.    CO: I *do* want to do this. It's political issue,     to. If you provide a "crutch" (for keyboard access),     the result could be lazy authors. "We don't      have to provide keyboard access since the UA does it."       JG: Proposed 5.4.4. Do we provide a repair  strategy for this case?    CO: I think the technique should be in there,  should discuss the priority.    CMN: Don't think we need a repair strategy. The  solution is ugly. The more specific we make our  solutions, the more we lock ourselves into those  solutions. My favorite 3.1.1 covers us and we  shouldn't discuss implementations. Let P&F fix  this properly. The more we specify the repair  strategy, the more we delay creating a real  solution.    WAC: If a priority 1, you would navigate to  a lot of elements that aren't really that  interesting.    DC: I read 3.1.1 to mean program commands  generated output.     JG: Leave in 5.4.4 as Priority 2 for now.    CO: Propose to move to issues list.    -----  JG: How do we deal with issues?    HB: In XML, we handled about 10 issues a week.    JB: Need to take time at end of a meeting to  summarize "where we are". Need telecons  to discuss resolutions.    CO: Need to translate issue to guideline. I think  that's the Chair's job. Prioritizing them  is another process.    /* End of meeting */

This is absolutely browser sniffing: you are giving some clients  content that others do not get (based on their known support  for @import).

      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs    attached mail follows:  My full name is : Hern?n Camilo Rocha Ni?o.    I would like to help translating this document (HTML4.0) from english into spanish.    I've live in Fort Benning (GA) and London. My current city is Bogot?, where I was born.    Thank you for the opportunity.        

      Hello,    Below I (roughly and rapidly) compare the user agent requirements of  section 508 [1] with those of UAAG 1.0 (the 23 March draft [2]).  I  think that our requirements are very similar in most cases, though  expressed differently. Two differences stand out:    1) We don't have a requirement to turn off blinking/flashing in the  UI. I note that we have explicitly chosen *not* to include this  requirement for the user interface. We discussed whether our content  requirements should be extended to the user interface in general, and  decided against this. [I don't have the URI handy for the decision  but could track it down.]    2) We don't have a requirement for consistency among images used     in the UI (though I think that checkpoint 7.3 probably covers     that).    Please note the following:     a) This is not a definitive analysis.   b) I'm not proposing any changes to UAAG 1.0.   c) I don't think we should include this type of comparison in       UAAG 1.0 because this is just one country's regulation.     - Ian    [1] http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm      Refer to "? 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems"  [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0555    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    ===================    <508>  (a) When software is designed to run on a system that has a keyboard,  product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where the  function itself or the result of performing a function can be  discerned textually.  </508>    <UAAG>  1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through  keyboard input alone. [Priority 1] Both content and user  agent.     Comment: We *always* require keyboard support.  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (b) Applications shall not disrupt or disable activated features of  other products that are identified as accessibility features, where  those features are developed and documented according to industry  standards. Applications also shall not disrupt or disable activated  features of any operating system that are identified as accessibility  features where the application programming interface for those  accessibility features has been documented by the manufacturer of the  operating system and is available to the product developer.  </508>    <UAAG>  7.1 Follow operating environment conventions that benefit  accessibility when implementing the selection, content focus, and user  interface focus. [Priority 1]    7.2 Ensure that default input configurations do not interfere with  operating environment accessibility conventions. [Priority 1]    7.3 Follow operating environment conventions that benefit  accessibility. In particular, follow conventions that benefit  accessibility for user interface design, keyboard configuration,  product installation, and documentation.    7.4 Follow operating environment conventions to indicate the input  configuration. [Priority 2]  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (c) A well-defined on-screen indication of the current focus shall be  provided that moves among interactive interface elements as the input  focus changes. The focus shall be programmatically exposed so that  assistive technology can track focus and focus changes.  <508>    <UAAG>  10.6 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the selection and content  focus. Allow the user to configure the highlight styles. The highlight  mechanism must not rely on color alone. For graphical viewports, if  the highlight mechanism involves colors or text decorations, allow the  user to choose from among the full range of colors or text decorations  supported by the operating environment. [Priority 1]     6.5 Using standard APIs, provide programmatic alert of changes to  content, user interface controls, selection, content focus, and user  interface focus. [Priority 1]  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (d) Sufficient information about a user interface element including  the identity, operation and state of the element shall be available to  assistive technology. When an image represents a program element, the  information conveyed by the image must also be available in text.  </508>    <UAAG>   6.4 Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent user  interface controls. [Priority 1]     1.2 Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification,  etc.) that is a non-text element and is part of the user agent user  interface has a text equivalent. [Priority 1]   </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (e) When bitmap images are used to identify controls, status  indicators, or other programmatic elements, the meaning assigned to  those images shall be consistent throughout an application's  performance.  </508>    <UAAG>    Comment: No corresponding requirement. However, consistency in the UI  is probably covered by checkpoint 7.3:    7.3 Follow operating environment conventions that benefit  accessibility. In particular, follow conventions that benefit  accessibility for user interface design, keyboard configuration,  product installation, and documentation. [Priority 2]  </UAAG>  ===================    <508>  (f) Textual information shall be provided through operating system  functions for displaying text. The minimum information that shall be  made available is text content, text input caret location, and text  attributes.  </508>    <UAAG>  6.6 Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the operating  environment). Where these APIs do not enable the user agent to satisfy  the requirements of this document, use the standard input and output  APIs of the operating environment. [Priority 1]    6.8 For an API implemented to satisfy requirements of this document,  support the character encodings required for that API. [Priority 1]    Comment: UAAG doesn't have any requirements related to a text input  caret. Access to all (text) content is covered by checkpoints in  Guideline 2.    </UAAG>      ===================    <508>  (g) Applications shall not override user selected contrast and color  selections and other individual display attributes.  </508>    <UAAG>  Comment: The checkpoints of Guideline 4 require configuration and  control  of color, text size, playback rates, some audio characteristics,  and some speech characteristics. UAAG does not include a general  requirement that user preferences override all author preferences  or user agent defaults.  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (h) When animation is displayed, the information shall be displayable  in at least one non-animated presentation mode at the option of the  user.  </508>    <UAAG>  Comment: This is an interesting one because it sounds like an authoring  requirement to me. Our checkpoints for control of animation  (including video, animated images, and animated text) are:  3.2, 3.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, and 4.8.  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (i) Color coding shall not be used as the only means of conveying  information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or  distinguishing a visual element.  </508>    <UAAG>  10.2 Ensure that all of the default highlight styles for the  selection, content focus, enabled elements, recently visited links,  and fee links (1) do not rely on color alone, and (2) differ from each  other, and not by color alone. [Priority 1]    10.6 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the selection and content  focus. Allow the user to configure the highlight styles. The highlight  mechanism must not rely on color alone. For graphical viewports, if  the highlight mechanism involves colors or text decorations, allow the  user to choose from among the full range of colors or text decorations  supported by the operating environment. [Priority 1]    10.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the viewport with the  current focus. For graphical viewports, the default highlight  mechanism must not rely on color alone. [Priority 1]    Comment: I also expect checkpoint 7.3 will cover other user  interface elements:     7.3 Follow operating environment conventions that benefit  accessibility. In particular, follow conventions that benefit  accessibility for user interface design, keyboard configuration,  product installation, and documentation.  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (j) When a product permits a user to adjust color and contrast  settings, a variety of color selections capable of producing a range  of contrast levels shall be provided.  </508>    <UAAG>  Comment: All of our color requirements refer to "the full range  of colors supported by the operating environment."  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (k) Software shall not use flashing or blinking text, objects, or  other elements having a flash or blink frequency greater than 2 Hz and  lower than 55 Hz.  </508>    <UAAG>  3.3 Allow configuration to render animated or blinking text as  motionless, unblinking text. [Priority 1]    Comment: We have explicitly chosen *not* to include this  requirement for the user interface. We discussed whether our  content requirements should be extended to the user interface  in general, and decided against this.  </UAAG>    ===================    <508>  (l) When electronic forms are used, the form shall allow people using  assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and  functionality required for completion and submission of the form,  including all directions and cues.  </508>    <UAAG>  2.1 For all format specifications that the user agent implements, make  content available through the rendering processes described by those  specifications. [Priority 1]     Comment: Checkpoint 2.3 is also relevant.    5.4 Allow configuration to prompt the user to confirm (or cancel) any  form submission that is not caused by an explicit user request to  activate a form submit control.  </UAAG>    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Reference document:    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990611    Based on discussions at the 17 June UAGL teleconference [1]  here is a proposed modification to the checkpoints in  Guidelines 7 (Navigation). The proposal leaves intact  checkpoints 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 which were discussed and "approved"  during the teleconference.    1) Merge 7.4 and 7.5.     Proposed text:         "Allow the user to navigate all active elements in the document."     Proposed Priority: 2.      Techniques: sequential, direct, search, etc.    2) Delete 7.6 (Allow the user to search for active elements).    3) I propose that we leave 7.7 (text search) and 7.8      (document tree navigation). However, several issues     persist about searching:       a) Do we search on the document source or rendered content?        At the teleconf, the Working Group expressed consensus that        searching should be on rendered content only (recall: rendered        does not mean only that which is in the viewport, but the        entire document as rendered).       b) Do we search on (some or all)         attribute values (or even attribute names)?         Attributes used to specify alternative content are of        particular interest.           There is a checkpoint that already ensures that UAs         provide access to this content (6.3), which I assume means        that it's somehow rendered. Which means that it would be        covered by checkpoint 7.7.          I don't see that searching on attribute names would        reduce barriers to accessibility.          I propose, therefore, not to restore a checkpoint on searching        attribute values.      Related questions:    - Should we add a checkpoint about navigating all elements?    Some thoughts:       a) This may not be necessary since Checkpoint 7.8         (document tree navigation) would allow this.           ISSUE: We talk about navigating the document tree               which I assume means the source tree. However,               we talk about searching the rendering structure.               The rendering structure may not be "tree-shaped"               and contains information that may not come from the               source tree (e.g., content generated by style sheets,               numbers in numbered lists, etc.).  What exactly               do we mean by navigating the document tree?      b) Navigating all elements feels like a technique to me (for       accessing/skipping information more quickly). I could imagine       two (Pri 3) checkpoints for dependent user agents:         i) Allow users to navigate elements in a document.          ii) Allow users to configure which element types they wish to          navigate. This already exists as checkpoint 2.4 and is meant          to apply to all navigation checkpoints. However, it's utility          would be made more evident with a general checkpoint about          navigating elements.      c) Why sequential navigation of all elements and not direct       navigation? Is sequential navigation of all elements more  beneficial       (or just more prevalent/easier to implement/)?           - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0205.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

We couldn't very well do it without. The point is that going in-process in our case is a kind of security-hole in the MS windows system (certainly for NT). Microsoft is discouraging this way of working en looks for ways to solve this security-hole. The main reason is that MS software (including the OS) crashes because of this kind of practice.

If it is the consensus of this working group that we mention this as a useful technique (in the techniques document), than that is oke with me. For myself, I would like a secure solution.

      Hello,    Checkpoint 7.5 in Determining Conformance to UAAG 1.0 [1]  reads:        Allow the user to search for rendered text content,      including rendered text equivalents.

      Hello again,    To close this thread: during today's teleconference, I  called Arnaud to find out (I hope definitively) whether style  information is available through other means. He responded yes,  that you can query a node to find out whether it has a style  attribute and then access the value of the attribute as text.  Therefore, the style information is available (though in an  unstructured manner) through the core interfaces. Refer to the  minutes of today's meeting [1] for further discussion.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0125.html      Ian Jacobs wrote:  >   > Hello,  >   > Since I'm not a DOM expert, I asked Arnaud LeHors  > (former Team contact for DOM WG and present DOM WG participant  > and resident DOM guru...) whether the entire DOM Level 2 Style  > Specification (chapters 1 and 2) would be required to provide  > access to style sheets in an HTML or XML document.

JG: In 31 March draft, there are  three checkpoints + turn on/off.    JG Summary of issues:    a) Device independent triggering of events? (Event synthesis).    b) Navigation to elements with explicit event handlers?    DA: Navigation to elements with event handlers shouldn't      be priority 1.    JG: I don't think we should include elements with event handlers      in set of active elements. Many events are "superfluous" or      decorative. Complicated issues being dealt with by WAI PF      Working Groups (e.g., event synthesis) for future specs.      One important issue is to describe the purpose of the event:      is it eye candy only or essential for access to page information?    DA: For Web pages as interfaces, page inaccessible if you can't      activate in a device-independent manner.    DA: Would a "mouse-over" be generated when the user tabs to the      element?    MN: We're running into trying to solve problems we don't understand      well. Should we just push this to techniques?    DA: Until we can tell whether an event handler is important, we      shouldn't limit access to it.    CMN: Anything with an event handler is an active element. The UA      could also provide configurability about what should be      included in active elements (e.g., P3 checkpoint). User could      choose to include/exclude event handlers.    DA: Does "active" also mean "takes focus"?    CMN: That's an implementation issue. In IE, in order to specify event       handlers, you need to use certain types of elements. This is an IE       peculiarity. I think "active elements" must be able to take       focus, but things that take focus don't limit the set of        active elements.    IJ: I like Charles' suggestion to allow configurability.    PROPOSED: Allow users to configure user agents            to say what elements will be            considered active elements. (P3)    /* Editors note: In this case, revise active element definition */    Mark: I like the idea, but I don't want to differ too much from        current practice.    IJ: Might define active element with some user agent-dependent piece  (e.g., links, controls, maybe other elements).    CMN: My proposal does not really move away from current practice. I  think  it's a more accurate description of the principle.    IJ: Why not generalize to allowing the UA to allow the user      to configure any elements that are available in sequential      navigation....    Mark: My concern is defining active elements w.r.t. current practice.        Otherwise, including them in the list        of active elements seems ok.    CMN: I don't think we should limit to explicitly associated event       handlers. If you allow configurabilty, you address bubbling, etc.       You can give users access to all elements and synthesize the       events. You *have* to give access, in short.       I agree that in a lot of cases, you want to skip them.       You'd probably have to adjust settings after viewing a portion       of the document (to see how it works). The UI can be simple (it       doesn't have to be technical). Configurability is an improvement       on the first requirement: get to everything. Configuration       can be as sophisticated as you want (reg exps!).    JG: I don't trust that people will be able to make configuration       decisions.     /* CMN leaves */    HB: In HTML 4.0, almost all elements can have associated event      handlers.     CW: I think it's reasonable to have two checkpoints.    JG: Several browsers already have sequential access. We'd be asking      them to do something different.     Mark: The document is out of date, it's hard to remember what's      in there. I'm torn: (a) yes to access to everything (b)      pain to navigate through long lists (c) programmatic nightmare      For (c), the list of event handlers may be generated dynamically.    DA: I think "active elements" must include event handlers (P1). But      have another checkpoint to navigate elements with explicitly      associated scripts (P2).    HB: Users don't know a priori which elements have associated      scripts. Also, scripts may be associated, but not have      an impact.    JG: Right, you don't know what the "purpose" of the script is.    JG: What about event synthesis?    IJ: Should this be part of another checkpoint? (the one in the      guideline about device-independence).    JG: I think we need to say it straight to readers.    Mark: Jaws, for example, simulates mouse events. I don't think     it needs to be stated explicitly, but I have no problem with     a separate checkpoint.    IJ: I would rather include in single checkpoint.    Chris: How much will access to event handlers help the       average user. We should mention something in the      Techniques about appropriateness of information.    IJ: I don't think there's consensus about whether we      need a separate checkpoint for navigation to      elements with associated scripts.    AD: Too much information (e.g., by including event      handler information) can be difficult for those      with cognitive disabilities.    NEXT MEETING 2 June.    Regrets: Ian

I don't think  that the WCAG says that frames are inaccessible (though  they may not be a good idea). Authors need to make them  accessible by providing alternatives that don't rely  on 2-dimensional layout, etc. And user agents needs to give  access to frames in a serial manner for those without  graphical displays.    > > > - Guideline 9.2: I don't get this.

IJ2: Up to now, techniques have not undergone explicit WG review before  being included in the techniques document. I don't disagree with a  policy where the WG would approve techniques before they are added,  but we don't have such a policy today.     I marked it as "needs work" not because it's any less ripe than other  techniques, but because the ideas themselves are in discussion and  I wanted to mark for myself that we needed to continue to develop  these ideas.  I did not want to use the issues list before going to  CR.     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Chair: Gregg Vanderheiden         Chuck Letourneau  Scribe: Ian Jacobs    Present:  Wendy Chisholm  Jason White  Charles McCathieNevile  Gregg Vanderheiden  Eric Hansen    [Agenda]    ADDED ISSUE:  CHARLES: What about mixed-case problems? Difficult for  some users to process. Should this be a technique?  Don't encode information in all-caps only.    GV: Device-independence issues.    IJ: Case not well-defined for all languages.    NO RESOLUTION.    Issue 1.) Bug-8.  Note that is recently underwent a revision and  therefore might be expected to require some editing. As noted, the  reference to "synthesized speech" as requiring a "text equivalent"  would not be comprehensible without further explanation.    RESOLVED: Delete reference to synthesized speech.    /* Eric Hansen joined here */    Issue 2.) Bug-9.  Checkpoint 14.2 mistakenly makes reference to  equivalents "to text".  [Provide visual or auditory equivalents to  text where they facilitate comprehension of the page.]    RESOLVED: Edit the checkpoint to read, "Supplement text  with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate  comprehension of a page."    ALSO RESOLVED: Remove note about helping non-readers - it's too  simplistic to try to communicate through symbols only. Remove  the Note and discuss it in Techniques.    Issue 3.)  Bug-10. The possibility of synchronizing text equivalents  for video was not acknowledged in checkpoint 1.3 [For each movie,  provide an auditory description of the video track and synchronize it  with the audio track.]    Proposed resolution: This idea is in checkpoint 1.4 [For any  time-based presentation (e.g., a movie, animation, or multimedia  presentation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or  video descriptions) with the presentation.]  However, since it seems  completely redundant with a portion of 1.4 have we left out an idea or  has 1.3 been misrepresented?  The editors will compare an older  version with the latest and if nothing has been left out, delete this  checkpoint.  Otherwise, bring a new proposal for the wording of 1.3 to  the group on Thursday.    1.3 is about providing a description.  1.4 is about synchronization.  RESOLVED:   a) Edit 1.3 to make synchronization parenthetical   b) Change wording of 1.4 to "equivalent alternatives must be  synchronized"    PROPOSED: Until most video player technologies can generate an audio  description of the video track from a text equivalent (see  checkpoint 1.1), provide an auditory description of the video track]  (synchronized with the audio track as per [#Tsynchronize-equivalents])    Issue 4.) Bug-11. The word "visual" is used to describe non-text  elements, even though text is usually rendered in a visual manner.    Proposed resolution: The editors will reread the document to ensure  that visual is use appropriately, especially in regards to presenting  text.  If something earth shattering is revealed, the editors will  bring it to the discussion on Thursday.    ACTION Editors: review the document for this.    Issue 5.  Bug-12. The need for text equivalents for ASCII art was  cited in two checkpoints (1.1 and 1.5). [1.1 - Provide a text  equivalent for every non-text element.  1.5 - Replace ASCII art with  an image or explain it.]    Proposed resolution: Delete checkpoint 1.5.    Jason: Sufficiently rare that doesn't warrent a checkpoint.  Put it in techniques document.    RESOLVED:    a) Delete checkpoint 1.5.    b) Discuss equivalents for ascii art in techniques docuemnt    c) Put link to glossary example in 13.10    Issue 6.  Bug-13. The description of the relationship between the  terms "assistive technology", "screen reader", and "user agent"  is not consistent throughout the document.    Proposed resolution: The editors will reread the document to ensure  that these terms are used consistently.  If something earth  shattering is revealed, the editors will bring it to the  discussion on Thursday.    ACTION Editors: review the document for this.    Issue 7.  Bug-14. The guidelines document does not claim  a conformance level.    Proposed resolution: Add the following statement at the end of the  Conformance section, "The <a href="#claim">conformance claim for this  document</a> is located at the end of the document."    RESOLVED:   a) Make this document Triple-A compliant (Yikes!)   b) Use the icon (if availble).    Proposal: Say "do not" instead of "avoid"  --------  GV: "avoid" conveys meaning that there is an alternative.      "do not use" does not.    EH: But "avoid" also implies "discretion". I tried to but      I couldn't.    Examine each case:     1) Avoid using tables for layout.   2) Avoid causing the screen to flicker.   3) Avoid causing content to blink.   4) Avoid movement in pages.   5) Do not cause pop-ups or other windows.   6) Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies.      NO RESOLUTION.      ISSUE: PRIORITY 2 for all tables for layout? (checkpoint 5.3)    IJ: W3C Home page works fine. Why priority 2 if my table      degrades gracefully?  GV: If we have a table linearizer, would this drop to Priority 3?  WC: You could use frames (but this is probably more troublesome      than tables).    Proposed: Do not use tables for layout unless they            render logically when table markup is ignored.    Wendy: The GL used to say 'If you can't use style sheets,  it's ok to use tables "until supported"'.    10.3 is problematic as well. It's not about "rendering".  It's about getting at data cell-by-cell (e.g., navigation).    JW: Cell-by-cell navigation is still a significant nuisance -  understanding the logical order of a document.    JW: If you don't use tables but you do use style sheets,  other elements (e.g., P) will be used properly. Otherwise,  if tables are used, TH is abused.    JW: Don't like confusing structure with tables for layout.    CMN: There are abuses that don't compromise accessibility. But     that doesn't mean we shouldn't care.    PROPOSED: Priority 1:        Any table used for layout must make sense when        table markup is ignored.      Make clear in note that this is an abuse of tables.    JW: If same markup is used for layout as for tabular information,  and can't be automatically distinguished, user must go through  manipulations to figure it out.    ACTION Ian: send proposal to list.

What is the advantage of freezing a frame?    It sounds like there are a couple of requirements:  1) Stop things from moving  2) Stop things from being too busy (e.g., don't open     too many viewports).    But is "don't render content" a requirement? If so, then  why (still) video content and not graphically rendered  text? Or graphics? I don't think we have a requirement  for "make this page less busy" - the closest we get is  "don't open too many viewports".     So what are the accessibility requirements surrounding  video and animation that freezing does not address?     - Ian    > At 10:33 PM 6/9/00 -0400, Ian Jacobs wrote:  > >Hello,  > >  > >Please consider the following editorial clarification to  > >checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 (of the 7 May draft [1]):  > >  > >  3.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video.  > >      [Priority 1]  > >  > >  3.5 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or  > >      blinking text.

IJ: Checkpoint 2.6 is referenced by 2.5, 4.4, and 4.5, so the WG  decided to make it its own checkpoint at the November  face-to-face meeting at AOL [2]. The configuration requirement of  2.5 is stronger than 2.3 (since it requires the UA to render  everything at once, so, for example, the query technique doesn't  satisfy 2.5).

Is the  > ability to force content update to occur in the same viewport  > implied? (seems to be to me, but should be clearer please)     IJ: I think that if the user refuses, then the viewport doesn't open.  I don't think there's any need to have a requirement to force  content update since the user can always do an HTTP GET.    > 6.5 why different wording style from 6.{3,4}?    IJ: This was actually a conscious decision by me. The length of the  list in 6.5 ("content, user interface controls, selection,  content focus, and user interface focus") made the following  formulation awkward:       "6.5 Provide programmatic alert of changes to content, user     interface controls, selection, content focus, and user     interface focus using standard APIs."    I tried 6.3 and 6.4 using the current 6.5 structure, but decided  against. The current 6.3 and 6.4 "front load" better.    > 11.1 and 11.2 content labels mean that it is possible to get to  > level A without letting the user know how to use keyboard control  > of content :(    IJ: I am not sure what you mean by "content labels" here. Do you mean  "priorities"? If so, I note that you already have an objection to  the priority of checkpoint 11.2 (which I forwarded in the last  call [3]).    [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0014     > 11.4 tighten up conformance requirement ('most' is a bit vague,  > but it is even so only in informative note...)    IJ: The informative Note is there to encourage more than the minimal  requirement of the checkpoint, which seems pretty clear:       "For each functionality in the set required by checkpoint 11.5,    allow the user to configure a single-key binding (i.e., one key    press performs the task, with zero modifier keys). If the    number of physical keys on the keyboard is less than the number    of functionalities required by by checkpoint 11.5, allow    single-key bindings for as many of those functionalities as    possible."     > 12.1 "ensure the documentation is available in at least one form  > that..." to distinguish between having WCAG-AA doc for myBrowser  > 4.0 but not version 5.0...    IJ: I can change "product" to "user agent". Then, that would be more  consistent with this statement from the beginning of section 2:       "The statement of the checkpoint is one or more requirements     that must be satisfied by the user agent (i.e., the "subject     of the claim) for the purposes of conformance. The "user     agent" may consist of more than one software component, as     explained in the section on well-formed conformance claims."    Since the conformance claim must be about a specific version of  the product, you wouldn't be able to "get away" with a version of  the documentation for a different user agent.     > 3.1 conformance requirements come from checkpoints, plus claiming  > conformance according to this section. (Explicitly?)    IJ: I don't find "according to this section" in 3.1.

Good question. What do we do, for example, for XML applications.  One goal of this checkpoint is to find links based on the value  of the "title" attribute (e.g., when IMGs are in links).     ISSUE to discuss during a teleconf.    > 5.3.4, Allow the user to move the focus to a link based on its integer(  > tabbing-order) position  >   > -if I understand what this is allowing the user to do, I don't think we need  > this to be a priority #1, given the navigation and searching impiled in  > 5.3.1 thru 5.3.3    I agree. You can get to the link by tabbing. Direct navigation is  convenient, but the document is not inaccessible without it.

This is a very good question, and one I've been struggling with.  I've been trying to think of checkpoints in a way that doesn't  necessitate having a table selection mechanism. For instance,  if you can navigate to a table, the selection mechanism is implied.  However, navigation among tables is not likely to survive as  a checkpoint, so I agree that there probably needs to be a checkpoint  about selecting a table.    The selection might be the mechanism used to indicate which table  has been selected, but the table identification mechanism is  probably independent of it. I think we shouldn't use focus  if it's implied that focus is for element activation.    I think this question also applies to table cells and forms.    Links and form controls are covered by the focus.    Note that such checkpoints used to be in the document.  See http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981112/       [Technique: 5.5.3] [Priority 1]           Provide a mechanism for designating the current table of a  document.

      Hello,    Here are a few discussion topics for our joint meeting with  the DOM WG tentatively scheduled for 2 March at 12pm followed  by lunch (in Cambridge, as part of the Plenary week):    1) API access to the rendering structure (this is apparently     a dead-end, meaning the DOM WG is not going in this direction).    2) API access to the user's style sheet/run-time style    3) Device-independent events. What is the status of WAI PF's     work in this area?    4) Exposing focus and selection through an API.    5) Identifying accessibility features in the DOM specs themselves.     What are these features?     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The WG explicitly chose level double-A for this checkpoint (rather  than single-A and rather than a relative priority) because it was  considered very important that the user be able to overcome all  difficult and impossible barriers to using the UA's documentation.    WCAG doesn't specify what level of conformance is best for what  situations. The UA Working Group decided that Double-A was a  P1 requirement for conformance user agent documentation  We recognize that this is "skewed" in the sense that the mapping  is not single-to-single, double-to-double, etc. This was a conscious  decision of the WG.     _ Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      WAI UAGL Teleconference  20 January 1999    Participants:    Jon Gunderson  Ian Jacobs  Denis Anson  Gregory Rosmaita  Kitch Barnicle  Harvey Bingham  David Poehlman  Dick Brown (half the call)  Mickey Quezner    Regrets:  Rich Schwertdfeger  Charles McCathieNevile  Jim Allan    NEXT MEETING: 27 January 2000 @2pm ET    Agenda [1]  [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0129.html    RESOLVED: The Working Group agrees to move to Candidate Recommendation            based on the resolutions below.                The WG agrees to let Jon, Ian, and Judy do scheduling of the            CR period. We will inform the WG.       1.WD#185: clarification of "single key" access        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#185        Refer to proposal by Ian     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0151.html       KB: Do we need the first checkpoint of two? What would go under          that one?        JG: Things like moving keys closer together, using mnemonic         commands, etc.       DA: In the second proposed checkpoint, change "frequently used         commands" to those preferred by the user as frequently used.       KB: How will vendors verify satisfaction? You're basically          requiring access to most commands since "frequently" is not         well-defined.       JG: Refer to unix resources files for how key access specified.       DP: Put key bindings in a profile.         Resolved: Ian's proposal accepted.       Action Ian: Incorporate changes.       2.LC#142: Checkpoint 1.5 (output device-independence) needs  clarification.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#142        Refer to Ian's proposal     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0146.html       IJ: What does it mean to inform the user of content changes through         the user interface? Also, what does it mean to inform the         user of user interface changes through the UI?       DA: What about author-initiated (e.g., through scripts).            Recall that one of the issues had to so with changes due to         scripts that happen in a separate viewport.       GR: Add to list of useful information about a link: following the         link will open a new window.       DA: If you just notify the AT, the user doesn't know that he or         she should ask for that control.       DB: What kind of changes to content are we talking about?           GR: Content changes that occur without user intervention:         scripts, refreshes, etc.       DB: I think a lot of responsibility here belongs to the author.         The author should author, for example, so that the user         gets a message about the changes.       JG: Even if changes are announced, the user will have to explore         the document/user agent to find out what the changes were.       IJ: Consider the example of the MS home page; you tab to links         and a popup menu appears.       JG: Note that notification to ATs is required by another         checkpoint.       Proposed: Delete 9.1       Proposed: Change priority of 3.9 to P2 and downgrade 9.1               to P3.       MQ: I don't want to rush things to get the document done...        IJ: I think we are rushing it.        GR: 9.1 has, and 3.9 doesn't, alerting the user to changes.       Resolved:       - Delete 9.1       - Raise priority of 3.9 to P2.       HB: "Redundant" is not printer and screen, but different         modalities.       Action Ian: Incorporate changes.       3.LC#136: Proposal for checklist delivery (part of conformance)       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#136        Refer to HB's comments     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0138.html       Action IJ: Ensure that the link to the conformance explanation                is dated. Propose as a note to handle this.       DA: There is precedent for this.       4.LC#126: Proposed change in wording to 5.5 Provide programmatic               notification of changes to content and user                interface controls (including selection and               focus).       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#126       Resolved:       - No changes to current wording       - Use Ian's comments in techniques:          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0094.html         DA: Also, document what event notifications are made available             through APIs.       Action Ian: Edit techniques.       5.LC#127: How to verify 5.7 (Provide programmatic exchange of               information in a timely manner.)?        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#127         Refer to JG's proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0136.html            Resolved:       - No change, discuss in techniques (which need work)       - Add statement about synchronization between user actions with         the AT and what's going on in the general purpose UA. If you         are forced to way an extra 20 seconds, totally disorienting.       Action Ian: Add a statement about orientation.       6.WD#180: 10.8 should be priority 2        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#180        JG: Lack of specificity (minimal requirement) concerns me and I         don't want to raise the priority in that case.       Resolved:       - Leave checkpoint 10.8 a P3 until we have a more specific         proposal.       7.WD#181: Request for a wrapper note designed for AT developers               explaining relation to guidelines        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#181        Resolved:          - This is not an issue to hold up CR.         - This work is being carried out in the EO WG.         8.WD#178: In 10.1 and 10.2 what does communicate through an API mean        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#178         Refer to JG's proposal.      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0093.html        JG: If you can't change the input config, the documentation          suffices. Also, the API requirement is covered by 5.2 in          conjunction with the 10.1 and 10.2 (actually, 10.3)           requirement to make info to the user through the user          interface.        Resolved: Remove "and through an API" from 10.1 and 10.3.        Action Ian: Edit the checkpoints accordingly.       9.WD#177: User control of current focus change and notification.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#177         Refer to Ian's proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0147.html             Requirements:        - Content + UI        IJ: Can we be more specific about "interference"?        GR: My main concern is focus.        DP: I want "flag me" but "don't require action"          IJ: Is it only a focus issue? Spawned windows are annoying          and may cause problems for users with cognitive disabilities.          Might be a problem for motor disabilities moving windows out          of the way.        GR: You need an alert mechanism in order to know that a new          window has appeared.        Resolved:         - Use old 4.15 but add prompts, messages, other windows.       - Add a checkpoint to ensure user control of focus         changes. P2.        DP: Move some of my 1.5 techniques to new checkpoints.        Action IJ: Make changes and add techniques from GR and DP.      10.WD#188: Add definition of disability? (to CG)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#188           JG: This was sent to the WAI CG and copied to all the WGs. The UA         WG on its own is not required to add a definition. This should         be added later if the CG creates a definition or document.        Resolved: No change in the Guidelines.      11.LC#112: Split checkpoint 10.1 into two separate checkpoints for  author               and user agent input functionalities and mark as                an issue during last call.       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#112         Refer to JG proposal:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0145.html        JG: Last call reviewers:               Liam Quinn : Leave as is with current priorities.             Jon Gardner: Merge, leave as P2             Eric Hansen: IJ thinks he said merge; don't recall priority.             Martin Duerst: Author specified at least as important                            as user specified.        GR: I object to the proposal. Keyboard is vital to access today.          I've proposed a number of techniques.        How many people agree: DA, JG, DP, HB, KB      How many people object: GR, IJ, MQ        Resolved:           - JG's proposal is accepted.         - Objection from IJ, GR, MQ will be documented and delivered           with the CR.        GR: The WAI PF is dealing with this issue.

That's not my reading of the spec:    "name: This attribute assigns a name to the image map          defined by a MAP element."    One use of this name value is to be the value of the  usemap attribute on another element. But name may serve  other purposes (e.g., it could be used in scripting).    I don't see a contradiction. "Usemap" is one consumer  of MAP/name.    > 2. The document also says that  >   > "Block-level content.

Again, I don't see a contradiction. But it might be little clearer:  If your A elements are associated with an image, then specify  the geometric reasons. Authors aren't required to put in geometries.  Most of this section is about image maps, so the language is  tailored towards that application of MAP, AREA, and A.   But, the following sentence clearly indicates that an image  is not required:      "The MAP element may be used without an associated image for     general navigation mechanisms."     - Ian    > Or is it a mistaken belief that <MAP> can be used solely for the purpose of   > grouping links?  >   > Thanks much in advance.  >   > Len  >   >   >   >   >   >   >       --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

For instance, the  author states that A is a text equivalent for B. Or that  some text is an accurate summary of a table. The fact  that this information is determined by the author determines  in part the limits of responsibility for the author and  the user agent. So UAs don't have to identify a piece  of prose as a description of an image unless the author  has marked it up as such.     As to the "moral" side of judging what's best for a user,  I don't quite agree with you. I think that authors always  make judgments about what to present to the user. I have  to decide what photos are suitable for public viewing,  what products will sell the most, what type of information  users will want. I think it's easy to make mistakes  in those types of judgments (e.g., I could get it wrong  that people don't need a blurb about W3C on the home page  and that a link to another page is sufficient). And we  need to educate authors that they are wrong if they assume  that users with disabilities don't need or want some types  of information.     I was talking to someone about making a Web site about  automobiles accessible and they answered "But blind people  don't drive". Not only did they only think of blindness  when I said disability, they assumed that the only people  visiting the site would be potential drivers, clearly  a mistaken judgment.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The list of functionalities one must be able to activate with  a single command includes adding a page to one's favorites. But  the UA Guideilnes does not require that the UA implement  a favorites mechanism. If we require a binding to a function  then that implies that we also are requiring the function.  Unless the applicability clause is invoked. And that has not  been made clear.    Therefore, choose one of the following:  1) Add a requirement to have a favorites functionality.  2) Remove the functionalities related to favorites from the     list of required bindings.  3) Indicate clearly that some of the bindings only apply if     the feature has been implemented (e.g., history mechanism,     favorites, mechanism, etc.). Also indicate that some of      the bindings are for functionalities that are required by     the UA Guidelines (e.g., navigation to active elements).     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    This week, I had the good fortune of evaluating the UA Guidelines  7 July draft [1] with Tantek ?elik, who is the lead developer  for Microsoft's MAC IE 5.0 [2]. The evaluation was very useful for  a number of reasons:     - for getting feedback on the increased  precision of the checkpoints   - for making suggestions about features that could be added to MAC IE 5   - for identifying ambiguities or bugs in the spec.    We have finished 7 of 11 guidelines, and I hope we'll complete the  evaluation of the rest very soon. The results will appear in the next  implementation report.    Below, I summarize the seven issues that were raised.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000707  [2] http://www.microsoft.com/mac/ie/    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783      ISSUES    Issue 1) Is the UA responsible for control of timed presentations  created            by scripts?       Checkpoint 2.2: For a presentation that requires user input within a      specified time interval, allow the user to configure the     user agent to pause the presentation automatically and await user  input      before proceeding.        Ambiguity: There was some confusion as to whether the word  "presentation"     included timed user interface behavior (e.g., a menu that closes  after, say,     5 seconds if the user has not activated a menu entry). To address  this, we     should have a definition of "presentation". I think this fits into  our     discussion of multimedia terms (refer to issue 289).          Issue: Should the user agent be responsible for timed content changes     that are due to scripts (e.g., a script causes some piece of active      content to appear for 5 seconds then disappear)? My opinion is that     scripts do not apply here. There is no way for the UA to know what  each     script will do a priori. We do require that the UA allow the user to  turn     of scripts. But this seems to be more of an authoring problem      (and this is the same issue I think for even handlers - the UA      doesn't know what they will do).        No change may be required for the checkpoint, however, since the UA  is     not required to satisfy the checkpoints in cases when it cannot  recognize     the timing effect (this is part of applicability). It may be  worthwhile to     add a note about scripts after the checkpoint.    Issue 2) Native support      The definition of "native support" begins:            A user agent supports a feature natively if it does not require           another piece of software (e.g., plug-in or external  program)           for support.       Question: The line between native support and optional modules may be     blurry at times. Suppose that the MAC IE developers make available      updates on the MAC IE home page [2] and allow users to update their      browsers from the Web. Strictly speaking, this support would not      be considered native since it required an extra download. However,     since the browser builds in (or could build in) an option to select     from available upgrades and install them automatically, it seemed  like     it was "almost" native support - this would be little different from     being able to install plug-ins available on a CD-ROM but not  installed     by default.        I think the WG should discuss the topic of the availability of  upgrades     and the relationship to native support.    Issue 3) Repair functionalities required?       Question: The UA Guidelines requires conformance to specifications.  However,     it also requires in checkpoint 2.5 a repair functionality that is not  part     of conformance to a specification:          2.5 For non-text content that has no recognized text equivalent,        generate a text equivalent from other author-supplied content.        If the non-text content is included by URI reference, base the         text equivalent on the URI reference and the content type of         the resource.       This document is asking the UA to repair broken markup, but the HTML      specification doesn't require this. Although I doubt that there's     much of an interoperability issue here, the question is pertinent:      if we ask UAs to do things but don't provide a standard for doing      so, we threaten interoperability.          So the question is: should we require this repair functionality?      What do we tell browser developers who ask "Where does it say in     the markup language specification how to do this?"     Issue 4) Proposed to add "control" to checkpoints 4.2 (font family),     and 4.3/4.4 (colors). You may need to override the color of a  specific     element, for example.    Issue 5) Style v. content and background sounds.       [Note: I believe Eric has already raised this point a number of  times.]     Question: Some content is only meant to decorate. This includes  simple     graphics, colors, animations, and sounds (namely background sounds).     We require the UA to allow the user to control the volume, speed, and     other aspects of animations and sounds. But it seems like this is  overkill     for visual or sound content that is only meant for decoration.          The author is required by WCAG 1.0 to include text equivalents     for every non-text. It may be a bug in WCAG 1.0, but I don't think  this     should be required for non-text content that is only used for  decoration.     We don't require a text equivalent for the fact that the background  color     of a page is pale yellow. Should we require a text equivalent for     a background sound that adds to the browsing experience but is only      *background sound*, i.e., decoration?       At the 29 June teleconference [3], we discussed the fact that  "background     audio" means audio that starts automatically on load. I would like to  now     argue instead (or perhaps in addition, but I don't think that on-load  is     a key characteristic) that background audio means audio that only  serves     a decorative function.       [3]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0532.html          So the question is: in the UA Guideilnes, we should require control  of     audio and animation that act as content, not as decoration. The  problem     is how to recognize the difference - I don't know how the UA would be     able to tell the difference. This is a very strong argument, in my  opinion,     for using style sheets to achieve these effects, since then the user     agent really does know that the effect is stylistic only.        Therefore I propose the following:        - For checkpoints that require configuration to not render  animations          (3.3 and 3.4) that the checkpoint apply to all animations. This          will be easier for developers, I believe, and no distinction is          between decoration and content is required at this level since  the          control pertains to movement.          - For global audio control (4.8), I think this applies to all  audio          content.          - For checkpoints that require control of animations and audio          (4.5, 4.6) we should reduce the scope for those animations and          audio that are not meant for style. In the techniques document          we would indicate that style sheets and known markup to cause          background images (that could be aniamted) and background sounds          do not require start / stop, etc. control.    Issue 6) Navigation of active elements.       Question: HTML specifies a "tabindex" attribute so that authors may     identity the sequential navigation order of certain elements. If a     user agent supports tabindex 100%, does this establish the set of     elements that are considered active for HTML? (refer to definition     of active element and checkpoint 7.3 and 7.4). The definition of  active     element reads:         "In HTML 4.01 [HTML4] documents, for example, active elements         include links, image maps, form controls, element instances         with a value for the "longdesc" attribute, and element         instances with scripts (event handlers) explicitly associated         with them (e.g., through the various "on" attributes)."       (MAC IE 5 does not allow navigation of elements with event handlers      attached., but does for other elements.)       Similarly, checkpoint 1.4 requires device-independent      activation of elements with event handlers attached:            1.4 Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements          in a device-independent manner.       The question of repair functionality is also raised again:     is the user agent required to allow keyboard activation of an     event handler specified by the author to be for the mouse?        I don't have a proposal for addressing the issue of navigation to     and activation of elements that have scripts attached (and all this     in a device-independent manner).          IMPORTANT: We also need to clarify that a some elements may not      be active at all times. For instance, if support for scripts is  turned     off, then event handlers are useless and navigation to them should  not     be required. Similarly, the "disabled" attribute in HTML 4 (which may     be toggled through scripting) specifies that an otherwise active     element is not currently active.    Issue 7) Important elements (checkpoint 7.6).        Proposal: In the techniques document, I propose that we list for HTML,    SMIL, and other languages what we consider the important elements to    be. If the list is "normative", then it needs to go in the Guidelines    document. And then there's a editorial question of how to include a  long    list of elements in the guidelines...

      22 March 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Agenda announcement:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0485    Reference document 19 March 2001 Guidelines:   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010319    Minutes of previous meeting 15 March:   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0427    Next meeting: 29 March teleconference:    Present:    Ian Jacobs (chair, scribe), Mickey Quenzer, Jon Gunderson,   David Poehlman, Gregory Rosmaita, Tim Lacy, Eric Hansen,    Charles McCathieNevile    Absent: Aaron Leventhal, Harvey Bingham, Denis Anson    Regrets: Jim Allan, Rich Schwerdtfeger    -------------  Announcements  -------------    TL, IJ: I'll be attending WWW10 in Hong Kong.    IJ: I'm visiting Netscape 27 March. Intend to visit Microsoft and      RealNetworks in April as well (all about UAAG).    ------  AGENDA  ------    a) Proposal to clarify checkpoint 2.9      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0453    IJ: Note that, e.g., 3.7 is an important special case of 2.9.  But remember that 3.7 is about disorienting visual imagery, not  access to conditional content. You could satisfy 2.9 at the same  time as 3.7 by rendering "alt" instead of images.    IJ: I think that the solution of rendering alt instead of any images  is one solution to satisfying 2.3. Maybe some clarification is  required because when you satisfy through query, element-level control  is clear. Less clear when the global replacement solution is taken.    EH: I think it needs to be made clearer: depending on which option you  choose, the requirments change slightly.    IJ: I'm not sure that query mechanism works for 2.9. In the case  of specs where conditional content rendering is fully described, 2.9  still says "let me do the rendering globally, automatically."    CMN: WAI PF is starting to look at the question of expected renderings  of features. What we want is a functional rendering configuration.    IJ: I think there are some conditions that can't be simulated.    IJ: I think 2.9 looks like 2.3, but differences are:      - Global effect (not element-level control).    - Automatic    JG: It seems like 2.9 only applies in the query case.    IJ: Except that element-level control is possible to meet 2.3 and  that wouldn't work for 2.3.    Resolved:     - We agree that 2.9 is about automatic rendering, and applies     to all conditional content (element-level control is not required).    Action IJ: In next draft, clarify the relationship between 2.3 and 2.9.    b) I'd like to get confirmation of changes to the speech    characteristic checkpoints of the 19 March 2001 draft    (as announced:    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0472)      /* Editorial note to Ian: 4.14 needs editorial fix, two notes need       to be one */      EH: The minimal requirement for 4.13 is not clear.      IJ: What piece is missing?      JG: 4.14 and 4.15 are about specific capabilities. These may not        exist in 4.13.      IJ: This needs to be made clearer: 4.14 is like 4.13 but imposes    particular characteristics. Your speech synthesizer has to support    these characteristics.      JG: The preset voices may be a way to change these parameters. Leave    the note.      Action IJ: Add "accent" to the list of "gender" and "age".      EH: Shouldn't the Note of 4.13 also include "pitch range" and    other more specific characteristics.      MQ: Some of the terms we use here (e.g., richness) I've not seen    defined in any synthesizer.      IJ: That's why we point to CSS2 for the description.      GR: Speech synthesizers do have a concept of richness. E.g.,     DoubleTalk LT has richness settings (e.g., echo chamber).       JG: I think the DecTalk also supports that parameter.      MQ: I think we need stronger definition of "richness".      CMN: I share Mickey's concern. It would be nice to copy the        glossary reference into our own glossary.      IJ: Three questions:     a) Do CSS2 terms meet our needs?         IJ: I note that CSS2 is a W3C Recommendation, which is a strong            stamp of approval.     b) How normative are they?     c) Editorial: Should we copy the terms in UAAG 1.0.      JG: From the Cambridge face-to-face, it was clear that one reason    we have 4.14 and 4.15 is for support for a system like CSS2. These    checkpoints are for designers choosing which speech technology to    include in their product. I don't think we need to do more to     define "richness".      GR: There is such a diversity of names among speech synthesizers,    I think it's valuable to use a common term such as "richness", which    is defined in CSS2.      Resolved:        - Use the CSS2 definitions as normative definitions.      - Include definitions in the UAAG 1.0 Glossary.    c) Checkpoint 9.1: Delete sentence about pointing device interaction     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0421     [NOTE: I've implemented this one in the 19 March draft since I      don't expect that it will be controversial.]      Resolved: Accept this proposal.    d) Checkpoint 2.7: Solution for repair text should not be     minimal requirement.     Note: There is support for this proposal from Al and Denis.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0418       Resolved: Accept this proposal: This technique is sufficient     but not necessary to satisfy the checkpoint.       EH: Should that be in a Note?      CMN: I'm inclined to leave the sufficient technique is ok     for the checkpoint text, but indicate in the Note that other    solutions are possible.      (IJ: I think that that's what CMN said)      EH: I think that since it's not normative, then should be    outside the checkpoint.      IJ: But I want to make a stronger comment here: this technique    is ack'd by the WG to be sufficient. We could add to the Note    a better solution (e.g,. going to the Web to get a title of    a resource).      EH: I think we may need to provide more information about what    is expected.      IJ: We might avoid "may" and simply say "A UA satisfies this    requirement by providing. ..."      IJ: What is important, I think, is to get information that the    author provided. There may be useful information elsewhere in the    same resource or in other resources. We can just tell developers to    look around for useful information that the author may have provided    elsewhere.      Resolved:        - Mime type, URI reference, element are sufficient but not       necessary requirements.       - Adopt proposal (with possible editorial changes).       - In a Note, give developers a hint about what would constitute       useful information. Make clear in Note that other techniques        may be better (and give an example of a better technique).    e) Refer to conformance proposals regarding content/ui labels, input     device conformance, and conformance example.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0483       See also the proposal to address conformance through pointing     device and voice input and the question at the end of the     proposal about the shape of Guideline 1.     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0452       I think this proposal subsumes Al's comments:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0440       IJ: Has anyone read the proposals besides EH?       DP: I read them.       MQ: I started to read but got confused.       /* IJ reviews proposal */      IJ: Part three is an example of how to use the conformance model.        IJ: My example suggested to me that it's necessary to identify    formats in a claim.      JG: You could have a general conformance claim requirement to    indicate the formats that are supported as part of conformance.      Resolved:       - For Content type labels: you must either say "I don't do type X"    or "For conformance related to content type type X, I support these    formats...".     /* Ian explains part II of the proposal:       input modality conformanced */     EH: I think these changes are editorial and good. They don't change       any requirements.     Resolved:     - Adopt input modality proposals in:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0452     and:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0483       /* Ian explains Part I of the proposal *     Resolved:    - Adopt proposal to label each checkpoint for content, user agent,      or both.    - As to checkpoint grouping labels, Ian may leave those      (informative) because they allow related checkpoints with       different priorities to be next to each other.     /* What should Guideline 1 read? */     IJ: What about "Support full user agent operation through the       keyboard"     JG: That works with the substitution model.     IJ: But what about 1.2? Awkward to have Guideline 1 only have      one checkpoint.     IJ: What about "Support full operation through keyboard input       and text output"?     JG: I like the terminology of G1, even if we don't have checkpoints   for device-independence. We are trying to highlight the concept of   device independence; I hate to lose that concept.  You are supporting   device-independence when you do the substitution of input devices.     IJ: Maybe we can have a generic guideline and provide more rationale   why it's about dev-independence at the checkpoint level.     Resolved:     - It's ok to have an over-reaching Guideline 1.     Action IJ: Make the prose of the guideline and checkpoints explain   how the checkpoints relate to the goal of device-independence.    g) Executive summary (proposed by Eric)   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0413     JG: We shouldn't hold up the document for this, and I have a few   comments.     IJ: I still intend to edit this. (And IJ has an action still on this).     JG: I think that the executive summary should talk about themes.     IJ: Doesn't the statement of the Guidelines cover this?     JG: But those Guidelines statement are in the TOC. I think the   summary should give a different view of the document.     /* We don't have to finish this on the call */    h) Search termation. Refer to ideas from David:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0474.html     DP: Is search wrapping notification any more/less important that   other notifications that may come from the search? A lot already   happens now (e.g., you're told before a search wrap). I think we   need to be alerted when there are no more instances found.     Resolved:     - Add requirement to 9.8 alert when no more instances are found.    -----------  NOT COVERED  -----------    - Issue 468: The "at least a majority" minimal requirement needs  review.  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#468    - Issue 467: Checkpoints 3.2/3.7: Toggle placeholders off  requirement:  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#467    - Al Gilman has suggested that we may have a way to deal with    SMIL captions for checkpoints 2.5 and 4.5.     -- We need to add to the Techniques document for     the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5,     9.6, 9.7.

      Dianna,    Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed your last call  issues (323, 324, and 372-382; refer to original emails [0a and 0b]).    The complete second last call issues list [1] is available  online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been  incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].      NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call    draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have    been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.    Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with  the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward  any objections to the Director as the document advances, or  whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do  not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The  Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the  disposition of comments or not. More information about the  process we are following is available in section 5.5.2 of the W3C  Process Document [3].    On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for Adobe's review and comments,     - Ian    [0a] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0195  [0b] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0294  [1] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/  [3] http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010208/tr.html#last-call  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/    ===============================================  The UAWG disagreed with you on the following:  ===============================================    ----------------------  #377: Security issues and communication with other software       Comment: The Working Group agrees that security issues are    important, but did not make any changes to its requirements.    The Working Group did acknowledge this issue in two ways    in the document:      a) Section 1.3 includes "Security" as a known limitation    b) Section 3.4 has a subsection entitled "Restricted functionality       and conformance", which states that conformance is not affected       by a restricted view of a particular document.       You are invited to review both of these statements.    #378: Simplify language of document for non-technical audience.       Comment: This document is primarily aimed at developers of    user agents and is therefore necessarily somewhat technical    in nature. Nonetheless, it must be clearly written. The Working    Group will not produce a non-technical version of UAAG 1.0    as part of advancing along the Recommendation track. However,    the Working Group will add an executive summary to the document.    We will ask the Education and Outreach Working Group for    help producing non-technical supplements in the future.        You are invited to send specific comments about passage of the    document that are difficult to understand.    ===============================================  The UAWG agreed with you, but please confirm:  ===============================================    <RELATED>  #323: Using accessibility APIs rather than standard APIs to make  non-W3C based content accessible (checkpoint 5.4)  #379: Checkpoint 1.2: Exception when primary output (e.g., graphics)  cannot be handled by the OS?  </RELATED>      Comment: Checkpoint 6.6 states this desired requirement:"      "6.6 Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the operating    environment). Where these APIs do not enable the user agent to    satisfy the requirements of this document, use the standard input    and output APIs of the operating environment."    #372: Limitations of standard APIs in conveying author's intent or  functionality? [Note, this is the same as issue 375, by error.]      Comment: The rewrite to checkpoint 6.6 addresses this request    as accessibility APIs are given preference over input/output    APIs.    -----------------  #376: Requirement that plug-ins be given focus       Comment: Checkpoint 9.1 requires that the user be able to move the    focus to every viewport. If the plug-in is part of the conformance    claim, then your desired requirement is already addressed. If it is    not part of the claim, then the Working Group considered it a bug    rather than an accessibility problem if a piece of software that    should hand off focus by design does not (i.e., that's what plug-ins    are for, so not handing off focus is a bug).    -----------------  #381: Checkpoint 2.5: Checkpoint text needs clarification       Comment: The new checkpoint 2.7 reads:       "2.7 Allow configuration to generate repair text when the user    agent recognizes that the author has failed to provide    conditional content that was required by the format    specification. If the missing conditional content is included    by URI reference, base the repair text on the URI reference and    content type. Otherwise, base the repair text on element type    information."      Please note that there is an outstanding proposal to change the    minimal repair requirements:      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0418.html    ===============================================  The UAWG answered your question:  ===============================================    ----------------------  #324: How do developers interpret the phrase "appropriate for a task"  in checkpoint 6.2      Comment: What is now checkpoint 8.2 has been changed to require    either W3C specifications OR specifications that allow authors    to create content that conforms to WCAG 1.0. The checkpoint reads:      "8.2 Use and conform to either (1) W3C Recommendations when they are    available and appropriate for a task, or (2) non-W3C specifications    that enable the creation of content that conforms to the Web Content    Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] at any conformance level."      Thus, if a vendor claims that W3C does not have Recommendation for    a particular task, a user agent rendering another format may still    conform to UAAG 1.0 as long as the format allows authors to create    content that conforms to WCAG 1.0.    ----------------------  #380: Checkpoint 2.3: What if equivalency relationship unknowable by  format?      Comment:       - The techniques to satisfy 2.3 do not have to be screen-position     based; Option three (query) is based on the logical document     structure. Please note that checkpoint 2.3 has been revised (as     have other checkpoints in Guideline 2). Also, we have introduced     the term "conditional content", which does not affect your issue     since the requirement is still to be able to recognize     relationships from format information.       - If you don't know where the equivalents are in the content at     all, then the format is problematic per checkpoint 8.2.      =============================================================  The UAWG sought additional information but did not receive it  =============================================================    #382: Checkpoint 3.2: Hard to do in many cases (e.g., when  scripts used).       Comment: On 5 January, I asked for more information about     this comment [5], but we have not yet received a reply    from Adobe. You are invited to send more information to help    us address this issue, but for now the Working Group has    not changed the priority of checkpoint 3.2.

      27 July 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Scribe)   Harvey Bingham   Gregory Rosmaita   David Poehlman   Mickey Quenzer   Eric Hansen   Tim Lacy   Kitch Barnicle   Dick Brown    Absent:   Mark Novak   Jim Allan   Charles McCathieNevile   Jim Allan   Rich Schwerdtfeger    Next meeting: 3 August   Regrets: Jon   Chair : Ian   Scribe: Kitch      Agenda [1]  [1]  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0176.html    Discussion    -1. Madeleine Rothberg had a baby girl!!        Consensus in the WG that this is a good thing! <grin>    0. Glossaries    HB: I'm preparing a merged glossary from all 3 Guidelines.    1.Issue 257: Proposed checkpoint 10.4         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0135.html      /* Ian reviews two axes for 10.4 and 10.5 */      GR: I think that having a minimal set is a bad idea.      IJ: Note that the proposal for 10.4 is to say:     a) You must allow the user to override all default bindings     b) You must support at least this set of (20) bindings.     c) Single key ok and double key minimal. (Make this for keyboard).      KB: Note that even if not configurable, must be keyboard accessible.      GR: If we are going to set a baseline for functionalities is        to look at the definition of HTML conforming UA.      Resolved for 10.4:     1) Override UA default config     2) No requirement to override system conventional bindings.     3) Baseline set of functionalities as suggested by JG.        (part of next issue).     4) Baseline configurability for keyboard: single key or        system modifiers plus single key (note about sticky keys here).     5) Add cross-ref to 1.3.    2.Issue 257: Use the same set of functions in 10.4 as the minimal set     of functions in checkpoint 10.5 and make 10.5 only about the keyboard    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0126.html      About 10.5:      1) Proposal: Make this checkpoint only about the keyboard.       This makes "one key press" easier to explain. The idea       is that this requirement is really about someone who has       issues with keyboard actuation.         10.5 Allow the user to configure the user agent so             that the user's [preferred one-key operations]            may be activated with a single key.         EH: If you happen to be accessing the Web via telephone,       what about then?          GR: Or through a mobile device.         JG: People could be using a bat keyboard (you type in chords).          EH: If the UA is operating on a super-small device, what       happens?          JG: We don't have examples of mobile devices yet in our       techniques.         IJ: Refer to definition of single command: single key         w.r.t. a mode.         EH: Why is this different from a hierarchical set of         menus?         GR: Opera has a forms mode.         MQ: Alt-F enters "File mode".          EH: This is like the topic of multimedia - you don't know       where it stops. I think we should focus on a standard condition       for user agent operation - typical desktop operation. I think       this is the basic intent.         IJ: Sticky keys would be the same: that's two strokes.         IJ: Sounds to me like the following DO NOT meet single key       requirement:        - Sticky keys        - Key combinations        - Special modes (e.g., form navigation mode, file menu mode)        - We're not going to worry about small keyboards (with           few keys).         GR: We need to ensure that programmers understand that we're not       talking about key codes, but key strokes.         EH: So yes, we are talking about key presses, not characters.      2) Should the set of functionalities be the same as for 10.4?        IJ: I hesitate due to the potential size of the set.      GR: I have concerns if some essential functionalities           (the list of 20).       Proposed:        - Checkpoint 10.5 is only about the keyboard.       - Binding requirement: single key press.        - Set of functionalities: at least the "list of 20",         up to the set for which the UA has default keyboard bindings.       - Configurability: user needs to be able to have N single         key bindings.          IJ: What is the size of N?       GR: Depends in part on the number of keys available.        TL: It's difficult to define "N" when you don't know the           devices and parameters.           1) First of all, the interface has to be keyboard accessible.          2) What you can do with a keyboard you should be able to             remap, without interfering with the OS.          3) List of 20 fine with me.          4) If you go beyond the list of 20, you get into parameters             that depend on device, character set, etc.       HB: There is also the mnemonics that differ according to           natural language.       TL: You can find out the range of "N" at run-time.

Kudos to everyone for their hard work so far behind the scenes!!    Hi Alex,    I agree wholeheartedly that we should provide links to relevant  information from relevant pages. So if the SVG and DOM specs rely  on IDL, they should link to the IDL definition or some relevant  resource. Same goes for ECMA script, if it is referenced from  a spec. Activity home pages should also have links to related  organizations (so, for example, you'll find a link to the WAP  forum from the Mobile home page http://www.w3.org/Mobile/).    However, I don't think the home page is the appropriate place  for a bunch of links to non-W3C specs or even to related   standards organizations (except, for example, in a news item).    It would be useful to have a page dedicated to links   to other standards bodies. The Process Document has some  of this information already in an appendix [1], and one of my  projects is to move this information out of the process document  to the Web site. The question is: would people naturally  go to that special page to find links, or would they prefer to  find them in context (e.g., a link to the WAP forum from  the Mobile home page)?    Thanks for your support!        - Ian    [1]  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/appendix.html#partnerships        > Alex Vincent  > co-moderator, Website Abstraction JavaScript Programming Help Forum  >       --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello WAI Interest Group,    The review period of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (UAAG  1.0) Proposed Recommendation (PR) ended 7 April 2000, and you may be  wondering about the User Agent Working Group's (UAWG) progress since  then. The UAWG resolved most of issues raised during PR in the weeks  that followed the end of the review (thanks, in part, to a  face-to-face meeting at the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic in  Princeton, New Jersey in early April).    However, a few issues proved more difficult to resolve quickly.  Several reviewers commented that some of the requirements  (checkpoints) were too vague and it was therefore difficult to  determine what a user agent needed to implement in order to  conform. As a result, for the last several months, the UAWG has been  clarifying and sharpening the requirements of the document.  These clarifications and links to disucssion and resolutions  are documented in "Determining Conformance to the User Agent   Guidelines" [1]. The actual changes have been incorporated directly  into the UAAG 1.0 (refer to the 18 August draft [2]).    The UAWG still has a few issues [3] to resolve, but is nearly ready to  request a last call review of the document. To the extent possible,  the UAWG has made changes that clarify the document but do not add new  requirements. The complete revision history of the UAAG 1.0   and Techniques is available on the Web [4].    Your review during the upcoming last call will be very important. You  may send comments to the Working Group about the 18 August draft [2]  (and probably should send important comments), but if you intend a  substantial last call review, we recommend waiting until the last call  period begins, a more formal indicator that the UAWG considers it has  completed its task.    Thank you,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818  [3] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html  [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

This suggests to me that it is incorrect to say that someone  "has a disability period". You may say that a person "has a visual  impairment period" or that the person "has a disability in this  particular  context", but you would not be able to discuss a disability out of  context.    Does this mean we should adopt very careful language to respect  this distinction? Or does this mean that we can more casually exchange  the terms and not offend nor cause misunderstanding?     - Ian

      Reference document:       http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990617         1) Checkpoint 2.3.2: Change "is conformant to" to     "conforms to". Make this change globally.    2) Checkpoint 2.3.3: Change "are conformant to" to     "conform to".    3) Guideline 2.4: In intro text, rather than say     that text equivalents are "absolutely necessary", just     explain why they are important: they may be rendered     as speech, braille, and visually. Change the second     sentence to read something like "Since producing     text equivalents can be a time-consuming task..." and     then merge with the second paragraph. For example:       "Textual equivalents, including "alt-text", long       descriptions, video captions, and transcripts make      multimedia content accessible since text may be      rendered as speech, braille, and visually. [Add      more rationale here if desired, stealing from      WCAG.] Since producing text equivalents can be a      time-consuming task, authoring tools should      assist the author with mechanical tasks (such as?)      and help the author ensure that text equivalents      accurately convey the functionality of      the related multimedia object.    4) Drop "This will lead to an increase in the     average quality of descriptions used." I don't think     this prediction is necessary, in particular because     just before it there are four good reasons to include     pre-written descriptions. What does "average quality"     mean?    5) In checkpoints 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, change "information"     to "markup".    6) In checkpoint 2.4.2, language changes are mentioned.     How does the tool know when the language changes in     the document? If known automatically, the tool should     insert the markup itself. If not known automatically,     it can't alert the user when the information is missing.    7) Checkpoint 2.4.5: change ", which" to "that".                --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hello,    Please consider the following editorial clarification to  checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 (of the 7 May draft [1]):     3.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video.        [Priority 1]      3.5 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or        blinking text. [Priority 1]      3.6 Allow the user to turn on and off animations and        blinking images. [Priority 1]     After discussion with Charles and Eric Hansen about  these checkpoints, we concluded that the requirement  was to "freeze" video and animations. The term   "turn on and off" may be construed to mean "do not  render at all" but I don't believe that is the requirement  expressed by these checkpoints. The accessibility problem  in these cases (unless I am mistaken) arises from the   distraction of the motion, not the mere rendering of   the visual information. We do have a P2 checkpoint   about turning off the rendering of images (checkpoint 3.9).  Therefore, I propose using the term "freeze" instead  of "turn on and off" for these three checkpoints.     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000507  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    As part of resolving issues 207 [1], 211 [2], 226 [3], and 233 [4],  please consider the following definitions. Compare with the  Proposed Recommendation [0].      1) Document object       From the DOM 2 Candidate Recommendation [1]:            <BLOCKQUOTE>      The Document interface represents the entire HTML or XML      document. Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree,       and provides the primary access to the document's data.     </BLOCKQUOTE>     [1]  http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-DOM-Level-2-20000307/core.html#i-Document       Based on this, I propose:       <BLOCKQUOTE>      The document object is the user agent's representation       of resources retrieved from the Web. The data that makes up      the document object may have several origins, including      the document source (what is returned by an HTTP request      for a resource), generated content (from style sheets,       scripts, transformations, etc.), and user agent preferences.     </BLOCKQUOTE>    2) Document object model.       <BLOCKQUOTE>      A document object model is the abstraction that       governs the construction of the user agent's document       object. W3C's Document Object Model (DOM) specifies       a document object model for HTML and XML documents. The W3C      DOM specifies a standard interface for accessing HTML and XML       content. This standard interface allows authors to access and       modify the document with a scripting language (e.g., JavaScript)      in a consistent manner across scripting languages.       As a standard interface, a document object model makes       it easier not just for authors but for assistive technology       developers to extract information and render it in ways       most suited to the needs of particular users.       The relevant W3C DOM Recommendations are listed in the references.       </BLOCKQUOTE>    3) Content       <BLOCKQUOTE>     In this specification, the term "content" refers to the     document object. Some content is designed (by specification)     for "human consumption". For an HTML document, this includes     what appears between the start and end tags of elements, and     the values of some attributes (e.g., alt, title, summary).     Other content is meant for machines, including the markup     itself (e.g,. element and attribute names), some attribute     values (e.g., class, id, lang, src), style sheets, scripts,     etc.     </BLOCKQUOTE>    4) Equivalent alternatives for content         <BLOCKQUOTE>    Since <DEL>rendered</DEL> content in some forms is not always     accessible to users with disabilities, authors must specify     equivalent alternatives for content.     </BLOCKQUOTE>     /*  The rest of the definition is the same */    5) Rendered content      <BLOCKQUOTE>    The rendered content is that part of content that is     rendered in a given viewport (whether graphical, auditory,    or tactile).    </BLOCKQUOTE>      6) Source view       <BLOCKQUOTE>     A source view renders all or part of the document     object in a way that reveals the document object     model. Often, a source view presents the document     object using the syntax of the source markup      languages.     </BLOCKQUOTE>      7) User interface.       No change, but I need to review the document to verify usage.      8) I propose changing the definition of "view" to be:         The term "view" is used in this document       to describe the purpose of a particular rendering  (e.g.,       "outline view", "table of contents view", "links view").    NOTES:     - The same terms (e.g., "content" appear in other W3C      Recommendations and have different meanings. It's ok to     define their meaning in our specification to fit our needs.     - "Content" has been defined so that we don't have to     use two terms throughout the document. I need to verify     its usage throughout the document.     - We should also define "element" and "attribute" separately,      rather than as part of a definition of "content".     - This definition of content would not change the meaning     of checkpoint 2.1. We still need to resolve the scope of      2.1 in issue 207.     - Ian    [0] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-UAAG10-20000310/#terms  [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#207  [2] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#211  [3] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#226  [4] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#233  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

This from Tim Berners-Lee [1]:    "My definition of the Web is a universe of network-accessible   information, and I break the "full potential" into two by looking   at it first as a means of human-to-human communication, and then   as a space in which software agents can, though access to a vast  amount of everything which is society, science and its problems,   become tools to work with us."    [1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Architecture.html    Tim has said that the Web is first and foremost "defined"  by URIs. HTML is just another format. HTTP is just another  protocol.    From Web Characterization [2]:      "In this context we use them to describe the information      space known as the Web."    [2] http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCA-terms/    So, in my mind, the Web is an information space.

      Hello,    The issue of the normative/informative nature of the notes  after checkpoints was raised in GL [1]. Our spec says that  each checkpoint may be followed by "Optional informative notes,   clarifying examples and cross references to related guidelines   or checkpoints." A cursory review of the checkpoints reveals that  in some cases, the text after some checkpoints is normative   than the text after others.     I will review the notes this week and send a proposal to the list.     - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000AprJun/0210.html  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    The editors have produced a new draft [1] of the guidelines  based on very VERY helpful reviews from a number of  people. There are some significant changes that  should improve the usability of the document.     Not all comments have been processed yet. We will  continue to address all substantive comments by raising  them as issues either by email or at teleconferences.    If you do not feel your comments have been addressed, please  let us know as quickly as possible. If we have not  responded to your comments on the list, we may not have  gotten to them yet.    NOTE. We are publishing this document to show how  comments and WG resolutions are being incorporated.  However, this means we have essentially two  documents in last call: the original one people  were asked to review, and this internal draft.  Should reviewers (i.e., everyone) henceforth base their  comments on this draft? While I believe they should,  it is not clear in terms of the W3C Process whether  the new draft should be put on the TR page as  an updated document in last call. Judy, do you  have suggestions?

      Hello,    As part of resolving issue 232 [1], I'd like to propose the  following text for the section on conformance to explain which  user agents this document is meant for. Please note that the  abstract of the document already discusses which user agents  these guidelines are meant to address.    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Which user agents may conform    This document has been designed to promote the accessibility of  general-purpose graphical user agents. While many of the principles  set forth in this document apply to other  classes of user agents, including assistive technologies, many of the  checkpoints do not. As the number of applicable  checkpoints decreases for a piece of software, the likelihood  increases that the guidelines are not an accurate gauge of the  accessibility of that piece of software. Therefore, while assistive  technologies and other specialized user agents obviously promote  accessibility, they are not expected to conform (for instance, because  they offer a single output mode such as speech, or they do not make  available information through APIs) because  they are not general purpose user agents.  This document will help  assistive technology developers understand what functionalities and  communication an accessible general purpose user agent should provide.  </BLOCKQUOTE>     - Ian    [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#232  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Why should we talk about this in the guidelines? What requirements  do we have that would be made clearer by the use of this term?  While I agree with the above comments, and I think understanding  this is critical for us to resolve issue 207 and make the document  more solid, it is not clear to me yet that in the end,  this distinction will be useful at the checkpoint level.      > The infoset is a small step in that direction but is still mostly  > data-centric.

Therefore, how about:       Note. When available, developers should use APIs at a higher level          of abstraction than the standard device APIs for the operating          system. If these higher level APIs do not use the          standard device APIs properly, developers should also          use the standard device APIs.     - Ian    > [1] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#255  > [2] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#260  > --  > Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  > Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  > Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Here are a few discussion points so that, if I am invited to attend  part of the CSS WG during the week of the technical plenary, I can  have an informed discussion about requirements from this WG. [I have  asked for some time at their meeting and have not yet received  a reply from the WG Chair.]    The currently public CSS3 specifications include the following:      - UI and forms enhancements    - W3C selectors    - Color    - Paged media     - Ruby    but there are a number of other specs described in the   CSS3 introduction:     http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-roadmap/    1) Including accessibility information in context in the relevant     CSS3 specifications. Some examples:      - Cascading and inheritance: Importance of user control of styles.      - Importance of relative units to repurposing of content.      - UI and forms enhancements:        * Formatting control of selection.        * Cursor styles: Where are cursor semantics defined          (if these are cursor styles)?        * Some new values of the 'content' property are          device-dependent (e.g., 'hover-radio-on'). Should          device-independence be discussed/enabled/encouraged?        * Ensure that 'resizer' property allows user control of          viewport size (override of author preference).        * Need to discuss key-equivalent and tab-index requirements          for keyboard access.      2) What is status of the behavior module? Aural style sheet     module? Is work on aural style sheets being coordinated with     the Voice WG?    3) In CSS3, request that conforming user agents must allow     users to specify user style sheets, and to     turn off all author and user styles.    Note: I have not read the CSS3 specifications so I welcome   additional input for the meeting, notably from WAI PF.     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

It is my opinion that we need a structured navigation checkpoint.  We have merged a number of past checkpoints into this one and removing  it would leave a gap in the spec. I think that your proposal of  removing the list of elements is reasonable, but other checkpoints  (7.7 configuration of 7.6, and 8.4 outline) depend on this list as  part of their minimal requirements. We would have to rework the  lot of them.     -Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

I don't like the idea of sub-checkpoints. If you know what you  want specifically for conformance, create a checkpoint for it. If you  don't really know what you want, leave the checkpoint vague and clarify  in the techniques document. The ATAG 1.0 has few checkpoints and they  are high level. If more concrete checkpoints are required, add them as  first-class checkpoints.     If a checkpoint is so high level as to not be useful, make it a  Guideline.    If possible, I would like all the guidelines to use the same model:  guidelines/checkpoints/techniques. I don't know what a level  of subcheckpoints adds. It may confuse readers further.     > 2.

Up to now, I was under the impression that people wanted everything  in one document (e.g., sample information is available in the techniques  document and in separate documents). You might split along the following  lines:     - General techniques, list of resources, links to other techniques  documents     (this would be the "main" techniques document).   - Content techniques   - User interface techniques   - Sample implementations     - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Mirriam-Webster says that  "milestone"  means "a significant point in development",  and this could apply. However, for me there's also an  implication of linearity (perhaps because milestones used  to appear every mile). And the document as written does  not suggest a linear relationship among the steps.    I have no strong feelings against "milestones".     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

We never required it explicitly. Rather than  add it as a requirement in the markup language case at this late  date, the proposed change was to call out the functional  requirements only in the case we hadn't addressed (outside the  viewport).     _ Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                     +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                    +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Don't be scared off by the word "conformance" in the  subject of this message. I believe this proposal simplifies  the UAAG 1.0 conformance scheme. It does not stray far from  what we have already defined, and is, I believe, a clearer  model.    The model works as follows:    1) By default, a user agent must satisfy all checkpoints     in the document in order to conform.    2) It is possible to reduce the "scope of a claim" [new term]     in three ways:       a) Specifying a conformance level. A conformance level is        a labeled subset of checkpoints.     b) Specifying one or more content type labels (more labeled        subsets).      c) Specifying input modality labels (still more labeled        subsets). [Note: Input modality labels still a work in        progress...]       (These are the three mechanisms we have chosen to      increase the granularity of conformance claims.)    3) By default, all checkpoints *within the scope of a claim*     apply. A checkpoint that is in scope does not apply      if any of three conditions are met. (Note: We may delete one     based on some last call comments.)    Why distinguish a checkpoint that is out of scope   from one that does not apply?     - A checkpoint that is out of scope is simply not part of a    claim. The claim makes *no statement* about whether this    checkpoint is satisfied or not. It is possible, for example,   that a user agent would satisfy some, but not all, checkpoints   for the "video" content type label. The label "video" would not   appear in the claim, but the user agent would still satisfy    some of the checkpoints.     - A checkpoint that doesn't apply *is* part of a claim. The      claim states explicitly that the user agent *does not*      satisfy this checkpoint (for if it did, then the checkpoint      would clearly apply).    I think it's worthwhile making this distinction. I also think   that doing so simplifies the presentation of the material and  the definition of applicable.    Continuing the model (essentially unchanged):    4) A well-formed claim must include information about both     the scope of the claim, and for those checkpoints in scope,     which ones are not considered to apply. (A well-formed claim     must also include information about the version of UAAG     and the date of the claim.)    5) A claim is valid if:     a) Well-formed, and     b) The subject of the claim as a whole satisfies all         the applicable checkpoints that are in the scope         of the claim.    That's the model. Because I do not consider this a substantial  change from the existing conformance model (only a clarification  and simplification), I intend to integrate this into the next draft   for Working Group review.      - Ian     --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    I spent the day yesterday at Adobe (in San Jose) talking  to developers about accessibility issues. I had some very  productive discussions about a number of topics, including  UAAG 1.0, accessibility of PDF viewers, and SVG. Here are two  comments about UAAG 1.0 that I think we can address pretty  easily. Note: I look forward to a full review from Adobe  of the last call draft [1].    1) Point 1: They would like the UAAG 1.0 to include a     requirement that the conforming user agent allow      other software to capture focus. I responded that I think     our document covers that requirement in checkpoint 5.4:       "5.4 Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent           user interface controls using standard APIs ..."       Write access to the focus amounts to being able to capture     the focus and change it. At least I think so. What do other     people think? In checkpoint 5.5, we mention selection and     focus explicitly as part of user interface controls. Should     we do the same in 5.4 (or in a definition)? Should we just     say in the Techniques document that assistive technologies     and other software (in this case an SVG rendering engine)     needs to be able to take focus.       I also pointed out that checkpoint 7.1 requires navigation to     all viewports (in this case, an SVG viewport), but that doesn't     cover the issue exactly.    2) Point 2: In rendering PDF, Acrobat (on Windows) does not use     standard system calls for drawing text to the screen. Instead, it     creates a bitmap itself and causes that to be displayed. Since PDF     is a low-level page description format, is it "ok" for them to     do their own bitmap (since that's what the language is about)  creation?     Note: Acrobat Reader implements MSAA apparently, so it satisfies  checkpoint     1.2's requirement to use standard APIs for the OS. However, it does  not     use the standard device API for drawing text.    3) Point 3: Checkpoint 6.2 says to use and conform to W3C specs. Does  this     checkpoint apply to the Acrobat Reader since they only read and  render     PDF? I think that we need to consider ways to help developers and     readers interpret "appropriate for a task".        W3C doesn't (yet) specify a similar "page description format"; HTML      is not about pixel-perfect rendering on paper/the screen (the HTML  spec     emphasizes the fact that it does not require particular rendering).     You could argue that HTML + CSS are the appropriate languages, but     even that seems far-fetched to me.       A larger question is (and of course it's related to applicability):     should software that doesn't implement W3C specifications at all     be able to claim conformance? I personally would like the UAAG 1.0      to be applicable to user agents in general, not just user agents     that implement W3C formats. I think there is some grey area that     we need to work on:          - If you are creating an imitation of a W3C format (or if            W3C is creating an imitation of yours...), then for the            sake of interoperability and also because of the way W3C               works (with WAI review, etc.), you should (P2) implement            the W3C spec. So, implement PNG at least, but if you wish,            GIF, JPG, etc.            - If you are doing something entirely different, 6.2 doesn't            apply, and you can still conform.       How can we provide guidance for determining what is "available"    (e.g., implemented sufficiently) and "appropriate for a task"?     I think it's easier to talk about 'available' than 'appropriate for     a task'. I don't have any proposals today to address this.     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/     _ Ian  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Thank you for the comments, Richard. I will add issues that  you raise to our issues list [1]. My comments are below. For  your comments that are purely editorial, I will make the  appropriate corrections.

These comments are very interesting and I will take them to the  W3C Team for discussion. Though I am not a lawyer, I would  split the issue into two:    1) Rendering changes    The HTML specification describes in very few places how content should  be rendered. Therefore, anyone who writes a Web page in HTML and  expects it to be rendered in a specific way is using the wrong language  for designing their page. The fact that HTML says so little  is one reason why browsers differ in behavior today.     If we extend the discussion to style sheets, user override of style  is built into the CSS specification (CSS2 reinforces the override  by ensuring that users can have final say). Therefore, anyone using  CSS who expects to have final control over styles is using the wrong  language for style.    In short, I don't know how one would defend an argument that user  agents MUST render content in a particular manner.     2) Content changes    It is possible for users to add content to Web pages (through  transformations, style sheets, and other mechanisms). If I make  these transformations for my personal use but do not republish  them, do I infringe the author's copyright? Is it illegal  to tear pages out of a book because it has been bound too tightly  and I can't read the inside margin of the pages?    I look forward to interesting discussion on this topic.    > 3.0 Specific Comments  >   > The abstract, in an effort to define/distinguish between  "user-agents" and  > "assistive technologies" cites several examples in  each category.

I'm not sure what your comment refers to. Checkpoint 1.3 in the  last call draft [3] reads:       "Ensure that the user can interact with all active       elements in a device-independent manner."

This is text that occurs  immediately after or  > before the HREF tag. In this case of either  unspecified ALT text or specified  > null ALT text we would use proximal  text to describe the link if available.    Checkpoint 2.8 reads:         When alternative text has been specified explicitly as       empty (i.e., an empty string), render nothing.    Authors should be able to specify empty alt text when they mean,  for example, "this image is purely decorative and has no function  in the page." Thus, we ask UAs to not attempt to guess what the  function of the image is since the author has (we hope) meant  "no function" by specifying empty alt text.    Our current techniques for checkpoint 2.7 (missing Alt text)  refer to the "altifier" tool heuristics [4]. Your suggestions could  be added as another technique.

The Working Group elected to reduce the priority of turning  off  (static) image rendering because rendering images did not raise barriers  to  accessibility.

Good idea. That's how we handle other checkpoints that are important  special cases. However, I think 5.4 is more a special case  of 5.3 than 5.5 (which is more about change than read/write access).    > [Checkpoints 6.1 & 6.2]  >   > Again, the distinction between these two checkpoints, besides their  priority,  > is barely discernable from the description.

I agree that 6.1 is a special case of 6.2 for W3C specifications.  However, 6.1 is not limited to W3C specifications (it would include,  for example, Java, in my opinion).    > [Guideline 7.

I don't think that's true. If I enter a long page (that requires  scrolling  to view the entire contents) but I leave the page via a link at the  top of the page, there is no guarantee that I have viewed anything below  the first screen (nor that I have viewed a piece of content in the  first screen that I may have missed, or understood if written in a  language I don't understand, etc.)    >  In contrast, direct  navigation features on a page presented serially,  > such as through  Text-To-Speech conversion may cause entire sections of  > content to be  missed and "context may be lost".    I think the Web is mostly about direct access through links and  therefore,  there are few guarantees of sequential access to information.   The traditional narrative structure is lost (or rather augemented) in  the  hypertext model.     > [Checkpoint 7.5]  >   > Navigating just among active elements seems at least as important as   > navigating through the elements of a table (Checkpoint 7.3).

I think that a "Favorites" functionality is useful (like a Back/Forward  functionality) but is probably a technique for another checkpoint  related to navigation.

      Hello,    We are nearly ready to go to Candidate Recommendation. I have  updated three documents:    26 January Guidelines    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/CR-UAAG10-20000126      Changes:        1) Important. Updated the conformance statement based on the 25  January                             unified conformance scheme.         2) Changed all occurrences of "alternative equivalent"           to "equivalent alternative" as in WCAG and ATAG.         3) Incorporated editorial comments from Judy Brewer.         4) Switched checkpoints 3.8 and 3.9 to put them in the correct           priority order.         5) The PDF version of the spec is no longer gzipped.       26 January Techniques    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000126      Changes:       1) Added a cross-reference from checkpoint 5.6 techniques          to the appendix on in-process loading. Also added some verbiage  as          the beginning of clarificationon the meaning of "timely".        2) Added some techniques to 10.9 about turning on/off controls           based on a Charles request.        3) Based on Mark Novak comment, added some info to Appendix 4           on where to find access info in MS Windows.     26 January Implementation Report    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20000126      Changes:      - Additional Netscape/Linux information     - Additional Amaya information     - Additional links to documentation for Opera and Amaya     - Changed the word "difficult" to "may require developer       documentation"     - Removed the word "claim" from some descriptions.    Thank you,     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Hi folks,    I agree with Kynn that we are here to meet the needs of   all users with disabilities. If we have not done so to date,   it is certainly not out of ill will, and therefore I don't   think apologies are required. It is more likely that other   constraints, including human resources, time, and   understanding the problems, have prevented us  from doing more (and more is clearly required).     I personally cannot apologize for being busy trying to   produce three Recommendations to promote the accessibility  of the Web. I am convinced that all of us here are just  as dedicated and just as busy. There is more work to be  done, notably on CD, and the WG has been expending considerable  energy and bandwidth to improve the situation.    Please continue to use the list to promote and exchange  ideas so that more can be done for the communities we  are trying to serve. If you want to address extra-professional  issues, please do so off the list with the Chairs or the   W3C Team members in this Working Group.

      Olivier,    Thank you for the comments. Due to my own scheduling constraints, I have  not been able to incorporate any changes into the UA Guidelines since  the  9 March draft. We will be publishing this draft to the TR page tonight  or tomorrow. Your comments are appreciated and will be considered by  the working group and incorporated into the next draft.     > Second, we would like to make some comments about some checkpoints :  >         - checkpoint 5.3.1 : must be a priority 1    In the 10 March teleconf [1], the WG discussed the priority of  this checkpoint (Allow the user to navigate sequentially among links.).  It was decided to ensure that priority of 6.2.1 as Priority 1  (Allow the user to navigate sequentially among all active elements in  the document.)  and to keep the special case of just links as a priority 2. I don't  think this  discuss has ended yet.

      Hello,    Per my action item of 10 April [1], here is a proposed  change to clarify the wording of checkpoint 4.15:    <OLD>   4.15 Allow the user to configure how the focus changes.  </OLD>    <NEW>   4.15 Allow the user to configure whether the focus         moves automatically to a viewport that opens without         an explicit request from the user.  </NEW>    Notes:     1) I think the minimal requirement is to prevent focus from moving      or to allow it to move.     2) I've added the "explicit request from the user" from 4.16.      This might be removed, but I understand the real accessibility      problem to be that the user is unaware of the new viewport.     3) Checkpoint 4.16 talks about user interface controls other      than viewports. Should this checkpoint be generalized to      prompts, alerts, etc.? Refer also to the minutes of 10 April       for the proposal to delete 4.16.[2]. The larger requirement      of 4.16 could be moved thusly to the revised 4.15.     4) Should this checkpoint be expressed in the negative      instead? "Allow the user to configure the focus behavior so that      it does not automatically move to a viewport that opens without       an explicit request from the user."     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/rfbd-20000410#issue-223  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/rfbd-20000410#issue-224  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    At the 20 July teleconference [1], Eric Hansen suggested that  the UA Guidelines (presumably including the 7 July draft [2])  uses the terms style/content inconsistently:        "In some places, we don't distinguish style and content, in     others we do. We need to elaborate our definition of content."    The definition of "content" in that draft says that   "content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts."  The document object definition says that "the document object   is the user agent's representation of data (e.g., a document)."  This would include style sheets. I think we should leave this  definition as is.    For distinguishing structure from presentation (both conveyed  in content) I propose that we do what was done in the   Authoring Tool Guidelines, which defines the terms structural   markup [3] and presentation markup [4]. I propose that we   reuse or adapt those definitions (quoted below) as necessary.    All of this relates to issue 297 [5], which is entitled   "Style v. content and background sounds" (the title needs fixing   since it opposes style and content).    The question is how much UA control is required over certain   types of content, notably when that content is used to achieve  a presentation effect? I think that the answer depends on the  type of content:    1) Users need full control of content whose purpose is not a      presentation effect. The first question is: can we distinguish     content intended for a presentation effect from content not     intended for a presentation effect? My answer would be: the     best we can do is rely on what we can recognize as being     for style: HTML transitional elements and attributes,     style sheets, known non-standard markup such as bgsound.      (Yes, authors may misuse structural markup for a presentation      effect and vice-versa.)       Note that I don't have a term for "content not intended for     a presentation effect." I think we tend to use the term      "content" (meaning "having information") here, and that's the     source of the inconsistency. We can oppose style and structure,      and style with non-style. Do we need a term for "non-style"?      (I hope we don't.)       I would also note that this discussion sounds a little like the     discussion about content meant for humans v. content meant for     machines. Refer to Al's comments on this topic [7]:         "The distinction between data (raw content) and meta-data        (markup) is an artifact of the view assumed by the author.         There is no fundamental semantic difference between what is        called data vs. metadata.  They both play the same role as        bearers of information  Semantically, it is all just       one class of data.  This is a little-understood fact of        information science."       Al, will you make the same comment about an assertion that     presentation v. non-presentation (or structure)?     2) Users also need control of content whose purpose is for presentation,     but the level of control depends on the nature of the content     (I would argue).  In some cases, "on/off" control may not     suffice for providing access. For example, the user needs to be     able to select a font family that provides access (and can't     just turn off fonts). In other cases, I think that on/off control     suffices; access is made possible by being able to turn off     blinking content, animations used for decoration, and background     sounds used for decoration. While fine tune control might be     useful, I think that a requirement to turn off the interfering  content      is the Priority 1 requirement.    I think my proposal for issue 5 that arose during the   Mac IE evaluation [6] is still appropriate in this light.      - Ian    P.S. The proposal should include a comment that independent  control of volume for different audio sources should NOT be  required for background sounds. The user must be able to  configure the UA to not render this merely decorative sound,  and that should suffice.

For      example, headings, sections, members of a list, and components       of a complex diagram can be identified using structural      markup. Structural markup should not be used incorrectly to       control presentation or layout. For example, authors should not      use the BLOCKQUOTE element in HTML [HTML4] to achieve an       indentation visual layout effect. Structural markup should be      used correctly to communicate the roles of the elements of       the content and presentation markup should be used separately to      control the presentation and layout."       "Presentation markup" is markup language that encodes     information about the desired presentation or layout of the content.     For example, Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS1], [CSS2]) can be     used to control fonts, colors, aural rendering, and graphical     positioning. Presentation markup should not be used in place of     structural markup to convey structure. For example, authors should     mark up lists in HTML with proper list markup and style them with     CSS (e.g., to control spacing, bullets, numbering, etc.). Authors     should not use other CSS or HTML incorrectly to lay out content     graphically so that it resembles a list.

The lack of a name attribute  means that no image can use this map as a graphical image map. So  it's purpose could only be to contain some other navigation mechanism.    I'm not sure why identifying MAP elements that create navigation  mechanisms  is even an issue: MAP is only used for purposes of navigation. User  agents  could allow users to turn off the rendering of any MAP content while  still parsing and handling what is specified by that content (i.e.,  active  regions).    IJ: I recommend an additional technique for creating accessible  graphical and text image maps until user agents do this themselves:     - Most older user agents render MAP content but not AREA content. If  you     put both in today, the A elements will be rendered as text links and     the AREA elements will produce the graphical image map.     - Use "coords" on the A elements. User agents that support HTML 4.01  will      ignore the AREA elements when mixed with A elements. So in effect,     the A elements do all the work, which was the goal of this change in      HTML 4.0 to begin with: get rid of AREA.    (This is all described in HTML 4.01).     - Ian     > For comparison, the current HTML Techniques module  > [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WCAG10-TECHS-20000309/html-techniques.html]  > contains the following text:  > <blockquote>  > 6.2 Grouping and bypassing links  > Checkpoints in this section:  > 13.6 Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until  > user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group.

I wondered yesterday (when writing the email)  whether single command should be w.r.t. the keyboard only.

I don't think the term "single command" that has variable meanings  (e.g., key press with or without modifier) is useful. What is the  difference, at that point, between "Ctrl-X" and   "Ctrl-X Ctrl-Y Ctrl-Z"? What is the boundary of a single command?    I understand the desire to have easy, simple, direct access. However,  I don't think that "single command" is any more precise. And, as I  mentioned, I think using the term "single" in two contexts is dangerous.    In conclusion, I think that making 10.5 for the keyboard only is  an interesting option that I could live with. But I don't want to use  the term "single command" in the document.     _ Ian     > [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0134.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Difference:     A paragraph of text may end up being an equivalent for an illustration,   and the user may know that by hearing it, but the user agent can't   recognize it as such. So that is a text equivalent supplied by the   author, but not specified as being one.     > Can anyone think of an example?  What was meant by a system-generated  > equivalency?  What part of the system is generating this relationship or  > content?  Is this captured in an issue that ever crossed through the issues  > list?    Yes, we've dealt with this before: author-specified v. user  agent-recognized.  We have both in the document, for different reasons.  For example,  checkpoint 2.4 includes "Respect author-specified synchronization cues   during rendering." and that is meant to say: respect what the author  has specified. It is not appropriate in this context to say "do whatever  you can figure out."    Similarly, 4.1 - 4.4 include 'author-specified' because it's about  overriding  presentation that the author has specified. Same for checkpoint 9.3.    At times (e.g., checkpoint 8.1), at least to my memory, we use  "author-specified"  to narrow the scope of the requirement for the developer. For instance,  for  checkpoint 8.1, we say "author-specified relationships among table  cells"  so that developers don't think they have to invent, or infer  relationships  among cells.    Checkpoint 2.1 uses the expression "recognized equivalents" as opposed  to "author-specified equivalence" so that if the UA is clever (i.e.,  cleverer than what is strictly stated by the author), it still has  to do something with information it recognizes.    For consistency with 2.1, I agree with Al that we should use  "recognized" instead of "author-specified".     - Ian    Previous discussion on this topic:     April 2000 face-to-face meeting, issue 210      http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/rfbd-20000410      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#210     (I'm sure we've already changed some checkpoints in light of this    discussion, but I don't have other URIs for the moment.)    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    Please consider the following changes to the UAGL   (27 August version [1]). This proposal attempts to resolve  various questions (e.g., [2]) about how different types of user  agents will conform to the document. The proposed changes  remove the need (I hope) for a graphical/dependent split  while keeping the goals of the checkpoints intact. The  last change suggests a split of a different sort to  address interoperability.    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990827   [2] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#79    PROPOSAL 1) Checkpoint 1.1. The current text:          Ensure that all functionalities offered through         the user interface may be operated through standard         input device APIs supported by the operating system.       I propose that we split this checkpoint into two:         a)  Ensure that all functionalities offered through            the user interface are available through all supported           input devices. Note: The device-independence           required by this checkpoint applies to functionalities           described by the other checkpoints in this document           unless otherwise stated by individual checkpoints.         b)  Use standard input device APIs provided by the            operating system.         The text of (a) comes from previous versions of the      guidelines. However, I think checkpoint 1.1 in [1] mixes      two very important points: all functionalities must be available      AND use standard input device APIs. Thus, I propose the split.        I have noted that while reviewing Netscape Navigator, that verifying      (a) is near impossible unless you are a developer or have access to      details about how the tool's internal APIs connect to the interface.      I propose that we include a note in the document that informs users      that it may be difficult to verify certain checkpoints without      detailed software documentation.     PROPOSAL 2) Checkpoint 3.2. The current text:         Ensure that the user has access to the content of       an element selected by the user.       This checkpoint is the evolution of a requirement for access      to individual cells, list items, etc. However, I think some     of the intent is lost in the current wording. I propose      the following:         Ensure that the user has access to the document       structure expressed by markup in an output        device-independent manner.            For example, ensure that the user can clearly          understand the content of a table cell, the         content of a list item, the content of a header,         etc.         Techniques:       a) Provide a view of the document structure (e.g.,          a tree view of all elements).        Note that "output device-independent manner" means      for output devices supported by the software.    PROPOSAL 3) Checkpoint 3.3. This checkpoint should not be      for dependent user agents only. Refer to issue 84.       [2] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#84       PROPOSAL 4) Checkpoint 8.3. The current text:           Allow the user to navigate just among table cells of         a table (notably left and right within a row and up          and down within a column).        I propose that this checkpoint be for all users agents, with      the following note afterwards:           Navigation techniques include keyboard navigation from         cell to cell (e.g., using the arrow keys) and scrolling.         Note, however, that users must be able to navigate in         an input-device independent manner.     PROPOSAL 5) Checkpoint 9.2. The current text:           Provide the user with information about the number         of viewports.        I suggest that the principle of this checkpoint applies to      all user agents. I suggest that it be rewritten:           List all viewports (including frames).        Netscape 4.6 lists windows and frames, Lynx      lists frames, Opera 3.51 lists windows and allows keyboard      navigation of frames, IE 4 lists windows (but I don't see      how to list frames). All of NN, IE, and Opera allow you to      view the HTML source, which is a clunky way to find the      frame structure.          PROPOSAL 6) Checkpoint 9.3. The current text:         Allow the user to view a document outline       constructed from its structural elements        (e.g., from header and list elements). [Priority 2]       I don't think this should be for dependent user agents only.     My question is this: does a view of the markup count? It is     not navigable, but it is searchable. I realize that this forces     users to read markup, which is not desirable.    PROPOSAL 7) I propose that we move checkpoint 6.6 (operating system     conventions) to Guideline 7 and rename Guideline 7 as    "Support standard interfaces, conventions, and languages".    PROPOSAL 8) Having removed checkpoint 6.6, Guideline six is only    about communication among software. This guideline is    meant to make general purpose browsers accessible by    having them communicate with assistive technologies    that are taking advantage of work already done by    the browser (or other user software). While it would    be good if assistive technologies communicated through    standard means, I don't believe that was the original    intent of this guideline.       To avoid definitions like "graphical desktop    browser" and "dependent user agent", I propose that    we allow two other types of conformance:       a) Conformance as a stand-alone user agent:             You don't have to satisfy any checkpoints             in Guideline 6.     b) Conformance as an interoperable user agent.             You have to satisfy all the checkpoints             in Guideline 6.      This split is natural - it is precisely about interoperability    and not other user agent functionalities.      This proposal may seem to undermine the goal     of interoperability. I don't think it does. If a user    agent developer doesn't care about interoperability,    they won't satisfy these checkpoints anyway, even if the    the software highly accessible in other ways or to    targetted users. We are still saying    that interoperability is important and also "If you    want to ensure interoperability, you must do these things."    However, interoperability is not the only element of     accessibility. That's why there are other guidelines.    OPEN ISSUE: There are two remaining checkpoints currently listed  as being for dependent UAs only: 9.8 and 9.9: access to cell headers  and table dimensions. Checkpoint 9.9 is Priority 3, and it might  be simplest just to make it apply to all user agents. Checkpoint  9.8 is priority 1. I haven't figured out yet how to modify these  checkpoints.       - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hello,    At the 20 December teleconference [1], we resolved for issue 420 [2]  not to make any change to checkpoint 8.3 regarding prompting before  following a fee link. This is a request to reconsider that decision.    In the 23 October draft [3], the checkpoint reads:      8.3 Render in a distinct style those links that have been         marked up to indicate that following them will involve a         fee and allow the user to configure this style.         For graphical viewports, offer at least three        rendering options, including colors and fonts.        Allow the user to select from among the range of system        colors and fonts.    Here's why I think the decision should be reconsidered:     - We argued that since this is not a pervasive problem      today on the Web in terms of *user agent responsibilities*,      it was not urgent to address with a prompting requirement      in UAAG 1.0.      - However, this is done today using plug-ins. In fact,     the 25 August 1999 Micropayments Working Draft [4] states:        <BLOCKQUOTE>      For current browsers, embedding information in HTML       pages MUST be done using a Per Fee Link Handler, which      MUST  be a plug-in or JAVA Applet.      </BLOCKQUOTE>     - 8.3 and 8.X (proposed below) don't apply for formats      that don't allow authors to mark up fee links.     "Fee link" is a role of content that cannot be recognized      in HTML, for example. Thus, 8.3 and 8.x do not impose     additional burdens on existing browsers.     - If feel links are not used widely today, and browsers     don't yet implement these features, we should be ahead of     the curve and ensure that we require them to do the     right thing now. I recognize that we need implementation      experience to see whetherexisting plug-ins allow      configuration to prompt users before charging them.      - It is always possible to claim conformance with the     addition of a plug-in that supports fee links.    Thus, after reflection, I support the reviewer's   suggestion (which the WG agreed was a good idea) and   believe that:     1) It's a P2 requirement to prevent activation of a link      that may involve a fee.     2) It's a P3 requirement to inform the user through style      that following a link may involve a fee.    Therefore I propose:     1) Changing 8.3 to a P3 checkpoint.     2) Adding the following P2 checkpoint:      8.X Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm        the activation of any link that has been marked up to        indicate that following it will involve a fee.    Comments:     a) Checkpoint 8.5 already allows the user to query links for      information about fees.      - Ian    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0430.html  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#420  [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/  [4] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-Micropayment-Markup-19990825   --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      Hello,    The following proposal addresses software consistency. The  proposal fulfills an action item that I received at the  16 June teleconference.     <begin proposal>    Proposed Guideline: Ensure consistent user agent behavior from                      release to release.    Rationale: Consistency promotes orientation across software versions.    Changes to user agent behavior across releases of the   user agent should not be arbitrary. Changes that  promote consistency (e.g., with operating system conventions  or other software) and accessibility are encouraged.    Proposed Checkpoints:    - Organize user interface controls in a manner    consistent with previous versions and self-consistent with    the user agent's conventions.    - Deliver software with a consistent default keyboard     configuration.    - Ensure that profiles may be reused (directly    or through easy conversion) between versions.    - Clearly document significant changes to the software, notably    those known to affect accessibility.    <end proposal>    The following ideas relate to consistency as well, and  I jot them down here as part of my consistency brain dump.    - Allow user to run in compatibility mode.    - Allow several versions of the software to run on the    same machine (to allow testing).    - Don't convert user data (e.g., profiles) without    the user's approval.    - Allow the user to uninstall the software and find    the previous version intact.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

      Hello,    This proposal comes from an action item received at the  28 July teleconf [1].     In the 16 July revision of the UAGL [2], checkpoint 9.9 reads:      9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content.         [Priority 3]          For example, use HTTP header information or language         attribute information from the document root.     Proposed change (Priority 1, for assistive techologies):      Render content according to natural language changes    identified by markup. For unsupported natural languages,     allow the user request prompting when language changes.    NOTES:    a) This checkpoint is meant to cover checkpoints 4.1 and 4.3     from WCAG 1.0: both primary language and language changes.     Note that since 4.1 is priority 1, this one is too.    b) This checkpoint is also meant to allow users to turn on/off     support for alerts to language changes.     - Ian      [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0056.html  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-19990716   [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814

So if you want to keep the document at the current level (synth  speech v. the rest of audio), that's ok. But is it easier for  developers to distinguish synth from other sources or treat  everything the same? And is synth a special case that merits  a requirement while other types of audio do not?     -Ian    > At 09:26 AM 6/13/00 -0400, you wrote:  > >Jon Gunderson wrote:  > > >  > > > Ian,  > > > So every time a sound object is rendered to the user will be prompted for  > > > volume for that resource?  > >  > >You're not prompted.

      Hello,    In the 1 September UAAG 1.0 [1], checkpoint 6.1 is P1 and reads:      Implement the accessibility features of all supported specifications     (markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages,    graphics formats, etc.). Accessibility features are those identified     in the specification and those features of the specification     that support requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility     Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10], the "Authoring Tool Accessibility     Guidelines 1.0" [ATAG10], and the current document. [Priority 1]     The issue of whether this checkpoint should have a relative priority  has already been raised (number 111 [2]), and at the Princeton  face-to-face, we resolved to leave it a P1 checkpoint [3]. Eric  has recently broached the topic again [4], asking:       "Is it a Priority 1 UAAG requirement to ensure that       features that support all three_ WCAG and ATAG priority       levels are implemented?"    In fact, I see a bug in the UAAG 1.0 spec since it refers   at a P1 level to "those features of the specifcation that support   the requirements of ... the current document") and not all  the requirements are P1.     If I recall, the strongest argument against a relative priority  for this checkpoint was that even if a requirement is P3 in WCAG,  it is important for user agents to implement such features, otherwise  there is no pressure to provide the support author's need. I believe  the same argument may be made for ATAG requirements that refer to  content, but not necessarily those that refer to user interface.    PROPOSED FIX:      - Delete "and the current document" from 6.1. Thus, to conform      to this document, you must satisfy the checkpoints of this document      and relevant requirements of other documents at a P1 level      - Delete the reference to ATAG 1.0 (since content requirements      covered by WCAG and  user interface requirements covered by UAAG).      - Clearly state that we mean *all* requirements of WCAG 1.0 (P1, P2,  and P3).    <NEW>    Implement the accessibility features of all supported specifications     (markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages,    graphics formats, etc.). Accessibility features are those identified     in the specification and those features of the specification     that support requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility     Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10] [Priority 1]   </NEW>     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000901/  [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991210#issue-111  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0397.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

A viewport is the window, frame, etc.  through which content is viewed. Both apply to your question.  I think that it's reasonable to ask that user agents make  available equivalent alternatives in each viewport upon request.   However, this doesn't mean, in my opinion, that it all has to  be on the "canvas" where the primary content is rendered. For  instance, you could query selected elements for attribute values  and that information would be available through the viewport,  but not "inline" as it were.     > 2.

You could say that you're configuring the viewport. However, you  are probably changing your view of data by hiding some.     - Ian       > Thanks,  > Jon  >   > Jon Gunderson, Ph.D., ATP  > Coordinator of Assistive Communication and Information Technology  > Chair, W3C WAI User Agent Working Group  > Division of Rehabilitation - Education Services  > College of Applied Life Studies  > University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign  > 1207 S.

I think there are other reasons (and I'm deriving these comments  from discussions with Eric Hansen):    1) All content must be available only to eyes, only to ears, and  only to fingertips. (Refer to my comments on grouping checkpoints  and the category of perception and the senses.)    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2000JulSep/0197.html    2) Given the state of current technologies (that are readily available,  not too expensive, and accurate enough), text is the best way to  ensure that information can reach all of those senses. Text is not  ideal for communicating all information (graphics and audio are often a   lot more effective than text, some users can't read visually displayed  text,  deaf non-readers seem to lose entirely in this model, etc.) However,  today's tools handle text characters as input much better than  images of text (OCR) or voice-to-text translation (although that seems  to be improving). How good is general visual-to-auditory translation?  Or auditory-to-visual?    Thus, I think the emphasis on text is not strictly bound to  assumptions of literacy but requirements to reach eyes, ears,  and fingertips.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

Please refer to page for tracking upcoming CR review        http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/01/reviewers-cr       3. Will attempt for week of 10 April for next face-to-face.        DA: Early the week of the 10th better for me.          Action JG: Find a host/date for the meeting.    3)  Issue LC#142: Checkpoint 1.5 (output device-independence) needs  clarification.        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#142          IJ: Refer to DP's action to rewrite 1.5.         Action IJ: Repropose checkpoint 1.5.       Action GR: Contact DP offline to follow up on his action.    4) Issue LC#158 Propose priority change (1 to 2) for checkpoint      4.1 (control of font family)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#158        JG: Objections from JG and DP on the resolution to go to P2.       JG: I work with people with visual impairments. Serifed fonts         like Times NewRoman are difficult to read.     GR: From conversations offline, people feel that this is P1.       Observation: Lots of evidence that implementable.       DB: You can change fonts in IE.    CMN: You can do with style sheets.     RS: Does this checkpoint apply to cell phones?    CMN: The requirement, yes. However it may not apply to those         phones that only have one font available.      /* Discussion about mobile technologies */       DA: One way to specify the font is presumably through style         sheets.     RS: I think that 4.1 (in 20 December GL) should be P2. Part of         the problem is the number of P1 checkpoints we have.      CMN: We should resist that pushback. The goal is to solve the         problems people face.        DB: I share some of RS's concerns, but I think this one is         very important. I personally have problems reading some          pages.       GR: I think that it's        a) Important        b) Implemented        c) Implementable.          And thus P1.       RS: I can live with this as P1.     JA, HB: P1.       Resolved: Make the checkpoint a P1.      /* Discussion of applicability of Guidelines to mobile devices */       IJ: Recall W3C Mobile IG review of last call draft:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0533.html         Action MQ: Ask Mark Hakkinen about mobile devices and the                guidelines.       Action JG: Take issue of mobile devices/guidelines in next                WAI CG meeting.    5) Issue WD#179: Priority of 5.8 should be Priority 1        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#179         JG: 5.6 in 20 December draft         "Follow operating system conventions and accessibility settings"        IJ: I would argue that not following conventions is not a P1          issue. A tool may be very accessible and not follow          conventions (might be hard, admittedly). An inaccessible          tool would have other problems more grave than not following          conventions.       CMN: I think a sliding priority scale might be useful here.          I think we probably make the most important ones P1           explicitly in these guidelines. Therefore, probably ok to          stay P2.       Resolved: Leave a P2.    6) Issue WD#180: 10.8 should be priority 2        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#180         JG: 10.8 from 20 December 1999 Draft. Alan Cantor thinks that         for learning and cognitive disabilities, should be P2.        DA: I think that it's also a physical disability issue          (too close, too far).        DB: Is this about toolbar customization?        JG: yes.             DB: It sounds like we're trying to solve a problem of          bad design.        DB: Note that there are keyboard equivalents for most of the          controls.       CMN: But often not direct; require tabbing. I'd like to be able          to change the tabbing order...           GR: For people with certain types of disabilities, the visual          iconic information is easier to retain than a list of           commands. Thus, being able to rearrange the chrome is          important for consistency, knowing where things are.        DB, RS: Still think it's P3.      JA, HB, CMN: I'm on the fence.        RS: Seems like ability to change tabbing is a lot of work          to change bad design.        JG: My concern is that this is a general checkpoint. You          could do things that don't enhance accessibility and           still conform.        IJ: I think the close together/far apart requirement is          probably P2. I don't know how to express the learning          disability requirement as clearly.       CMN: Jonathan Chetwyn always talks about "show/hide".        DA: Not just toolbars: menus, etc.        RS: Be careful, you're almost reproducing the work of the          authoring tools layout requirement.       CMN: I think we need to specify what we need more.         Action CMN: Follow up on this with some learning disability       people.         IJ: It sounds like, however specific the requirement, some          configurability would be required. But it sounds like there          will be resistance to configurability, so how do we hope          to advance here?        RS: I think it should be there, but P3. Is the order of toolbar          buttons a P2?        JG: What about limiting to "toolbar"?        RS: Yes, those boundaries are more resonable, but ...        DB: This doesn't feel like a P2 to me.         Action DA: Follow up with Alan Cantor (done by email during  meeting).        DA: Looking at techniques, they are all based on current toolbars.        We will take this to the list.    7) Issue WD#182: Should searching equivalent text be an AT  responsibility        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#182             7.5 Allow the user to search for rendered text content,              including text equivalents of visual and auditory               content. [Priority 2]         JG: Note that this is for rendered text only.        IJ:         - If it's rendered for some people, it must be rendered for all          people.        IJ: What does it mean to search on something that's not rendered?          What happens when it's found? Will you have to rerender          content?        GR: My concern: people work in a corporate environment; they can't          change options or preferences. They have image loading turned          on and can't turn it off.        IJ: (One technique is view source.)        IJ: It doesn't make sense to me that socially, someone cannot          access a browser's functionalities and therefore to require          the browser vendors to do more.        RS: I'm familiar with this problem (working on JavaOS). Some          clients are downloadable that can only be configured by the          sysadmin. It's not the application that has the problem,          it's the policy. What needs to be fixed is not the UA.        GR: I agree it's not the UA's responsibility to make up for          bad management.        IJ: I think that it's not useful to fish around in the dark:          ask the UA to render and then look for things.        GR: If the requirement is only rendered text, we need to highlight          this in the AT appendix. Searching and configuration of non          rendered info may be left to ATs (refer to JFW).         Action IJ: add this info to appendix.            HB: What about META? Are we allowing people to search for that?        IJ: Today, no one has access to it.        CMN: It's not part of the semantics of HTML to render META. It is,          for example, to render "title" and "alt".        JG: In fact, people put information in META that they *don't*          want rendered.       CMN: It seems counter-intuitive to find something that you don't          know is there (since it's not rendered).        GR: Netscape gives you an information page. No meta information.          But that's clearly a place where that information could be          exposed.        No objections to leaving P2 as is.    8) Issue WD#183: Proposed rewording to checkpoint 7.5 (search alt  content)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#183          IJ: What's the difference?       Resolved: shorten to checkpoint text to:         Checkpoint 7.5 Allow the user to search for rendered text                       content, including rendered text equivalents.      CMN: I wonder whether we need a requirement for view source...?       IJ: Isn't that a technique for structured view?    9) Issue WD#184: Proposed simplification to checkpoint 1.1       (device-independent access)        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#184       Proposed:          1.1 Ensure that each functionality available      through the user interface is also      available through each supported input       device API. Excluded from this requirement      are functionalities that are part of an input      API itself (e.g., text input for the keyboard      API, pointer motion for the pointer API,       etc.)       IJ: I might change to "through each input device API supported         by the user agent" for clarity.       Resolved: Adopt the proposal.     Action Ian: Adopt this wording.    10) Issue WD#185: clarification of "single key" access        http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#185        GR: When you have to hold down one key and press another, that's         a problem.       JG: Sticky keys is available, but requires a second key.       RS: I think we need to give users the option of:       a) Either a single stroke       b) A sequence, without being required to hold down a modifier.       DA: I think direct access to a subset of functionalities is what        people want.       RS: We differentiate "key sequence" from "key chord" (one or more).       Goals:       - Avoid key chord.       - Single key is best, but not always applicable.       - Sequence applicable in some cases (e.g., where motion         involved).       IJ: We mean "Every functionality that may be operated through                  a single stroke, but not all functionalities assigned                  at once to single keys."       DB: But functionalities aren't always one step. I think we are  talking         about macros.       IJ: Take case of print: you have both "single stroke" printing        and the preferences menu (for multiple changes). You want single        key for the former, doesn't apply to latter.       GR: substitute "any" for "every".       Action DB: Send proposal for new text for this requirement.

Status: Done.       DB: He didn't think there was much that pertained to SAMI. But           will take a look at it. Is anyone looking at HTML+Time?           I'll ask him about that.      16.DB: Review techniques for Guideline 5          Status: Done. I've also asked Tim Lacy to do a review. He'll                be back next week. I'll also send to the IE Team.      17.DB: Contact person in Windows media group to agree to            review last call draft when available          Status: Pending.

Can I conference in?       IJ: We could use IRC and possibly a W3C bridge.        DB: MS could pay for the setup.       Action JG: Talk to Rich about setting up teleconf.    3) Announcements:       a) <strong>Today</strong> is the registration deadline for        Austin.       b) Teleconf scheduled for TUESDAY 7 December at 12pm (for 90 mins)        We'll set the agenda for the ftf meeting at this teleconf.             c) No teleconf 8 December (due to travel).       d) We need to renew the bridge for the first quarter of 2000.        Some suggestions to see the call moved to Thursday at the        same time. Would start first week in January.          CMN: I'll be in Australia. It would be a big help to me.        DA: Much better for me.        DB: No problem for me.        IJ: Works for me.        KB: May be a problem for me.        MRK: May be a problem for me. Later better.          Proposed time at 13:00 ET.         Action Jon: send to the list.    4) Issue 114     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#114       JG: Rich isn't here, I'd rather hold off on this.     DA: Any language that would refer to the most recent DOM REC         should be ok.       We will wait until Rich is on the call.    5) On incorporating techniques       CMN: In ATAG, we decided on a model that unless someone complained          about a technique, it made it into the document.       IJ: That's the way I've been working on the techniques.       GR: We are anticipating a final techniques review?       IJ: What form would that take? I think a teleconf doesn't work.       IJ: I propose:       a) Ask for review       b) If no objections, I'll just add and edit.      6) On incorporating editorial changes to guidelines       IJ: Will there be a new GL draft for the ftf? I propose that         we do, that take into account Eric's edits.       Resolved: Ian will produce a new draft 6 December          for the ftf that takes into account suggestions from Eric.         People can send comments/objections and we can discuss         issues at face-to-face.       DP: Comment on the introduction: In the bulleted list in         the intro, put cognitive in the same group with visual,          auditory, physical. Might separate disabilities         from universal access issues.       IJ: Ok.    7) Issue 111           http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111       IJ: Eric Hansen thought 6.1 should be relative priority.      Issue #6: Checkpoints 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 need restructuring and  revision.       Proposed: new checkpoint "Provide single-stroke access     to user agent functionalities".       DA: Not enough keys to go around.       DP: I think the proposal is too vague.         KB: Do we want the UA developer to make the choice of         what should have single-key access? Second level         is allowing the user to make that choice? I worry about         the case where the developer builds in a lot of          single key access and that the user inadvertently         activates functionalities.       MRK: You could have some single-key defaults.       JG: Highlight in navigation section? for high-frequency         functions.       GR: Point to common single-key defaults per platform (conventions).       KB: What's an example of single key access? Is "Alt-F" a single         keystroke?      CMN: In Opera, there are a lot of single-key ways to access         functionalities ("F5") and Lynx.       IJ: I don't think "Alt-F" is single key.      CMN: Tricky on a smaller keyboard like Intellikeys or switching         devices.       DB: What need are we meeting?       JG: People with motor disabilities.       DB: Single key can be tricky since so few keys. What can't         Bryan do with current browsers?       KB: Opera allows him to jump from header to header with a single         letter key.        CMN: Or link to link in IE or Lynx.       CMN: You need to be able to configure access. You may have          a strong need to include single key access.        IJ: That's what the current checkpoint 10.3 currently says.        IJ: I think EH misunderstood the checkpoint text and          based on that, I propose that we leave as is.            From EH's comments:               I feel that the _requirement_ for single-stroke             changing of configuration is too restrictive.            We didn't mean that configuration had to be single          stroke but rather that one be able to activate          important functionalities with a preferred keystroke.        Resolved: Leave as is.         Issues #7/#8:  Break checkpoint 6.1 into two separate checkpoints -  6.1.A               and 6.1.B.         IJ: I understand this to mean "UA developers should implement          what WCAG tells them to do."        KB: The "until user agents".        IJ: We already cover all the "until UA" clauses in other          checkpoints.        MRK: Having a generic checkpoint means less maintenance over time.         IJ: I have some problems with future-looking checkpoints.           "I can't forgive you for things you haven't done yet."            (Elvis Costello).         DB: How can I miss you if you won't go away?         CMN: If you can't live without me, why aren't you dead yet?            /* End country western quotes */         DP: If there will be a later version of UAGL, wouldn't it           be better to evolve in a new draft?        CMN: The ATAG does both: we say "Do what WCAG says." This           ensures modularity. You don't want to have to            change one document everytime every other one changes.           I think a new checkpoint is not a bad idea in principle.           But you don't want to write too many blank checks to           other working groups.         JG: Is a redundant checkpoint a problem?         Resolved: Action Ian to work with Eric on a proposal.    Issue #11: Change "closed captions" to "captions" throughout the             document.         MRK: I think the change is ok. We would need to define it.             JG: Any objections?         Resolved: Use "caption". In definition of caption, make clear that                 in context, may refer to table captions not                 accessibility captions.    More minor:   -  "Braille" or "braille"?          GR: Capital "B" is the convention in print since derived           from a proper name, although lowercase "b" also used.           I think uppercase "B" would stand out more. Websters           prefers capital "B".         IJ: My issue is inconsistency with WCAG. Websters online           shows small "b" preferred.         Resolved: uppercase "B" is chosen since no objections.     - Issue #13: Is braille accepted as a natural language?           GR, CMN: No.           IJ: What about contractions?          GR: Braille is an abstraction. There are implementations            with contractions.          Resolved: Remove from defn of natural language.     - Is braille also haptic?       CMN: Yes. But refer to Al's comments.     Issue #16. Eliminate the use of  "continuous equivalent track".       IJ: EH proposes "synchronized equivalent" instead.     IJ: Fits with WCAG. Any important info other than the                         the synchronized part?    MRK: I prefer "continuous" since it captures time-dependency.     DP: I prefer "continuous" as well.     JG: This refers to alternatives, you would want the         content synchronized.       Action IJ: Take "synchronized equivalent" to SYMM WG.    Issue #17. Simplify checkpoint 2.5.       JG: We use "rendered" consistently.          Resolved: Add "relevant". Use of "synchronized equivalent"               pending SYMM WG feedback.    Issue #18. Handle "on the fly" auditory descriptions.             This is a proposed new checkpoint to mirror WCAG 1.3       IJ: EH wants a requirement to render text to speech within         a year of a W3C spec on that topic.       MRK: In what language?       CMN: I don't think we should require this.            DB: I think the expectation is that the system as a whole           will do this and the UAs will take advantage of those          capabilities.       MRK: Does spoken text have to be synchronized? It's not easy          to synchronize auditory descriptions. How do you synchronize          automatically?       CMN: This is very techniquey, but if your text if synchronized          already, you can use that.        MRK: But text sync is different than audio since you have          to mix different audio tracks.       MRK: My problem is that WCAG doesn't make sense because           of the difficulties of synchronization.        IJ: Two options:        a) WCAG is wrong        b) "User agents" in WCAG doesn't necessarily mean            mainstream browsers. Therefore, since UAGL             not catering to all user agents, no need today            for an additional checkpoint.        c) Also, if you already support text to speech, your           UA will already be required to render the text           equivalent as speech.       Resolved: No additional checkpoint.      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      Hi folks,    Great work on the AUGL everyone!     My comments on [1] are primarily editorial.   First, the more substantial ones:    Non-editorial:    1) The rationale text at the end of Guideline 1     ends on a warning of what bad may happen.      I recommend adding a sentence to indicate how     to handle this situation. (No proposal yet.)    2) Checkpoint 1.1: Propose changing the word      "implement" to "carry out" or something else since     implement sounds like coding to me.     3) Checkpoint 2.2: Propose changing beginning     from "Ensure that markup is generated"      to "Generate markup". There are other checkpoints     (e.g., 3.1) in which the imperative verb     refers to what the tool should do (and not just     what the tool designer should do).    4) Checkpoint 2.3: Propose changing beginning     from "Ensure the tool produces" to "Produce".     What about changing it to "Produce      content in a markup language that enables     accessibility"?    5) Checkpoint 3.2: Remove the examples from the     checkpoint text and put them in the comment that     follows. They make the checkpoint text difficult     to read.    6) Move the note at the end of Guideline 4 rationale     to Guideline 2. It concerns valid markup, which     is addressed by checkpoint 2.2    7) Checkpoints 5.1/5.2:        I think they should only be priority 2. I think       that they are important to accessibility, but       not essential.    8) Checkpoint 7.3: I don't understand this checkpoint.         "Render an accessible equivalent of each          element property." Could this be restated          as "Ensure that each element's properties          are accessible."?    9) Definition of "Transformation". Why does the     definition include "equivalent"? That seems     incorrect to me. It may be equivalent, but      doesn't have to be.    10) Definition of "Transformation". The definition      says that Transformation also describes the      Substitution of textual equivalents. I'd prefer      using the term "Substitution" here instead of      "Transformation".    Editorial:    0) Global     0.a) Ensure that checkpoints end with one period. Some          end with zero, others with two.     0.b) Ensure that "Web site" is two words     0.c) Capitalize "Techniques Document".     0.d) Change "meet a checkpoint" to "satisfy a checkpoint".     0.e) Capital D in "Double-A". Capital T in "Triple-A".     0.f) Capitalize "R" in W3C Recommendation.    1) Header     1.a) Need space between month and year    2) Introduction (Section 1.)     2.a) May need to define WYSIWYG somewhere.     2.b) Fifth bullet: change to "tools that generate          Web sites dynamically..."     2.c) Change "Thus the goals of this document can          be stated as follows" to "Thus, the goals          of this document are:"     2.d) "This document provides guidelines for          designing authoring tools..." I think that          "This document" is ambiguous and should be          changed to "The present document".     2.e) The term "checkpoint" appears in the introduction          but has not been defined yet. I propose changing          occurrences of "checkpoint" to "guideline" in          the Intro. The term "guideline", though not defined          yet, is used comfortably beforehand.            3) How the Guidelines are organized. (section 1.1)      3.a) Remove the period from the heading itself    3.b) "This document includes guidelines which". Put         a comma after guidelines.    3.c) Change "meet a checkpoint" to "satisfy a checkpoint"    3.d) Proposed change to penultimate paragrahp in 1.1:            <BLOCKQUOTE>         The Techniques Document suggests implementation         strategies and includes references to pertinent         guidelines and specifications. The techniques         in that document are informative only and not          exclusive of other strategies that may          also satisfy the checkpoints.         </BLOCKQUOTE>    4) Checkpoint priorities (Section 1.2)    4.a) Put a period after the three numbered list items.    5) Guideline 3       5.a) The last sentence is too long. Propose rewriting         as follows (starting with "Where" in the         original text):           <BLOCKQUOTE>         Tools should determine this type of information         mechanically where possible (e.g., ...). They         should suggest this information to the author but         allow the author to edit or change it in order         to guarantee its applicability. This type of prompt         will facilitate authoring and remind the author          of the importance of equivalent information.         </BLOCKQUOTE>            5.b) Checkpoint 3.4: Remove comma after "objects".    6) Guideline 7       6.a) Put a comma after "In order to edit a document"          (third paragraph).       6.b) Propose rewrite to last sentence of the           rationale (which seems unclear and unduly          passive):            <BLOCKQUOTE>          For instance, authors will benefit from           a structured view of the document that          provides an overview of the contents          and facilitates their navigation.          </BLOCKQUOTE>       6.c) Checkpoint 7.2: In comment afterwards,          delete "their" and the comma after          "requirements".    7) Terms and definitions.      7.a) Prompts. The terms "author" and "user" are         both used and that may be confusing.      7.b) Authoring Tool. Section "1.3" no longer         exists.      7.c) Accessible/Accessibility. Put those two         terms in quotes in the definition.      7.d) Some (but not all) of the "DD" elements in this         DL list are followed by blank lines in the         printed version. Remove extraneous <P> or <BR>         elements.      7.e) Accessibility Solution. Don't capitalize         "Authoring" in "Authoring practices".    8) References      8.a) Put a cmoma after McCathieNevile in          [WAI-AUTOOLS-TECH].    Cheers,      - Ian    P.S.

      Hello,    I'm glad to see that there's interest in the project  described below. I propose the following:    1) The XML and DOM groups converge on a common DTD for     their specs (at least a common core). Eve has said that     she has little time at the moment but is interested. Philippe,     I propose that you and Eve coordinate on this.    2) Once we have that core format, we figure out how to map     xhtml to it with an xslt style sheet. I suspect that     some of the transformations will be quite lightweight      (e.g., transform the first H1 of the document into the      title element of the common format). We obviously need     to document the conventions, ensure that available templates     conform to them, etc.       David Carlisle has volunteered some time in a few weeks and     I would be happy to participate in that discussion. I'm happy     to schedule a phone meeting, say the week of 14 August. For     example, 15 August at 2pm ET.     This would already be a good start.

      Hello,    I've published the 18 August 2000 draft of the UAAG 1.0 [1] and  UAAG 1.0 Techniques [2] documents. The list of changes [3]  is available online and quoted in text below.    Some of the change have not yet been reviewed by the Working  Group, namely:     - The changes in conformance wording in 3.2 and 3.3   - The definition of "recognize"   - Checkpoints 4.1-4.4, 7.6, 2.3, and 2.5. The other changed     checkpoints should not be too surprising. I've changed     11.1 to make a clarification, but open issue 310 deals     with this checkpoint.    Enjoy,     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818  [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000818  [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html#WD-UAAG10-20000818    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783    =======  CHANGES  =======      Versions [5]WD-UAAG10-20000818 and [6]WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000818          [5] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818        [6] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000818      General changes         * I moved some sections around to try to bring the guidelines  closer         to the top of the document. The primary change was to move the         section on conformance to section 3. I moved the Acks to after  the         references based on IETF conventions. I moved the information on         the structure of the guidelines to the beginning of section 2. I         moved the informationon related resources to immediately after  the         table of contents.       * I added some LINK relationships to the beginning of the document         that provide recognizable information about alternative formats.       * I switched the order of the editors' names based on discussion         with Jon Gunderson.       * Introduced notion of "responsibility" in introductory prose.      Changes to Checkpoints         * Checkpoint 2.3: Updated per [7]chair resolution of 2.3       * Checkpoint 2.5: Updated based on [8]17 August resolution to         [9]issue 295.       * Checkpoints 4.1 - 4.4: Updated based on [10]proposal from Ian per         [11]27 July teleconf. ([12] issue 290).       * Checkpoint 7.2: Updated per [13]editorial change proposed by Ian         based on [14]chair resolution of 7.2. (This is the wording from         the previous version).       * Checkpoint 7.6: Added list of important elements per resolution  of         [15]3 Aug teleconf ([16]issue 303 and [17]issue 299).       * Checkpoint 8.6: Updated per [18]chair resolution of 8.6  ([19]issue         300).       * Checkpoint 8.7: Deleted per resolution of [20]3 Aug teleconf.       * (Old) Checkpoint 9.4: Deleted per resolution of [21]10 Aug         teleconf ([22] issue 305).       * (New) Checkpoint 9.4: Changed percentage back to proportion based         on [23]3 Aug teleconf. Added note that horizontal position         information applies as well. ([24] issue 304 and [25]issue 302).       * Checkpoint 11.1: Added clarification that minimal requirement is         Level-A conformance. However, refer to [26]issue 310.

Chris says that the CSS requirement is not just for the  text. So for the SVG case, CSS will cover other parts  of an SVG object.

      Hello,    Below is a proposal to address issues 394, 359, 358, 322, and 321.   It consists of four parts:    ===========================================================  I.   Modifications to checkpoints 2.1 and 2.3  II.  Modifications to checkpoints 2.6 and 2.7  III. Definition of "optional content"  IV.  Sketch of changes to definitions related to WCAG 1.0.  ===========================================================    Reference document: 26 Jan 2001 Guidelines     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010126  Issues list:   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html    Notes on consensus among Al, Eric, and Ian about this proposal:    a) We agreed on Part I (the most important part of the proposal).    b) We have not formally agreed on the other parts, though we have     discussed all of them at some point. I think that any      differences of opinion about Parts II and III would be     minor.    c) Our discussions about definitions imported from WCAG 1.0     ("equivalent", "text element", "text equivalent") ceased when     we realized that the substance of our discussions lay at the     checkpoint level. Therefore, Part IV is only a sketch of how     the document's definitions will need to be modified. The     editors need to do more work on this, but the changes should     only be editorial at this point (all the substantial issues     now being addressed by Part I).    -------------------------------  Part I: Modifications to checkpoints 2.1 and 2.3  -------------------------------    The first part of this proposal replaces checkpoints 2.1 and 2.3  with four checkpoints. These checkpoints represent several ideas:    1) Not all content is rendered at all times.  Automatic decision about     when to render "optional content" is preferred, but manual decision  by     the user may be required.    2) Structure is preferred (both the author's specified preferences and     the user's structured access), but unstructured access may be     required.    3) Rendering according to specification is preferred, but a source     view of text content may be required (e.g., because of user-side     error conditions, authoring errors, inadequate specification,     or incorrect user agent implementation). For example, the user     may have to look at URIs for information, HTML comments,     XML element names, or script data.    4) Local control of rendering is important; global configuration of     rendering preferences is convenient.    -----------  Checkpoints  -----------    Taken together, these four checkpoints are designed to ensure  access to all content.    a) For format specifications that the user agent implements, make      content available through the specified rendering process.      [Priority 1]                Note: The specified rendering process will also account for        format-defined interactions between author preferences and user        preferences/capabilities (e.g., the "alt" attribute, the        rendering order of nested OBJECT elements in HTML, test        attributes in SMIL, and the cascade in CSS). If a conforming        user agent does not render a content type, it should allow the        user to specify a way to handle that content (e.g., by launching        another application, by saving it to disk, etc.).    b) For text formats that the user agent implements, provide a      view of the text source. [Priority 1]        Note: Text formats include:        (1) all media objects given an Internet            Media Type of 'text' (e.g., text/plain, text/HTML, or            text/*), and        (2) All SGML and XML applications regardless            of Internet Media Type (e.g., HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, SMIL,            SVG, etc.).        The user agent should provide a source view for any        text format, not just implemented text formats.    c) Allow configuration so that, for each piece of unrendered content     "C" that, by specification, is intended for the user through the     user interface, the user agent alerts the user to the existence of     the content and provides access to the content. Provide access to     this content according to specification or where unspecified,     as follows:         (1) If C has a close relationship (e.g., C is a summary, title,       alternative, description, expansion, etc.)  with another piece of       rendered content D, do at least one of the following:          (a) render C in addition to D,           (b) provide access C by querying D, or          (c) allow the user to follow a link to C from the context of D.         (2) Otherwise, do at least one of the following:          (a) render a placeholder for C that may be replaced by C,           (b) provide access to C by query              (e.g., allow the user to query an element for its             attributes), or          (c) allow the user to follow link in context to C.     [Priority 2]          Note: This checkpoint requires "element level" user control of        rendering. However, the configuration requirement is global;         the user may wish to turn off manual control entirely.        The specified rendering process will also account for        format-defined interactions between author preferences and user        preferences/capabilities (e.g., the rendering order of        nested OBJECT elements in HTML, test attributes in SMIL,        and the cascade in CSS).     d) For content that is rendered under well-defined conditions,      allow the user to configure the user agent to create those      conditions.     [Priority 3]    --------  Comments  --------    Comment 1) Proposed checkpoint (c) is only a Priority 2  checkpoint.  This is because checkpoints (a) and (b), both  Priority 1, ensure access to all content. Checkpoint (c) provides  for in-context, manual access to content (that, when selected, is  rendered "according to specification" per checkpoint (a), or  through one of the specified mechanisms).    Comment 2) The term "equivalent" has been deleted from the  preceding checkpoints. Here's why: a format specification  includes markup features that may be used for a number of  purposes, including for the provision of equivalents per the  requirements of WCAG 1.0. The proposed checkpoints require the  user agent to make available all optional content to the user.  Some of the time, authors will have used those features to  provide equivalents.    Comment 3) The term "equivalent" should be replaced by "optional  content" in a number of other places in the document. For  instance:      a) The subhead under Guideline 2 needs editing to talk       about optional content, not equivalents.         <OLD>       Ensure that users have access to all content, notably      recognized equivalents such as text equivalents and       auditory descriptions.        </OLD>        <NEW>      Ensure that users have access to all content, including      optional content that may be provided to meet the      requirements of WCAG 1.0.        </NEW>      b) The prose of Guideline 2 needs editing as well, to convey      the staged access model and to use the term "optional content"      instead of equivalents.      c) Change "equivalents" to "optional content" in the following      Guideline 4 note: "The checkpoints in this guideline apply to      all content, including equivalents."      d) Do similar changes elsewhere in the Guidelines and in the       Techniques Document as well.    -------------------------------------------------  Part II: Modifications to checkpoints 2.6 and 2.7  -------------------------------------------------    Checkpoints 2.6 and 2.7 should be likewise modified to use the  concept of "optional content" instead of "equivalents".    <NEW 2.6>   Allow configuration to generate repair text when the user   agent recognizes that the author has failed to provide required   optional content. If the optional content is associated with   other content rendered by default, and that content is   included by URI reference, base the repair text on the URI   reference and content type. Otherwise, base the repair text on   element type information.    </NEW 2.6>    <NEW 2.7>   Allow configuration so that when the author has intentionally   provided empty optional content, the user agent generates no   repair text or generates repair text as required by checkpoint   2.6.  </NEW 2.7>    -------------------------------------------------  Part III: Definition of optional content  -------------------------------------------------    Optional content is content that the author does not intend the  user agent to render by default, but that the author does intend  to make available to the user through the user interface under  certain conditions. Some mechanisms for providing optional  content include the "alt" attribute and the OBJECT element in  HTML, and the test attributes of SMIL 1.0 and SMIL 2.0.    The rendering semantics (when and where) of optional content may  be well-defined in some cases (e.g., "alt" and OBJECT in HTML)  and less well-defined in others (e.g., "title" in HTML).    Note: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 requires that  authors provide text equivalents for non text content. This is  generally done by using the optional content mechanisms of a  markup language.    -----------------------------------------------------  Part IV: Changes to definitions imported from WCAG 1.0           and modified for UAAG 1.0.  -----------------------------------------------------    Checkpoints 2.4 and 4.6 use the terms captions, text transcript,  and collated text transcript, which themselves use text  equivalent, text element, equivalent, and text.    Checkpoint 1.3 uses the terms non-text element and text  equivalent, but applied to the user interface, not content.    How can we harmonize usage of these terms between content  and user interface?    ROUGH PROPOSAL:     a) Use the current definitions of text, captions, text      transcripts, and collated text transcripts.     b) Text element:     <DFN>   As used in this document a "text element" either   adds text to content or to the user interface. Both in    WCAG 1.0 and this document, text elements are presumed to   produce text that can be understood when rendered visually,    as speech, or as Braille.     A text element may consist of both text and non-text data.  A   user agent may have to process a text element in order to have   access to the text characters. For instance, a text element may   consist of markup, it may be encrypted or compressed, or it may   include embedded text in a binary format (e.g., JPEG).     </DFN>     c) Non-text element:     <DFN>    A "non-text element" is an element in content or the    user interface that does not have the qualities of a text    element.   </DFN>     d) Text equivalent:     <DFN>     "A text equivalent is an equivalent created by one or more      text elements."   </DFN>     e) Equivalent: Use the WCAG 1.0 definition.    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

"Their DOM" is not the same as "The DOM" (meaning the W3C DOM).  Therefore,  despite the good design idea of making the system platform independent,  by not using system conventions or a recognized API, the design causes  assistive technologies to lose. Consistency among the interfaces  offered by the particular user agent across different platforms may  be less important than consistency among different pieces of software  on a given platform.    Perhaps the checkpoints are flawed or behavior in the case of  overlap is underspecified. Consider these three requirements:      1) Implement system conventions (checkpoint 5.2 of [1])    2) Implement the W3C DOM (checkpoint 5.6)    3) Implement your own, accessible and open API (checkpoint 5.1).        NOTE: I'd like to review what 5.1 means exactly.    Mozilla seems to be doing 3 at the expense of 1. Is there a  way to map Mozilla's API to MSAA on Windows?     This seems like a real issue where developer and AT input would  be very useful.     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105      > The conclusion of the meeting was that the User Agent guidelines should  > allow for cross-platform accessibility through DOM 2 as a minimum since  > this will utimately be a W3C standard providing the solution provider can  > clearly define how an assistive technology would interact with the DOM to  > provide an accessible solution.

      Hello,    In the 9 March 2001 draft [1], checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, and   4.15 were birthed from checkpoint 4.13 of the 24 Feb draft [2].  T.V. Raman pointed out to me that in doing so, we dropped the  reference to the CSS2 specification of aural cascading style  sheets [3]. He recommended that we return to using  the terminology of the CSS2 specification.    I propose to re-adopt the CSS2 terminology as follows:    For checkpoint 4.15:    speech-rate and voice-family    For checkpoint 4.14:    pitch, pitch-range, stress, and richness     For checkpoint 4.15   speak (in particular the 'spell-out' value),   speak-numeral, and speak-punctuaion    Please let me know whether this grouping of the CSS properties  corresponds to your expectations of the checkpoints as written:    4.13 Allow configuration of speech characteristics according        to the full range of values offered by the       speech synthesizer.    4.14 Allow configuration of speech prosody (i.e., pitch,        pitch range, stress, and richness).    4.15 Provide support for user-defined extensions to the       speech dictionary, spell-versus-say functionality,       number read-out functionality, and punctuation read-out       functionality.     Thank you,     - Ian    P.S. I think this is editorial.

Hi Neal,    First of all, the UA Guidelines require (checkpoint 2.1  in the 20 December draft [0])  that the user have access to all content,   including all alt and title text. Beyond  that requirement, there are techniques for making this  information available. From the 20 December Techniques [1]:    <BLOCKQUOTE>  Users should be able to:          Configure what information about links they wish presented to  them.   </BLOCKQUOTE>    There is also information about providing alternative informtion  (alt, title, etc.). Please review this section of the Techniques  document - we welcome your comments and suggestions.     - Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991220  [2]  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991220/#link-techniques     > Thanks for your comments.  >   > Neal Ewers  > Trace Research and Development Center  > 5901 Research Park Blvd.  > Madison, WI 53719  > Phone: (608) 263-5485  > FAX: (608) 262-8848  > E-mail:  ewers@tracecenter.org  > Web site: http://www.trace.wisc.edu    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

The current UAAG 1.0 only covers  foreground/background      colors for text and not for graphical objects such as splines. Here's  why I don't     think we should address this issue at this time: we have not had any  discussions     at all about the usability or accessibility requirements of  overriding colors for     portions of images or graphics. I don't think we should attack a new  problem 10     days before going to last call. It can wait until another version.    2) SVG colors can be specified with CSS style sheets and so allow user  override of     author and user agent defaults.      - Ian    > At 10:24 PM 10/5/2000 -0400, Al Gilman wrote:  > >[Len, Bruce: the reference thread is at  > >  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/thread.html#4 ]  > >  > >According to Bruce Bailey's report  > >  > >   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000OctDec/0012.html  > >  > >if you can force the text up in size you have solved the P2 problem.

GR: In my post on NOFRAMES, I quoted the HTML 4.0 spec:          (talks about configured not to display frames).       DP: What do we lose if we don't allow write access to the         full core spec?       JG: Not clear.         DP: What about "Begin Table/End Table"? Are those written         in the document tree by the AT, or added by the AT?       IJ: If they are walking the DOM (and not getting info from         graphical rendering), then don't need to write. AT can         prepend itself.       Resolved: Split 5.1 into:       a) Read-only for XML/HTML DOM 2 core       b) Write for ui controls provided through content.       Action Ian:        - Make this change.       - Add a cross-reference from 2.1 to 5.1 and say in         5.1 that this is a special case of 2.1    4) Issue 194     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#194       Proposed:        1. Only for synchronized multimedia        2. Includes both space and time       DP: Problem of streaming media. It's possible for downloadable         media.        IJ: I think that the applicability clause and a comment in the         techniques document could clear this up.       DP: If a multimedia presentation stops when you leave the page,         then you should be able to return to it.        IJ: I don't know why disorientation doesn't apply to multimedia.       GR: I agree.        Resolved:       - Add an examples of multimedia/time to "point of regard"       - Add a technique for multimedia tools about:         a) If the presentation stops when you leave a presentation,            bookmark and return. Distinguish running in "background"            from paused.         b) Comment about inapplicability for streamed media.       Action Ian: Add these to techniques document.    5) Issue 195     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#195       JG: Question of what exactly is meant by 1.5. Is this a UI         checkpoint or an API checkpoint?       Proposed 1) Ensure that user agent-initiated messages to the                 user are available through all output channels                 supported through the UI.             Proposed 2) Provide a text-equivalent in the user interface                 for every non-text user interface component.                  (Based on WCAG 1.1).       DA: What about the case where the UA emits a beep?       JG: Message on the status bar.       IJ: Components work in tandem: the sum of the components         around a given functionality must be accessible together         (and have a text equivalent).       GR: Problems of access to colors.        IJ: Not a problem: Either text is there for everyone, or         you can query. But you can't make the color alone accessible         to all people.       Proposed 2) Ensure that every functionality available through the                 user interface is represented in the user interface                 as text.        DB: For IE colors, nicknames should be available for main colors.            MQ: Allow users to name colors that they create....       Proposed 2) Ensure that every functionality available through the                 user interface is represented in the user interface                 as text.        IJ: Note that I'm talking about functionalities. Also, note that         that text needn't be available at all times; just available         at some time.       RS: What about basic colors?       JG: What if we scale this back to messages.       IJ: Note that we push to P2 the general case of user interface in  5.6.          Do Windows guidelines talk about text equivalents of non-text         controls?       DB: Yes, talks about item names.       Questions:        - How much has to be available through the UI?        - Just for messages? For all UI components?       - Does text meet the expectations of the WG?          DP: The reason we talked about messages was that they are         transient. Maybe not available through an API.             Resolved:       Ensure all non-text messages (e.g., prompts, alerts, etc.)        available through the user interface are also represented        in the user interface as text.        Action Ian:       - Ensure that techniques for this checkpoint talk about status bar.       - Incorporate proposal.       - Add rationale: if you're deaf blind you might need this         (Braille display).    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814 or 212 532-4767  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783

      10 October 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Ian Jacobs (Chair)   Tim Lacy   Charles McCathieNevile   Eric Hansen   Gregory Rosmaita    Regrets:     Kitch Barnicle    David Poehlman    Absent:     Jim Allan   Rich Schwerdtfeger   Harvey Bingham   Mickey Quenzer    Next meetings: 12 October. Regrets TL.    TL: If you don't here from me by 14 October, I'm ok to        go to last call.    Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0042.html    Minutes of previous meeting 28 September:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0493.html    Review Action Items    Announcements        1. FTF meeting update and call for participation         16-17 November.             Confirmed: JG, IJ, DP, HB, JA (phone), probably                        someone from Microsoft, probably                       someone from AOL              Regrets: CMN, KB, Lake Rocca, Glen Gordon, Mark Novak               Maybe : DA, HR, RS, AG, EH           JG: No objections to having the meeting then.           CMN: I could make a december meeting.          Action JG and IJ: Ensure that we have enough people committed        to attend the meeting. IJ put up meeting page.          Action TL: Find out whether definitive yes from Microsoft.        2. Taking measures to reduce spam          IJ: I requested a change to the mailing list.        3. XHTML 2.0 requirements to PF WG?          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0003.html        4.Please review list of invited last call reviewers        http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/09/reviewers-last-call-2.html        Action GR: Request Dolphin review        Action TL: Request Microsoft Multimedia group review    Discussion        1.Last call scheduling issues        IJ: Attempting to go to last call 19 October.        GR: I have only gotten a copy of the document since Saturday. I      doubt I will have a chance to review the whole thing by Thursday.        Resolved:          - Delete redundant parts of 10.5 w.r.t. 10.4.        GR: Missing from this is a pass-through requirement when conflicts          occur.        JG: Pass-through is covered by AT.        IJ: WCAG and ATAG has committed to last call review.        3.Issue 318: Scaling vector graphics content like SVG         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0497.html        Status: Looks to complicated to add any new information for this  version        Refer to thread:         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0004.html        JG: There are a number of complicated issues, and WCAG has just      started to example SVG accessibility. I propose that we do not try      to address this in UAAG 1.0.        GR: At the Bristol meetings, we discussed SVG techniques and have      some UA issues.       CMN: I intend to send them to the UA list. I'll be dining with SVG     people next week. I don't think we should specifically include new     SVG requirements at this stage. However, I think we should go as     far as we can in the existing document (techniques in particular).       JG: We don't have SVG implementation experience. This makes it     harder to "skip" Candidate Rec period.       IJ: We don't have any requirement for non-text objects (e.g.,     lines) outside of what you can do with style sheets.          GR: Important to note that alt text needs to be stylable.         Problems: control of size, clipping.           Resolved:        - Do not add additional requirements for SVG to UAAG 1.0.        - Mention SVG in note after checkpoint 4.1.       JG: Anyone may submit SVG techniques for current checkpoints.       EH: I think that it's important to document rationale for this         decision, why out of scope.       IJ: E.g.,        1) We think that this is an important topic, but lack         implementation experience.      2) Some requirements are already covered.      3) We haven't considered to date and we want to go to last         call without opening a new topic at this point.       4.Issue 319: Adding a GUI label for conformance       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0009.html       IJ: I am afraid to use an acronym such as "GUI". GR has said     he doesn't want to use "Graphical" as a label. What about "Basic"?        JG: Tim, do you think such a label would be useful?       TL: I am not sure whether an additional label is useful or not.       Resolved:        - Add another abbreviation label "Basic":                   Text, Color, Image, Animation       - Adopt corrected lists of checkpoints from Jon       5.Issue 320: Adding a checkpoint on ignoring position markup to  support        authors in creating content that transforms gracefully       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0008.html              IJ: Would "break" HTML specifications,          JG: We have implementation experience.        CMN: I think that this is an attempted repair functionality.        I don't see the argument for making it a checkpoint.         JG: Useful for people to test linearization of tables.         GR: I would support such a requirement. I'd also suggest that       that tables be deprecated in XHTML 2.0 (since presentation only).       I think that this is useful for people who don't know about Lynx       or who don't know about tablin.         IJ, CMN: We disagree with the latter statement.         TL: I don't think this functionality belongs in the user agent.         CMN: As repair techniques go, this is not a great one. It would       make more sense to include a table linearizer.          Resolved: Resolved: Since there is not unanimity about such       a requirement, and this issue wasn't raised in PR and Last Call,       no new requirement.         EH: We've had debates about whether linearized table should       count as a text equivalent. I think it can be classed as an       equivalent of some kind. I think we should include "linearized       table" as a class of equivalent for tables.         JG: That would be WCAG's responsibility.         EH: I'm ok with not saying that it's a text equivalent. But       an equivalent of some kind.       6. IJ Proposed for 8.7: Delete "identifying        (through a standard interface where available" from 8.7. So it       becomes "Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current viewport,       selection, and focus."         Action IJ: Send to list.

      Hello,     I received an action item at the 11 March teleconf [1]  to propose a checkpoint related to DTDs (and schemas) to  the list. Here is the wording based on our discussion during  the call:    Priority: 2    Text    : Create documents that validate to published formal             grammars.     Comment : For example, include a document type declaration             at the beginning of a document that refers to a             published DTD.       I am not sure how to work Schemas into the checkpoint without  it becoming unduly long. Perhaps we can mention schemas  in the techniques document?    All  suggestions welcome,       - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/meetings/19990311.html#actions  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

I suggest that we don't include this requirement at a P1 level  in UAAG 1.0 and rely on the fact that the author will also be  making some effort to convey hot spots on an image map.

      Reference Document:     http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990709/wai-autools-tech     Checkpoint 3.1:      a) Add Note about SMIL 1.0 accessibility features. To appear       soon.      b) Add link to UAGL Techniques, which will       have useful information for tool developers    Checkpoint 3.2:      a) I don't think the current techniques apply as       they are addressed by checkpoint 3.1 techniques.      b) Instead, add or refer to what is covered in the       section on Validation in WCAG 1.0 [1]. These are       techniques to help people create documents that conform.       Checkpoint 3.1 is about how to create accessible documents.          [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#validation    Checkpoint 3.3:      a) Same comment as above: I don't think the current       techniques apply as they are addressed by        checkpoint 3.1 techniques.      b) What distinguishes a template from a document that       would deserve special attention? Users must       be able to choose, fill out, edit a       template in a device-independent manner. I can't       think of much else right now.    Checkpoint 3.4:      I need more time to think about this one!     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel/Fax:                     +1 212 684-1814        

      Hello,     Checkpoint 9.1 in the 1 September draft [1] reads:       9.1 Ensure that when the selection or content focus changes,          it is in a viewport after the change. [Priority 2]     I propose that this checkpoint be for text or graphical renderings  only. I have trouble making sense of this requirement for audio  viewports. (What does "in" mean in that context?).     - Ian    [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000901/  --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783        

      19 September 2000 UA Guidelines Teleconference    Present:   Jon Gunderson (Chair)   Al Gilman   Ian Jacobs (Chair)   Harvey Bingham   David Poehlman   Kitch Barnicle    Tim Lacy   Eric Hansen   Charles McCathieNevile    Absent:   Rich Schwerdtfeger   Gregory Rosmaita   Mickey Quenzer    Regrets:   Jim Allan    Next meetings: 21 September, 26 September  Regrets for 26th: KB, HB, TL for half.     Minutes of previous meeting 14 September:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0387.html      Agenda:     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0392.html    Discussion:    1. All Group conference in February 2001. Refer to minute of      chairs meeting (Member only)      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/2000JulSep/0113.html        JG: How many people would be interested in attending such a       meeting?        Interested an can (hope to) go: HB, KB, AG, DP      Interested but can't go: TL        Action JG: Get back to Chairs and express interest. Suggest that      approximately 10 people would be going.    2.Issue 314: How to distinguish "important elements" (not just type?)   Comments from Al Gilman on 7.6         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0312.html    AG: I think that there are at least three issues:   a) First has to do with the notion of hierarchy and moving through      a hierarchy. I don't think the current 7.6 language gets that      across. It's alluded to in the Guideline prose. One way to      facilitate navigation is to break up chunks of content in smaller      pieces, in multiple phases. I don't think that 7.6 captures this      enough, and it's a piece that is known to be effective (e.g.,      digital talking book model).        b) I have a lot of trouble understanding how you can write a minimal      implementation requirement for navigation and for orientation       independently. Suppose that you filter out some information or      compute a table of contents. If you present that as an auxiliary      table of contents, there are no distinct navigation commands      (beyond switching viewports and following links). This would be      a conforming technique that would require no additional  functionality.     c) The orientation requirement can be slender if the user agent      provides more verbs.     AG: I think the basic profile for hierarchical navigation is next, up,  down relative to some tree. I think "back" is handy as well, but may  not be required for the minimum.    AG: Are the structurally important components of the page going to be  recognizable from the markup of the page? My current assessment of  technology is that they will not. There is no algorithm that will  operate effectively on element types and attributes on its own and  give you an effective navigation tree. I am reluctant to see something   this concrete in the document and it doesn't work. We don't want to  lose our credibility moving forward if it doesn't work.    AG: Hierarchical navigation is desirable, but is not in the current  7.6 language. The problem is that I don't think there's a way to get  there from the markup. I don't think we can claim it's a reasonable  demand on user agents. I don't have an algorithm to give to  developers. Deployed pages won't work. Even following WCAG might not  be sufficient to give clues to authors for using proper markup.  In that document, we don't tell UAs what to look for.    EH: I sympathize with the concern about requiring something where the  markup doesn't adequately support the goal. We also run into this for  equivalents. The markup specified in WCAG 1.0 doesn't fully support  identification of equivalency relationships. However, at a P2 level,  navigating among these elements seems relevant. There are different  models for showing, hiding, and filtering. I want to be convinced that   if we say navigation, that's what we mean, and we need to be sure that   that's what we want (people moving around). If that's what we want, I  don't see this as problematic at a P2 level.    TL: I think it's important that the UAAG 1.0 not require an  algorithm. The trick is obviously to determine the hierarchical  structure. I am not too concerned with a P2 requirement. I'd be  interested in seeing some implementation experience before we attempt  to define more than it is today.    CMN: ISO HTML is defined as having an implicit hierarchical   structure.    AG: In the ISO spec that CMN is referring to, there is a definition  of virtual DIV elements: for every header level there is a presumed  container.     AG: It's beginning to dawn on me that what 7.6 says is that the  list of elements must be reachable. The current 7.6 does not attempt  to provide a top-down breakdown of the document.    IJ: It would be possible to make the list informative and rewrite  the checkpoint more abstractly.    AB: Min requirement is a sliding scale according to how much  navigation or orientation you do.    IJ: It might be possible to push the orientation and navigation  requirements into a single checkpoint.     AG: 7.6 may be ok for what it says, but it doesn't capture the  structural requirement we want in the long term.    EH: Does "semantic" markup include "structural" markup?    IJ: I think this includes semantics defined by specification  as well as metadata.     EH: What about the relationship between semantics and style?  We probably shouldn't think of style as being a proper vehicle  for semantics.    CMN: But unless you allow navigation of it, a heap of what's deployed  will be unreadable. You may not be able to do anything unless you can  navigate according to style.    /* Chair asks if anyone is willing to propose an alternative     checkpoint. */    AG: I think that it's better to make the list informative.    IJ:    - One fear: direct exposure of the tree to users.   - What about changing the wording of 7.6 to be closer     to what AG has said (recursive breakdown of chunks).    AG: I don't want exposure of the full-blown tree, but rather "go to  the next thing like this".    TL: Would it be sufficient to navigate the DOM by adding next sibling?  (next sibling instead of depth-first).    JG: Recall: the DOM walk is not necessarily the best view of the  document. You want less than what's in the DOM.    CMN Proposes:   - Walking a DOM tree up and and down and sibling-to-sibling is one     way to do what we want. However, doesn't really work for HTML 4     (since headings not nested).     - This doesn't solve the table problem.    AG: The solution for the table is that the navigation grid is not a  tree within the table. It's an array.     TL: We work on table navigation a lot. Complex when you have   nested tables.    IJ: I think we decided a long time ago that table navigation would  not be a focus of this document. Please do not open that discussion  right now...    AG: I'd like to create an abstraction of the DOM tree and providing  motion in that tree that includes breadth-first navigation.     CMN: We don't have any other motion requirements. I think that not  being able to page backwards is a serious flaw and if I didn't have  it, I would throw my UA away.    AG: Eyes-free user is more dependent on indexed access.    CMN: I think forward navigation of the tree alone is not  enough. If you have to go back to the start of the tree each time, you   are throwing away context each time. This requires you to remember too  much. I would require up, down, left, right in the tree. The DOM tree  is one such tree. The implicit ISO HTML tree is another.     EH: For documents written in a book style (with nested subheads),  implicit DIVs are a useful technique. But there are a lot of Web pages   not constructed that way.    /* We note that WCAG talks about this without referring to ISO HTML:     "3.5 Use header elements to convey document structure and           use them according to specification. [Priority 2]"   */    EH: If we are assuming WCAG 1.0 conformance, we can write checkpoints  that assume this usage.    IJ Summarizing:    1) Make list of elements informative  2) Reword requirement based on top-down breakdown.  3) Movement requirement: top/down/left/right  4) Different DOMs are useful    Action CMN: Propose a new structured navigation checkpoint.

However, I don't think that it will address  one important goal of the guidelines - the promotion  of interoperability - to consider interprocess communication  an implementation issue. With interoperability in mind, I think  it is important to include at least one or two checkpoints about  communication between browsers and dependent user agents. I realize  that when we say "how" we generally should be talking about  the techniques document. But this is a case when I think a checkpoint  is necessary for compatibility.     > 2.

I don't believe it lies within the scope of these guidelines to  address programmatic control of the user interface (I don't think  it's appropriate to lump document content in with user interface.)  In fact, I think that the guidelines  shouldn't discuss the accessibility of the user interface at  all, with some exceptions:      - We should talk about device-independent operation of the UI.   - We should talk about the selection and the focus.   - We should talk about accessible formats for documentation   - We should talk about accessible communication between software.    We should not, in my opinion, say much or anything about  menus and buttons and the graphical user interface.    > b.

Most days, I consider these to be implementation issues. I agree that  they are important, but the DOM seems to be the "most underlying"   platform-independent open standard around - we don't have anything  else to propose that will promote interoperability.     > c.

It may be true that MSAA provides more functionality today and possibly  in the near future. And that it is more general than providing  access to HTML or XML documents. But it is not an open standard  and as such, makes it difficult for W3C to promote.      > So I would like to suggest five checkpoints for people to think about,  > criticize, modify and/or comment:    > ** The following checkpoints ae based on the assistive technologies point  > of view **  >   > Checkpoint 6.2.1 [Priority 1} Allow assistive technology to access  > information about the current user interface controls (windows, menus,  > toolbars, status bars, dialog boxes).  >   > Primary techniques: Accessibility APIs or use of operating system standard  > controls.    As I suggest above, I think that 6.2.1 lies outside the scope of these  guidelines as it concerns programmatic control of the user interface  and we should limit ourselves to access/control of document  content where possible.     > Checkpoint 6.2.2 [Priority 1} Allow assistive technology to simulate the  > selection and activation of user interface and document controls (windows,  > menus, toolbars, status bars, dialog boxes).  >   > Primary techniques: Accessibility APIs or use of operating system standard  > controls.    I don't think document controls are in the scope of these guidelines.  I do think it is helpful if dependent user agents can set the  selection/focus programmatically and set the style of the  selection/focus  programmatically (or through style sheets, though CSS2 doesn't allow  this).     > Checkpoint 6.2.3 [Priority 1] Allow assistive technologies to access  > information about the current information being rendered by the user agent.  >   > Primary techniques: Accessibility APIs that provide information on document  > rendering and/or DOM.

I agree with this checkpoint, but it sounds a lot like "Allow the  user to control the style of a document" which was slammed   a long time ago because of its generality. We split it into  fifteen or so individual checkpoints. Why shouldn't we do  the same when the actor is a dependent user agent rather than  the user?    I wish this checkpoint were covered by "Implement DOM 1", but  DOM 1 doesn't address style issues - that is the privilege of DOM 2.    This being the case, we can refer to other interfaces that  allow dependent user agents to control style information and  add that when a W3C Recommendation becomes available, it will  be the preferred interface.     That interfaces evolve is one argument for pushing everything  concerning inter-software communication into the techniques  document (and I have been tempted). But I think that for  the cause of interoperability, we should promote open interfaces  as checkpoints.     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

It reads: "For any element, provide easy access   to each of its alternatives through at least one of the following  mechanisms..."  Of a given set of elements, you can pick any one to start with and find  the others. But the checkpoint does not prejudice one choice over the  others.  It is in fact intended to be entirely symmetric. However, editorially,  it  is very hard to write the checkpoint other than singling one element out  (I tried and I am more satisfied with the formulation that reads: for  ANY element chosen by the user, ensure access to all of its  alternatives).      > in that various forms of unequal treatment are included in  > the  > list, any one of which is credited as meeting the checkpoint.  >   > There are many situations in W3C formats where the options are treated  > asymmetrically in the rules of the format.   > The ALT attribute and OBJECT  > element are conspicuous examples.

      Hello,    In light of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [1] use  of different levels to describe conformance (Levels A, Double-A  and Triple-A), I think the UA GL should use the same terminology.    Today, the conformance statement only talks about Level A (all  Priority 1 checkpoints) for either desktop graphical user  agents OR assistive technologies that depend on them.     Is there any reason not to describe the other levels?  Today we say in essence "You either conform to Level A or  not at all". We could allow user agents to conform  "even more" to Levels Double- and Triple-A.     -Ian      [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Telephone May 1999 only:     (212) 688-4489  Cell phone May 1999:         (917) 450-8783  Otherwise Tel/Fax:           (212) 684-1814

Refer to WCAG.       3.IJ: Send a detailed call for review to the IG.            Done.       4.IJ: In document, highlight existence of "native" and "applies           to".            For next draft.       5.HB, RS: Look at techniques document.           HB: Review of Techniques             http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0353.html           RS: Will send in comments on Techniques.       6.HB: Run pwWebSpeak (with Mark H.) through the guidelines.        7.DP: Technique 3.6 - Propose techniques        No.       8.DP: Run Jaws for Windows through the guidelines.        No.       9.GG: Review proposal for techniques for accessing content.        No info.      10.CMN: Write a proposal for moving forward on conformance to the       list.

Will send a list of tools that make use of meta information to the  list.        Done. Conclusion: Don't think we have a checkpoint-level            requirement at this stage.      14.JA: Compose list of metadata sources for CSS. (e.g., generated           text)        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0348.html      15.Marja: Compose list of metadata sources for SMIL.        Almost done.      16.JG: Include in RSVP a request for inidicating completion of action  items        Done.    Agenda 1) Review of AU last call.    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0207.html      HB: I sent comments about XML info.         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0212.html    IJ: I sent comments.         http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/1999JulSep/0211.html    DP: Have the AUGL been evaluated with real authoring tools?   CMN: Yes. We have authoring tool developers in the WG. We've done        conformance tests thoroughly with a couple of tools. We would        like to see more testing. The conformance test with Amaya        is part of the Techniques document.   CMN: I'd like to exclude Gregory, Ian, Jim from review since they        are intimately involved with the process.     CMN: We want:    a) A statement that the AU satisfies all needs of the UA Guidelines.    b) Review from anyone.      Action Jim, Kitch: Send list of dependencies between AU and UA WGs to        the AU and UA lists.      Gregory also says he will review the guidelines.    Agenda 2) Face-to-face/Last call.      Reminder: Sign up for UAGL face to face, 11-12 October at Microsoft.            http://www.w3.org/WAI/1999/10/ua-agenda      IJ: WAI Team met yesterday. Consensus to wait until        after face-to-face.      Resolved: Go to last call after the face-to-face meeting.            Action Ian: Find out about MS review of document before ftf                and their participation in the meeting.      Action Ian: Find out from Judy about NN attendance.      Action Ian: Find out from Judy about Operasoft attendance.                IJ: Will talk to H?kon Lie.      HB: Softquad's HotMetal.      Action JG: Compose list of assistive technology developers               for invitation to ftf.    Agenda 3) Conformance.      JG: I think that we require a third category for        specialized tools. Not designed for general        use. But we should still have something for        them in the document. A category for them        would resemble the dependent UA category.        For both of these types, we need to address        the issue of device-independence. I looked        at charter, which discusses interoperability,        but not necessarily between dependent UAs.      RS: Would another group require a major rewrite of the        document?      IJ: No.     CMN: But requires lots of thought...     CMN: My problem with the whole concept is that         if I target a particular market, but provide        a customizable browser, I don't have to        worry about interoperability. This is a         description of Netscape Navigator (Mozilla).        Their targeted audience is people using        a desktop graphical browser.       RS: I mean targetted for a particular        disability.     CMN: You can build lists that allow you to        compose lists to let you target whatever.      IJ: What about just re-examining the device        independent checkpoint, for example?        Just say that if you support a particular        API, you must do it accessibly.      KB: So same set of checkpoints, just different        definition of "applies to"?      IJ: Yes.      MN: I agree with Charles. I'm concerned about how        people will twist around the document.        Can we be more specific in the Techniques?      IJ: I think the Techniques are too informative.      RS: One part bugs me: communication between        dependent user agents. Targetted user agents        (e.g,. multi-platform) that try to meet        accessibility guidelines don't have resources        for doing communication when this is not their        targetted audience.     CMN: I have a problem saying a targetted tool        is an accessible user agent. They are        useful, but don't belong in this document.        Or at least conformance doesn't apply.      GR: I don't think targetted information should        be included in a general document. (Said this        last week). Also, the impact matrix will        be useful for targetted UAs to find out what        applies to different groups. I don't think        another subclassing will help.      JG: What about tweaking other definitions?      GR: More reasonable approach. I'd have to review        a concrete proposal. E.g., in the case of HPR,        the graphical view is available to the user        (on demand).      IJ: Recall this from UAGL (about native support):            "A user agent supports a feature natively if it              does not require another piece of software (e.g.,             plug-in or external program) for support."      RS: With HPR, you have several options for having        Netscape render info. HPR could be considered a dependent        user agent, but it targets a particular audience.      MK: I was thinking about device-independence. If the         dependent UA gives an interface for the information        (e.g., speech) then you can use the guidelines.        E.g., are we requiring UAs to provide a keyboard API?      DP: Most dependent UAs I know of allow multiple device input.        PwWebSpeak has more standard components available than HPR.        So I see HPR more as a screen reader for Netscape.     CMN: We're talking about a conformance statement that will allow        HPR, PWWebSpeak, etc. can conform. I think this is a mistake.      RS: I think it's unreasonable to ask ATs to support all the        other AT requirements. Dependent UAs are an enhancement,        providing secondary access.      IJ: I think including in this document will promote interoperability        even if people don't have to satisfy all the checkpoints.        Just being there will benefit developers.      RS: I propose variable priorities. E.g., Priority 2 for dependent UAs.            IJ: Note danger of saying "Don't have to do this since we        don't have resources." Can use that argument for not providing        accessible documentation.     CMN: This WG is not chartered for creating legal requirements.        Broad guidelines fit too many people and doesn't fit anyone        in the end. I like the variable priority approach.      RS: I'd hate to not encourage people to develop assistive        technologies because the interoperability requirements        are too strong.      JG: Seems to be consensus not to have more than two categories.      JA: There's no definition of graphical desktop browser or        dependent UA.    Action Ian: Propose list of checkpoints that are "sensitive"     (affect targetted UAs) and propose variable priorities/rewording     for them. (Look at HPR's evaluation.)    Action Jim: Propose definitions to the list.    Agenda 4) Configuration checkpoints.          http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0127.html     GR: Two checkpoints proposed (and list of techniques)      a) One for links: Allow user to configure what                            information about links is presented. [P1]       (Would replace 9.5 and 9.6 in 27 Aug draft).      b) One for form controls: Allow the user to view a                       list of FORM controls. [P1].      DP: I like merging a with 9.5 and 9.6.      IJ:        a) Rationale of 9.6 lost if merged with (a).       b) I don't think should be priority 1.      JA: Gregory has two checkpoints that he's rolled together        View, focus info available and configurability confusing.      GR: Then drop the second sentence from first proposed checkpoint.       About checkpoint 9.5:      GR: Make the dependency on micropayments more visible.      Action Ian: Make the dependency on micropayments more visible.      GR: I think that configurability is important, but also         need a maximum amount of information about links is important.        Propose 9.5 and 9.6 as P2.      Action Ian: Include GR's link checkpoint as P3 (configurability).                Change priority of 9.6 to P2.                Get techniques out of [1].    [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0127.html      Discussion of proposed checkpoint for FORM controls list:      IJ: I don't think should be P1.    GR: Then P2. Tabbing can be disorienting if you don't know tab        order.    IJ: How does list of form controls help?    JA: Helps when form is designed poorly (e.g., submit button        is followed graphically by other important controls).    DP: Would a correctly coded form require this information?    IJ: Example of submit button after other controls can be valid HTML.      Unresolved.

      Hello,    Several issues were raised during the 30 March   teleconference [1] and I'd like to try to summarize  them here. Please let me know if you think this  is an inaccurate or incomplete summary. The issues  are listed in no particular order.    Note: The proposals I make below I make in a vacuum.        The UA Guidelines are in Proposed Rec review        and any changes we make might require another        round of reviews. I'll ignore that fact for the        purposes of the discussion below. However, without        committing myself, I think that resolving Issues        2 and 3 could be considered clarifications rather        than substantial changes to the document.            Issue 1: What is the scope of checkpoint 2.1?       In the proposed rec [2], checkpoint 2.1 reads:         2.1 Ensure that the user has access to all content,                  including equivalent alternatives for content.       This checkpoint does not specify which content must     be made available through the user interface. While     people will rightly assume that some content will be     made available through the user interface, there is no     requirement that all content be made available through     the user interface. At the 2 March teleconference,     we discussed the option of modifying 2.1 to talk only     about making content available through the user      interface (to complement, rather than overlap with,     the requirement to make content available through      an API), but there was consensus not to change the      checkpoint.       Yesterday we also talked about reducing the scope of     2.1 to making "renderable" content available through     the user interface.        The document [2] does not include a requirement that     all alternative equivalents be available through     the user interface. Based on the resolution at the     2 March teleconference, Checkpoint 2.1 intentionally     does not make that requirement.       Proposal: Change checkpoint 2.1 to read: "Ensure that     the user has access to all alternative equivalents     through the user interface."       Problems with this proposal:         1) What will be lose by narrowing the scope from          "all content" to "alternative equivalents"? Are          there other parts of content that the user would          want that cannot be classified as equivalents?          (More on content generated by scripts below.)         2) How are equivalent alternatives specified in           a markup language? In HTML, there are many          elements that may be used to supply alternative          equivalents (alt, longdesc, summary, abbr,          MAP content that is not AREA, OBJECT content).            The case of NOFRAMES is a stubborn one because          the HTML 4 specification explicitly says not          to render NOFRAMES content when frames are          supported [4]:                "User agents that support frames must only display               the contents of a NOFRAMES declaration  when                       configured not to display frames."            You can argue that the HTML spec is wrong (or          needs clarification). We do not have a requirement          that user agents allow users to turn off frames.          We used to, but since it was argued that turning          off frames didn't really make sense, that           frames aren't inherently inaccessible, and that          access to NOFRAMES was possible through an API,          the requirement to be able to turn off frames was          dropped.  So the question is: is requiring a          user agent to render NOFRAMES even when it supports          frames a violation of checkpoint 6.2 (conform to          specifications)?     Issue 2: Does a source view satisfy checkpoint 2.1?       Phill Jenkins asked [5] whether a source view would     satisfy checkpoint 2.1.        I think it is difficult to conclude from the document     that a source view is not part of the user interface     (and in my opinion, a source view is part of the user      interface).       However, there seems to be consensus that a     source view does not satisfy 2.1     (whatever the outcome of Issue 1) because it does not     present content in a form that most people can actually     use. It is entirely unacceptable to expect a user to     read the binary format of a GIF image. It is less     unacceptable to expect a user to read the text that's      available in the middle of an HTML file, but that still     requires knowledge of the markup language that we     should not expect of users (whether or not they     have a disability).       Thus, there seems to be consensus that:       a) We are not requiring that user agents provide        a source view.       b) A source view would not satisfy 2.1       c) A source view is useful to some users.              Issue 3: What does "content" mean?      There seemed to be disagreement about the definition    of "content" in the Proposed Recommendation:          "In this document, content means the document source,          including its elements, attributes, comments, and other        features defined by a markup language specification such as        HTML 4.01 or an XML application. Refer also        to the definitions of rendered content and equivalent        alternatives for content."      This is distinguished from rendered content, whose    definition begins:            "Rendered content is the part of content that is         rendered after the application of style sheets,           transformations, user agent settings, etc."      In fact, the situation is even more complicated than    that. There seem to be more than two "layers":       - There is document source, which includes associated       style sheets, external content such as images,       and probably information communicated in HTTP headers.       - There is the document tree, which may include       content generated by scripts and transformations.       What about content generated or suppressed due       to user preferences (e.g., use "abbr" for table       cell headers instead of TH content)?       - There is the rendered content, which is what actually       gets presented to the user. In CSS, content generated       by style sheets is considered part of rendered content.       However, will DOM 3 include this as part of the DOM       tree? (I don't know enough about DOM 3 plans to        know this.)         I think "rendered content" is supposed to be "what the       user gets", which is how I heard some people using       "content" yesterday.      Hans refers to these three levels in his email of 31    March [6].      I invite people to suggest ideas for clarifying the various    states of content from source to DOM to viewport.

I propose the following wording:        4.1 Ensure that all information conveyed with color           is also available without color,          for example from context or markup. [Priority 1]                   When text has a purely decorative value                 and conveys no information other than the color                 itself, it is not necessary to provide that                 information elsewhere.      - Ian      --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   Tel/Fax: (212) 684-1814   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs

At first I thought you were quoting the Guidelines, but  you're quoting [1] (which is much easier for us to correct). I'll  fix it promptly.

That's up to you, actually. We put ours at the bottom generally,  as we did in the Guidelines themselves.    >  I am currently developing a site (not available  > yet) and would like to support the WAI but I cant see putting the logo on  > each page.    I think it would be fine to have a link (e.g, "Accessibility  Information"  or something similar) on the home page that designates a page   where you describe conformance of certain pages. You could  also put information there that would help users with disabilities  navigate  your site (e.g., if you have d-links you could explain that they're  present).     I haven't tried this yet, but it would be interesting to experiment  with such a page. My only concern would be separating information  for some users from information for all users. So, for instance,  I wouldn't put a site map on a page about accessibility information  since the site map (while useful to people with disabilities)  helps everyone.    > Is there perhaps a way that say "this section conformes to A" and  > "this section conforms to AA" ect with maybe a logo at the head of each  > section?    That kind of detail could go on a separate page, yes.    Thank you for your efforts. If you find any good design ideas for  addressing  these questions, please let us know. We are very interested in how the  guidelines are used and where they are weak in explanation.    Thanks again,     - Ian    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs        

      Hello,    Checkpoint 3.8 in the 18 August Guidelines [1] includes the  sentence "Advise the user to refresh content according to   the same schedule as the automatic refresh, and indicate   when the user has not yet refreshed content." The  term "prompt" appears in checkpoints 9.2 and 1.5. The terms  "alert" and "notification" are used in checkpoint 1.5.    I propose the following:    1) That we only use the term "notify" in the checkpoints and     that we define it to mean "inform the user through the user     interface". Note that I do not talk about APIs here. That     is a separate requirement (that messages through the UI also     be available through an API).    2) That "notify" be independent of a particular mechanism     in the user interface (but that any notification be     accessible).    3) That the term "prompt" be reserved for a particular     UI approach, but that we don't attempt to define it!     I would note that the AU Guidelines [2] includes a definition      of prompt, but since then, that WG has had a number of discussions     on the definition (refer to [3], [4], [5], and [6] at least).    4) In checkpoint 3.8, rewrite the sentence cited above to     be "Notify the user ..."    5) We could rewrite checkpoint 9.2 to not use the word prompt:         Allow configuration so the user can confirm any form        submission not caused by explicit activation of a        form submit control.       Otherwise, if we intend to use prompt to mean "the user     must intervene before anything else happens", we should     define it to mean that. I want to avoid having to     define it.    6) What techniques, if any, do we need for notification or     configuration of notification in general?       a) Configuration to have no notification.     b) Configuration to prompt the user and require input        before continuing.     c) Configuration to notify the user but without requiring        any input from the user.     - Ian       [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000818/  [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203/  [3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0199.html  [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0168.html  [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0073.html  [6] http://www.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2000AprJun/0080.html    --   Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)   http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  Tel:                         +1 831 457-2842  Cell:                        +1 917 450-8783
