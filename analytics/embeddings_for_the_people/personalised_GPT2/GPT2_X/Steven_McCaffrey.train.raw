      Hi Jim etal:         Yes, I agree, most puzzling.  If this is a JFW bug, which appears plausible at the moment, I hope it's fixed in the next release.  Thanks for the variations Jim!  The name attribute is apparently involved but not always required.  Are there preferences in terms of valid HTML4?      Steve    >>> thatch@attglobal.net 06/04/01 09:50PM >>>  Steve,    I am baffled. I was able to reproduce the problem with JFW 3.7U. It seems to  be the missing name attribute on your example. Yours is the third edit field  in http://jimthatcher.com/forms060401.htm (I moved it to third to be sure  being first wasn't causing the problem). Unfortunately, I removed the name  attribute from case 2 in my sample, and the prompt IS spoken by JFW. If I  add a name attribute to your example, then the prompt IS spoken. I removed  tabindex from your example with no effect on the speaking.    I don't know what the problem is, but it seems to be a JFW problem since at  least two other AT's (HPR and Window-Eyes) seem to have no problem.

      Hello Tyler:         Welcome to the list.  I use JFW and agree with the Section 508  guide for spacer images.  The idea is to not hear anything if the image is just a spacer.  I'm not sure about lists, I'd have to see the context.  You could use alt="bullet" perhaps.  I think alt is a required attribute of the IMG tag so it is not strictly speaking just for Bobby compliance.        Steve  ITS  NYSED    >>> Tyler Kendall <tyler_kendall@ncsu.edu> 06/28/01 10:36AM >>>  Hello all,        First, as I'm new to the list, a brief introduction: My name is  Tyler Kendall and I'm in charge of providing accessible web design  education, consulting, and review at NC State University.  "Hello!"        I'm hoping to get a consensus of what people feel is the 'best  practice' regarding the use of ALT tags for spacer images.  I have been  recommending using ALT=' ' and giving the file a meaningful name (like  'spacer.gif').  The new access board guide to Section 508  (http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm) is the first  place I've seen this officially recommended - though I recall seeing it  used once or twice in examples in other guides.      While this approach seems the best I've come across, I'm not  entirely pleased with it.  JAWS, the screen reader with which I have the  most experience, treats these images the same as images with no ALT tag  what-so-ever, and in many ways this seems to be a trick to get Bobby  approval.  Is there a better way to provide users of screen readers a  solution here?      On a similar note, I've been recommending the use of ALT='bullet'  for graphic list bullets (when people seem unwilling to use the HTML  list markup), but I'm wondering, does ALT='*' has much support?

        A very interesting discussion.  I am a senior programmer/analyst with the New York State Department of Education, am blind and use one of the latest versions of a screen review program.         First, I strongly agree with  "the Page AuthoringGuidelines really go over how to make your Web site more accessible without  having to completely sacrifice design...or maintain a completely seperate  text page. When Web developers hear accessibility, they think work. If you  think about it, it really isn't. If you're Web site is HTML 4.0  compliant....then you're most of the way there to being Accessible."    I would just like to add my voice to these excellent points.  Yesterday, I gave a short demonstration of speech output technology for the blind and made some comments about making accessible web sites.  The audience was a government office.  The overall point was that there are no generalizations worth stating. Some content is made accessible more easily than other content, and,  as you indicate, there are variables such as user agents and authoring tools.  However, it is really not very difficult to make most web sites/documents accessible. If someone asks me how to make a site accessible to blind persons, my first question is what assumptions are being made with regard to the following:   1) browser (and version)  2) adaptive technology   a. braille displays   b. screen review programs  3) Knowledge of the consumer (web page visitor)   a. Some screen review programs have advanced features which, if used, could be the difference between some specific presentation method (e.g. tables) being accessible or not.  Are you assuming the average visitor has the appropriate knowledge?   4) meaning of accessibility of your content   a. degree of ease of access to types of content    a.1 forms    a.2 tables    a.3 pictures, graphs, charts ...    Note that, in my view, discussion about access to content cannot begin until 1), 2), and 3) are answered.  The following questions are for clarification purposes only and are not criticisms of any kind.  It is important to keep the discussion positive while precisely describing the issues in a systematic, "top-down" manner, fleshing out the details as needed.  I am simply interested in the overall process involved.     Is HTML 4.0 compliance backward compatible?  That is, if I have an HTML 4.0 compliant site, is it accessible to blind persons using earlier versions of web browsers and screen review programs for example?  Are there any empirical data on just what browser/adaptive-technology combinations are being used?  If the answer to this latter question is "No", what assurance does a site/document designer have as to its accessibility?                                     ------  Steven McCaffrey  Information Technology Services  NYSED  (518)-473-3453      >>> "B.K. DeLong" <bkdelong@naw.org> 09/29 5:08 PM >>>  Very interesting sentiments, Kynn. I spent a good portion of last week  sitting at a booth at Web '98. I coordinated, planed, and managed an event  for Web Accessibility and the Web Standards Project. If I let myself be  discouraged, I could easily be because we didn't have nearly as many people  as I had hoped at either event.    But, I managed to have Web Standards Project brochures at every  non-profit's booth (ACM, WOW, AIP, WITI, CPSR, and Webgrrls) as well as a  huge stack of W3C sheets talking about the Web Accessibility Initiative and  their Page Authoring Guidelines. When I'd feel my audience slipping from  our organization, I would jump in really quick about the other two efforts.    Every time I saw someone from an educational institution, government  organization, or military installation, I mentioned the 1996 US DOJ ruling  about how Web sites of public libraries, colleges and universities, state,  federal, or local government organizations AND- this one got them- almost  everyone who has a government contract need to be compliant with Title II  and III of the ADA, EVERYONE was interested. I ran out of information  sheets and people requested I e-mail them the URL for the page authoring  guidelines.    Plus, I explained to all other Web developers that the Page Authoring  Guidelines really go over how to make your Web site more accessible without  having to completely sacrifice design...or maintain a completely seperate  text page. When Web developers hear accessibility, they think work. If you  think about it, it really isn't. If you're Web site is HTML 4.0  compliant....then you're most of the way there to being Accessible.    Also, I think we should follow the good ideas of the Web Standards Project.  They are going after the "user agent" and "authoring tool" manufacturers,  having them make it so Web sites are more accessible. If we convince the  Web developing public that this is a good cause, (as the WSP has convinced  them.....), then they will fully support Web accessibility.    It's just a matter of figuring out how to push people's buttons and how to  get them going. Don't get discouraged. If people like you who are working  so hard for the cause lose faith....then so will everyone else. Keep up the  excellent work.  --  B.K.

      Hello Tyler:    Good question.  The first thing is to ask what kind of information you are trying to convey through the chart.  What does a sighted person get by looking at the chart.  The next step is to figure out a linking mechanism that can most closely model eye-brain information retrieval operations (if I glance up I can find out who is at the top); if I glance to the right I find out...).  Be careful of two-dimensional trees.  This is my term for trees that have perhaps two kinds of hierarchical information (maybe "consists of" and "supervises".  Can you do this with just one list of links or do you really have, in effect, two trees?  (Of course, a tree diagram is 2d when drawn on paper or screen but I'm focusing on logical dimensionality rather than display dimensionality)  For a linking mechanism, I look for:  1. Consistent link text - if you link by office name, use this throughout and have the same information for each office in the same order.  2. A level by level traversal is best, (I like the model of a book: Chapter titles, Sections, subsections- if I click on Chapter 1, sections for chapter 1 only come up)  3. leaf node material should appear at the top of the page followed by nonleaf nodes( links to the next level.)  I'm not sure if this helps.  Some of this may be just my preference.      Steve  ITS  NYSED             

      Hello all:        Thanks, Marty, exactly the same sections I was going to excerpt.  I think the bottom line in all things accessible, is to try your best to limit accessibility barriers, follow the guidelines as strictly as you can, and, most importtantly, validate with real human users.  Automated tools and compliance claims are great, but what is the real impact of your design?  Just one small example.  Still my screen reader, now version 3.31 of JFW does not render the "Cups of Coffee..." table example as coded.  It is interesting to note that it says there that screen readers "might" render the table as indicated.  As far as I know, no existing screen reader does.  Would I prefer designers not to mark up tables as indicated there?  No, because I hope someday all screen readers will render properly marked up tables as indicated.  I guess this is more of a call to screen reader developers to improve there rendering of properly marked up tables.  Does anyone have a screen reader that renders the table as indicated?  Another minor aside, when I bring the Coffee table example into MS Word, it makes much more sense because it happens, thanks to HJ, they have included excellent table reading in Word tables.  So, even though IE 5.0/JFW 3.31 (not the latest version I know, but remember backwards compatibility) does not render tables the way I would like, I still would like designers to become familiar with proper structural markup, if only to become more clear about the difference between structure and presentation, which is, I would say, the main point for accessibility.   Although... one must be careful about this distinction.  For a non-reader (picking up on another thread), an icon or picture is not "presentation", but rather "content" since it "says" (i.e. conveys meaning) to the visitor.  One person's presentation is another's content?  The way around this possible dilemma is the "serves the same purpose" test coverred very well in the guidelines.  That's my 2 cents.  -Steve              Steve McCaffrey  Senior Programmer/Analyst  Information Technology Services  New York State Department of Education  (518)-473-3453  smccaffr@mail.nysed.gov  Member,  New York State Workgroup on Accessibility to Information Technology   Web Design Subcommittee   http://web.nysed.gov/cio/access/webdesignsubcommittee.html      >>> "Marti" <marti@agassa.com> 12/16/00 09:58AM >>>  Whew! Given the temperature of this rhetoric, it really could be a political  discussion.    While  (3.3)"Use style sheets to control layout and presentation" is certainly a  clear statement,  I can't help but wonder how you square it with  (11.1)"Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a  task and use the latest versions when supported."  Suppose, for a moment, that I was somehow able to create pages based purely  on CSS for layout and presentation such that they looked 'right' in the  latest versions of IE and NN.  Further, by some miracle they are ok without  CSS too!  Now, what am I supposed to do about all those 'partial'  implementations of CSS?  From the legal standpoint it appears,to me, that you could drive the  proverbial truck through the loophole(s) in 11.1.  Can any checkpoint be read as a stand alone element, or should they be  viewed in the larger context of the whole document?  Marti

      Hello Al:         Yes, I agree completely.  My screen reader and browser are fixed, so this is why I emphasized that I did not want to generalize.  For my versions of screen reader and browser, it appears the label in the example I gave works.  As for other screen readers I can't say.  Even for other codings of the form, I can't say.  I never know what is a safe  generalization.

      Hi Al:           I used the empty label tags   just to see if JFW was reading the for attribute text.         Thanks for the variation.  Interesting,  I hear "first name edit".  So, it seems to read only text between the label tags.  Would this be a safe conclusion?

It's not clear what the empty LABEL tag proves, but at least it acts as one  would expect.  And the negative result for the unmarked label wannabe text is  dead on.    There is another case you could try.

Some happen to have friends, teachers, rehab. professionals etc. who excel in all these areas and therefore can give maximum support.  I consider myself fortunate for the most part in this regard.  However, The system, on the whole, should not assume that every individual just happens to have all the necessary knowledge or all the best support.  This is simply not the case for a whole range of reasons, not the least of which is the complexity of this issue as evidenced by this very thread.  4) income level of particular individual.      To sum up my two cents on this thread thus far, I may be persuaded to change my mind about particular means by which we achieve this goal (e.g. standardize on a browser such as Lynx or a format such as HTML 4.0 or require plain text), but if the discussion of these means is before the above considerations, I believe we are putting theproverbial cart before the horse.                      ------  Steven McCaffrey  Information Technology Services  NYSED  (518)-473-3453      >>> Jason White <jasonw@ariel.ucs.unimelb.EDU.AU> 12/07 5:39 PM >>>  The solution is to provide a well marked up document which preserves all  of the semantic distinctions and structural aspects necessary to enable  conversion into a variety of formats, across a range of output devices.

           Is it a matter of choice w.r.t government agencies or does the law require their sites to be accessible?  Or does the law only require information on a site to be made available by some other means (e.g here is a phone number to call to get the information sent to you in an accessible format if  our site (or part of it) is not accessible to you).  I have read a few online  articles on this topic and am still not clear.

      Hi Kynn and all:         There are many important issues raised here, all of which deserve further exploration.  I too would be interested in some forum to do this.  I'm not sure I have a clear formulation in my own mind of the questions.  The goal is increased accessibility.  People have different motivations for their actions.  Also, of course, one person may have multiple motivations.    We want to make it possible for all people with their differing motivations to help increase accessibility.  In other words, it's like web accessibility itself!  For those who need a profit motive, we need to find ways  for people to profit by their knowledge or services involving accessibility.   For those motivated by other reasons (generate list of reasons),   we need to find ways to encourage  them to devote the time and effort to accessibility.  For those who would like recognition for their time and effort, maybe some more awards for accessibility can be created.    Certainly, all of these can be done and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.    Thanks for raising these very interesting, important, and complex issues.

Thinking on the matter further, though, has got me thinking about  the commercialization of web accessibility -- about increasing moves  away from simple grass-roots help and toward the idea of web  accessibilty as a business model.    Much of the newfound profitability of web accessibility stems  directly from the U.S. government's Section 508 requirements for  accessibility -- a legislative remedy that I've both praised as  excellent in theory and criticized as poor in implementation.  One major effect of 508 has been to carve out new niche markets  which didn't exist before, in terms of services and support for  accesible web design.    The effects of this are debatable -- there have been a number of  moves by for-profit and non-profit groups alike to "cash in" on  these new market niches.  This may not be a bad thing, as for years  web accessibility was _not_ a hot, "sexy" item and a number of  people and companies, myself included, have not made nearly the  money that would normally be coming to us if we'd give up this  accessibility cause and spend our time in the pursuit of  profit.    On the other hand, there's questions as to the changing nature of  the field and whether or not that will have positive implications  on the end users of the Internet who may have disabilities.    Here's some of the things I'm thinking about today:    * CAST's Bobby program is no longer free.  The web version has     no charge associated with it, but the downloadable, locally     run program (for checking mass numbers of pages, pages behind     a firewall, or those which aren't live yet) is now $99.  (Or     far more for a site license.)    * The Brainbench test on accessibility is no longer free either;     it's now $20 or so, if you want to test your knowledge of     web accessibility and certify it with an online test.    * My own web accessibility online course -- running since 1998 --     has been joined by a number of other online courses.  WebAIM,     EASI, WOW.  All of these have a higher price point than my     seven-week course by about a factor of 3 to 10; perhaps I need     to up rates to stay competitive.    * Macromedia has recently put out a nice package of materials     on accessibility -- but to get it, apparently you need to     buy a Macromedia product.    * Jakob Nielsen's done an accessibility and usability study;     you can buy it for about $200 in PDF format.  The WAI idea of     cooperative, consensus-based creation of accessibility     guidelines doesn't seem to be particularly proftiable.    * Books are in production on web accessibility, including books     written by members of the W3C's working group.  Joe Clark     is the most obvious example; his blog has mentioned great     advances in figuring out how to make web sites accessible.     But you won't read about them in WCAG 2.0 -- you'll need to     buy Joe's book.    * A number of new companies -- or perhaps old companies with new     marketing budgets -- have sprung up to offer accessibility     consulting and evaluation services at prices of dozens of     thousands of dollars or more.    Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not stating the above as items which  should (or should not) be criticized.  I'm looking at them as part  of a bigger picture, and I'm asking the question of whether or not  this will have a net positive effect.    Many of the things listed are indicative of a greater awareness  of web accessibility, and that's something I and others have been  working on for a long time.  The increase in the number of  training options, the corporate attention to the issue, the  involvement of a major usability "celebrity" in championing  accessibility, the greater willingness of publishers to take  a chance on an accessibility book -- these are all welcome  changes for the better.    But other things need to be considered as well, such as the  continuing role of the W3C in these events, the possibility of  "profiteering" (if that's even a bad thing), the increasing  expense to the independent web designer, and so on.  I'm not  sure if these questions are currently being raised, and I'm  not entirely sure which forum is appropriate for raising them  (and thus the fact that you may see this posted several  places).    Will we see, for example, a "proprietization" of web accessibility  techniques?  Will Macromedia or Kynn Bartlett or Joe Clark or  anyone else decide that it's not worth their time to work on  consensus-based projects but instead to create copyrighted materials?  Will instructors of online classes realize that they can make more  money doing consulting instead of training other consultants who  then get the lucrative gigs?  Will A-Prompt or the W3C Validator  become victims of their own success and decide to start charging  since Bobby did?    I don't think people are getting rich in droves off this, by  the way.  I don't imagine CAST bigwigs sitting back cackling  with glee, or Joe Clark buying a huge mansion with the advances  on his hard work.  And I wouldn't even object if it were  happening -- partly because I think there are a number of people  who have done great work who have been financially UNrewarded for  their efforts, and partially out of pure self-interest greed.  Hey, I'd love for my chosen field of interest to suddenly become  the path to financial freedom!    A better explanation is that this is "web accessibility growing up",  at least a little bit.  Of new forces that weren't at work several  years ago now coming to the fore, and with those, we need to look  at existing processes and see how they're being changed.  It's  time to discuss the role of the W3C in the future of web  accessibility.  It's time to discuss the corporate and  government interests.  It's time to re-evaluate what we're doing  and where things are going, and for it's time for some of us to  make clearer plans and provide vision.    This rambled on a bit more than I thought it would.  While some of  it may be generated by my ongoing state of unemployment (and thus  opportunity and motive to consider the larger picture), I believe  these are topics that would be good for discussion among people  who share the same goal of improving accessibility of the web  for everyone.

      Hello WCAG 2.0 draft  editors and contributors:         Thank you for soliciting comments on a very early draft of WCAG 2.0.  Doing this has some advantages and some disadvantages ,  as Judy indicates below.  I have commented inline below.    Message-Id: <3.0.5.32.20010125171245.00979460@localhost>    Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2001 17:12:45 -0500    w3c-wai-ig@w3.org>    From: Judy Brewer <  jbrewer@w3.org>    Subject: Please review: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0   Working Draft        WAI Interest Group Members,        The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) of W3C's    Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) published the first public Working Draft    of WCAG 2.0 on 25 January 2001 [1]. This Working Draft shows how more    generalized (less HTML-specific) WCAG checkpoints might read. This draft is    not based on consensus of the WCAG Working Group, nor has it gone through    W3C process. Checkpoints in this Working Draft in no way supersede the    checkpoints in WCAG 1.0.         This is a preliminary document, not stable or referenceable yet, with much    work still to be done. If you are interested in comparing checkpoints in    WCAG 1.0 with evolving checkpoints in the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft, please    refer to the Checkpoint Mapping [2]. Feedback will be welcome throughout    the course of document development, but feedback in the early stages of    document development is especially useful.        At this stage we invite comments on two mailing lists:     - For any comments that you want to be sure are registered with the WCAG    Working Group regarding the January 25th WCAG 2.0 Working Draft, please    send them to  w3c-wai-gl@w3.org  by Thursday, 22 February, 2001.    - For general discussion about this Working Draft, please comment on    w3c-wai-ig@w3.org. That discussion will be monitored to some extent by the    WCAG Working Group, but it does not guarantee that every issue raised there    will be registered with the Working Group for formal discussion.        The WCAG Working Group welcomes comment on any aspect of the draft, but is    particularly interested in feedback on the following issues:        1. Are the checkpoints and guidelines in the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft easier    to understand than in WCAG 1.0?  Has terminology been used that is hard to    understand?  We realize that filling in the Glossary will help with some of    these issues. Are there terms that are not listed in the Glossary that    should be?    Steve:   a.  easier to understand:  It depends what this phrase means.  I may "understand" something  without being able to perform a task because the term is not on a low enough level to be executed.  What background knowledge is assumed?   b. filling in the Glossary ...:  Yes, it is not possible to give very specific comments without the definitions.  if the definitions are critical to understanding the content.  c. terms that are not listed...: Yes, accessible.  In WCAG 1.0 the definition was  "          Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a            disability.", which, logically, by the use of "someone" could be interpreted to mean  "at least one".  This is not the intent.  Rather it should read: Content is accessible if it may be used by a wide range of people with various characteristics, technologies, and environments" or something like this.  Some on the WAI IG list still seem to believe that if just some people can, potentially (if only they had browser x and screen reader y ...), access the page, then it is accessible.  This is of course not the case.      2. This initial public WCAG 2.0 Working Draft does not have as much    explanation for each guideline as WCAG 1.0. This is partially because the    WCAG Working Group has discussed a three-layered approach, with the first    layer being more explanatory (what are the basic ideas about Web content    accessibility, how can this document be referenced, etc.), the second layer    being the guidelines and checkpoints explaining how to make a Web site    accessible, and the third being techniques, tests, and/or examples that    would help explain how to implement this in different Web technologies.    What do people think about this approach? It might be hard to imagine since    the current Working Draft only includes the second layer, but we would    appreciate your thoughts on this.    Steve:  A three layerred approach is a good idea.  However this means the linking to the next layer is even more important.  The more abstract layer X is, the more guidance is needed to select that specific portion of the next layer that is needed to implement the guideline.  It could be the case though that the generalized guidelines are so abstract, it is not clear to the reader which link to choose.  In other words, paradoxically, he will have to read all of layer 3 in order to figure out which link in layer 2 to select.  Technically speaking, I would not describe the guidelines as "how" instructions but rather "what" instructions.  The techniques are how items.  This distinction is critical because the task of a document like this is to carefully and unambiguously provide the reader with a path from high level what items to the corresponding how items.  One person's what is another person's how.  The difference is background knowledge.  I don't know what background is assumed.  There were many discussions on WAI IG about exactly how conversant with HTML a developer needs to be.              3. There are only 22 Checkpoints in the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft versus over    60 in WCAG 1.0. Have we generalized things too much, or does it make it    easier to grasp the concepts?    Steve: Again this depends on assumed background knowledge.  Almost by definition a generalization of a specific instance cannot be understood without knowledge of that specific instance.  Generalizations can help traverse a tree of knowledge from root to leaves or  to build a tree from leaves to root.  If "to generalize" means "to group together, to bring under one category", then I must already have knowledge of the individual instances.  However, if you are teaching something, you might start at the highestt level and then give specific examples later.  This means though that real understanding is deferred until all the examples are internalized.  If the highest levels are clear enough, it will be possible for the reader to generate her own examples.  Generalization can provide a framework in which to place a range of specific instances at a later date.  Which kind of generalization is intended?  In other words, are you trying to get the reader to create the tree or to traverse an existing one?  If you want the tree to be traversed, then it must be clear to the reader at each level, using knowledge at that level only,  which child node is appropriate.  Do I go to the HTML, XML, SVG, etc techniques document?  If I don't even know what these languages are and have never seen examples of these how will I know  which link to choose?  What level of knowledge is assumed?  Mathematics is often used as an example of a prerequisite intensive subject meaning knowledge of the subject must be "built up" on analogy with the construction of a house.  One cannot understand Calculus without having a thorough knowledge  of Algebra, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry.  Algebra in turn cannot be understood without a thorough knowledge of Arithmetic.  However, recently, in some educational circles it is thought that teaching the "concepts" of Calculus can be taught perhaps as early as say fifth grade, that is, without the prerequisite knowledge of Algebra etc.  Well, sure, the "concept" of rates of change, slope etc. can be understood but this does not mean a fifth grader  could actually  calculate a derivative.  So, it depends on what you want your students (readers) to be able to do.  You have to break it down to very small pieces:  I want my students (readers) to be able to do: <list>"    "I am assuming my student (reader) already can do the followoing:<list>"                 4. Note that there are many open issues [3] that the WCAG Working Group    needs to discuss, and that this is just the first of many Working Drafts.        5. Other suggestions or comments are welcome.        This message may be circulated to other lists, but please be careful to    avoid cross-postings.

      Hello Charles:         Good question.  I don't want to generalize, so let me just give an example that does work.  The example in section 11.2 of the   HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 works fine.  I hear  "First name colon edit"  then I hit tab and hear:  "Last name colon edit"  which is fine.  The snipet for the first name is:       <LABEL for="firstname">First name: </LABEL>     <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">    Note my comments above are not about grouping form controls which is the main point of 11.2.

      Hi Jim etal:         Could you clarify with the snipet below?     <LABEL for="firstname">First name: </LABEL>       <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">    What do you vary and what do you hold constant?    1. Keep the text between the label tags, drop the label tags   First name:       <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">    or    2. Keep the label tags and drop the text between tags.     <LABEL for="firstname"></LABEL>       <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">    If I use 1 above and use the tab key, JFW 3.31   skips over the First name: text   which is still there and just says "Edit"   so it is looking for some tag at least, although another tag besides the label tag might work.  Adjacency has no effect.  That is, I tried  First name: <INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1">  JFW 3.31 still skipped over the First name: text.    If I use 2 above, again I just hear "Edit"  Now, at this point, I'm not considering complicating factors like tables etc.  I want to vary one component at a time to determine what causes what.    Am I varying factors incorrectly?    Steve    >>> thatch@attglobal.net 05/31/01 05:13PM >>>  Hi all,    The label (first name) works because it is adjacent to the text input field,  not because of the LABEL element. Screen readers have been picking up  prompts like this since they were born. Label-for is only interesting when  the actual text of the prompt is some distance from the INPUT element. That  happens, for example, in a table of INPUT elements, and then LABEL-for is  inadequate!    I know this has gotten far off the track of the original question but I  could no longer resist.    BTW, GWMicro uses Frames correctly. They are well "named" for both screen  readers and Lynx. If I were them, I would not have used the NOFRAME content,  but so be it.

My screen reader and browser are fixed, so  this is why I emphasized that I did not want to generalize.  For my versions  of screen reader and browser, it appears the label in the example I gave  works.  As for other screen readers I can't say.  Even for other codings of the form, I can't say.  I never know what is a  safe  generalization.      An examnple that doesn't work for me  is on the wired article page from a previous message  (JFW 3.31 IE 5.0)    http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,44062,00.html>  I hear (skipping some links)  "Slash news slash image map link" then I tab and hear  "Edit"  then I tab and hear  "Combo box"  then I tab and hear  "Go button"    If I hit enter on the Combo box to go into forms mode,  then I hear  "Look for combo box Wired news"  (a pull down list)    I think the "Look for" is supposed to be associated with the edit field and  not the Combo box, right?  This had me confused for some time.  I'll try to find an example of what works.

It would help to have  examples of  what works and also of what doesn't work.  You and David seem to believe  that  we still need explanatory text, or at least some text, in the edit boxes for  best practice at the moment.  This is an "until user agents" provision in  the  WCAG.  So for objectivity and consensus, it helps to know what the actual  user  agents do with actual pages.    To sell this to web authors as the general rule of what to do, it helps to  have  chapter and verse documentation explaining in what situations alternatives  don't work.  Target page, OS, Browser, Screen reader with versions.  It  helps.    Al    At 11:15 AM 2001-05-31 -0400, you wrote:  >Hello Charles:  >  >     Good question.

      Hello Sime and all:         Although the conversion link is a step in the right direction, post conversion assessment for accessibility is essential.  Instructions are easier to convert than the forms.  Try f1040.pdf  to see what I mean.  I found the resulting conversion completely incomprehensible.        Can anyone clarify Sec 508 paragraph M of 1194.22 on this?  Is it sufficient to provide a link to a plug-in or conversion link or is an alternative accessible version on the site required?  I would hope it is the latter.    Steve    Steve McCaffrey  ITS  NYSED             

       There is a description of text (and non-text) equivalents with examples in the WCAG glossary under "equivalent" and my screen reader at least tells me there is a "definition of text equivalent"  at  http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#text-equivalent  -Steve        Steve McCaffrey  Senior Programmer/Analyst  Information Technology Services  New York State Department of Education  (518)-473-3453  smccaffr@mail.nysed.gov  Member,  New York State Workgroup on Accessibility to Information Technology   Web Design Subcommittee   http://web.nysed.gov/cio/access/webdesignsubcommittee.html      >>> "Bailey, Bruce" <Bruce_Bailey@ed.gov> 12/11/00 08:55AM >>>  Dear Alice,    Your message prompted me to notice that the WCAG glossary does not define  either "auditory description" nor "textual equivalents".  Clearly this is an  oversight.    Textual equivalent (in the context of this discussion) means the transcript  of an audio (or video) presentation.  In many cases, especially dramatic  presentations, textual equivalence is more than just the words which are  spoken, and does need to be fairly descriptive.  The term "audio  description" is something quite different, has nothing to do with text, and  has a specific meaning.    Audio description is a technique of incorporating additional spoken  narrative on a movie's sound track.  By definition then, audio description  IS in time with the presentation, so keeping it synchronized is NOT an  issue.  For a web example, you might take a look at URL:  <http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/access/dvs/dvsclip.html> (which also includes the  textual equivalent).    Checkpoint 1.3 reads as it does because there is still no technology would  allow text (in any form) to be exposed to a screen reader in time with a  multimedia presentation.  Since there is not a way for an end user to create  dynamic audio description (using speech synthesis and a textual equivalent),  1.3 is basically a requirement for content providers to offer a sound track  incorporating audio description whenever they post multimedia.    Checkpoint 1.4 refers really just to captioning -- since audio description  is synced.  (Although, I guess, it would be theoretically possible NOT to be  synchronized -- but that would be MORE work!  There are plenty of examples  of bad or poorly done audio description.  But, just as there are plenty of  example of badly done web pages, that is not a WCAG checkpoint violation!)

      Oops, I meant to send my comments regarding  equations to all of WAI IG and just realized I only sent them to Dave.    Here is what I sent.      Yes, I agree.  MATHML is not yet supported by screen readers.    Personally, I prefer simple ASCII (or even LaTex source) representations because there is less chance of ambiguity than there might be with words.    If ASCII is used, be careful of multiline fractions where dashes are used to represent the line separating numerator from denominator.  Since a screen reader reads one line at a time, the user will hear just the numerators then the next line the user will hear something like dash dash dash then the next line will be the sequence of denominators.  As you might imagine, this is very confusing.  It's better to do something like  [(x+2)/3] + [(x+4)/5] = 8.       I have come across many sites that seem to be using ASCII but for some reason the exponent comes out on the base line.  Many sites have Einstein's famous equation expressing the equivalence of mass and energy as (what sounds like)  e = mc2.  Since I know what the equation is supposed to be, using the up arrow for exponentiation, it should be  e = mc^2, (happily, some sites have this representation).  Does anyone know why, on some sites, the exponent comes out on the baseline?      Steve  ITS  NYSED  >>> <D.W.Russo@sas.com> 07/30/01 06:34AM >>>    I am not an expert, but I have been researching this issue a bit.     For an overview of ways to make equations accessible, see these guidelines from the CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media:     http://ncam.wgbh.org/cdrom/guideline/6.html     In regard to MathML, today's browsers and accessibility software do not seem to provide significant MathML support. See the thread in this list: "MathML and screen readers"     My general impression is that if your documents contain relatively few, simple equations, you might be able to do something that will give at least some visually-impaired people access to your equations. If you have a large library of documents with complex equations, the challenge is much greater.     Dave     Steve         

      Hi Liz:         If your curious, here is how one version of one screen reader rendered what you have so far:  (Jaws For Windows ver 3.31 with IE 5)    Property Description    Address:  2356 South George Street apt 6  Property ID#:  4    Type:  Duplex  Bedrooms:  5    Level:  GroundLevel  Max Occupancy:  8    Immediate Possession:  [Property is currently unoccupied]  Yes.  Wheelchair Accessible:  No.    General Location:  Central: 13th to 18th (east of High st.)     The only minor difficulty is to figure out which comes under property and which under description but I think all the important information is clear.    Steve  Information Technology Services  NYSED  smccaffr@mail.nysed.gov     >>> Liz Roberts <liz@netlogix.net> 05/11/01 01:08PM >>>  Everyone's comments have been incredibly helpful; of course, I always seem  to have more questions!    In regards to the data vs. layout table issue, I would like to present the  following example:    <http://www.geocities.com/lizdesign/tables.html>    Supposing this is a data table, the top-level "header" is "Property  Description," with "Name," "address," and the like a "second level" of  headers (labeled as TDs because: "TH is for headers, TD for data, but for  cells acting as both use TD"  <http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.6>).  Of course, the  spec doesn't show an example of such a construct... should you use "id" and  "headers" with TDs?  ("headers" are not included in example because I wasn't  sure.)    I feel like I'm using a table for layout... but if I think about the data  logically, it seems like there are logical headers, etc.    And on the page before my example one, there are search results that I don't  feel use the table simply for layout.    Thanks again,  Liz        

      Hi Robert:         I have not seen this before. I know he made this proposal during the campaign but have not seen anything since.  Do you know if it will be placed on the whitehouse web site?  I searched for it this morning and could not find any information at all.  I hope this will pass congress.  It looks very good and was more than I had hoped for.    -Steve          Steve McCaffrey  Senior Programmer/Analyst  Information Technology Services  New York State Department of Education  (518)-473-3453  smccaffr@mail.nysed.gov  Member,  New York State Workgroup on Accessibility to Information Technology   Web Design Subcommittee   http://web.nysed.gov/cio/access/webdesignsubcommittee.html

      Miscellaneous:    1. Does anyone know if aural style sheets are supported by screen readers?  As far as I know, they are not.  2. I think Lynx displays the source XML file.  If the elements (tags) are indeed semantic and not like <red>, <flashing>, then the source file itself might be the best way to go.    3. IE seems to use some default display.  Can I get IE 5 to display a source XML file that does not have an associated CSS or XSlL file as a plain text file?    I think that draft is a very good start.    Steve
