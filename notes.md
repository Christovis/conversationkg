# Notes

A place for shared notes and pointers

- Work of [Svitlana Vakulenko](https://svakulenk0.github.io/) is interesting. 
    - Her phd on knowledge based conversational search is good. 
    - Start with the [slides](https://svakulenk0.github.io/pdfs/slides/defence_final.pdf)
- [An introduction to dialog research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1arMKZks0_IEqdsvJrPrhqa_9yEdq57CCY_Dm9wlETrM/mobilepresent?slide=id.g2a1dee6562_0_221)


## New tasks

- More data:
    - larger, higher quality, more extensive coverage of domains
    - e.g. (1) scrape more of the W3C mailing lists, (2) Spotify Podcast Dataset, (3) revisit other data sets?
    
- Situating the conversations in larger context:
    - Connecting to KB such as Wikidata, linking and resolving entities
    - Using ML methods on the data, e.g. topic modelling or open IE <br>
       => perhaps embedding-based with BERT
    - 
- Conversation-based KG: 
    - (More detailed) indexing of mentions of entities and concepts in dialogues (-> cf. tracking)
    - Comparing/Contrasting/Merging (novel) conversation-based KG to/with other/existing KGs <br>
       -> e.g. dialogue-typical distributions and their implications
    - Work more towards conversation-based data structure
