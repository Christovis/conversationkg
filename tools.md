# Papers and tools for KGE and OpenIE


 ## Processed Datasets:
 
   - OPIEC: OpenIE done on entire English Wikipedia with additional annotations <br>
     (_Gashteovski et al.: OPIEC: An Open Information Extraction Corpus_)

   - X-WikiRE: OpenIE done cross-linguistically on Wikipedia of 5 European languages <br>
     (_Abdou et al.: X-WikiRE: A Large, Multilingual Resource for Relation Extraction as Machine Comprehension_) <br>
     -> in addition to providing annotated multilingual data, paper shows that cross-lingual transfer leads to more robust extraction models


 ## KGE, i.e. entity set and relation set given and task is essentially classification:
   
   - SpERT: joint entity and relation extraction based on BERT embeddings <br>
     (_Eberts & Ulges: Span-based Joint Entity and Relation Extraction with Transformer Pre-training_) <br>
     -> similar: _Dixit & Al-Onaizan Span-Level Model for Relation Extraction_
     
   - Comet: Transformer-LM-based approach to KB completion in natural language phrases<br>
     (_Bosselut at al.: COMET: Commonsense Transformers for Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction_)
   
 ## OpenIE, i.e. discovery rather than extraction of entities and relations:
 
   - Summary: Map existing OpenIE studies according to formally defined criteria to identify trends and issues
     (_Glauber & Claro: A systematic mapping study on open information extraction_)
     
   - Summary: Broad overview over exisiting OpenIE approaches, models and tools, including review of performance and open problems <br>
     (_Niklaus et al.: A Survey on Open Information Extraction_)
    
   - MinIE: model and tool for OpenIE, reportedly more robust to polarity and modality of facts <br>
     (_Gashteovski et al.: MinIE: Minimizing Facts in Open Information Extraction_)
   
   - CORE: OpenIE model which integrates contextual information to increase accuracy <br>
     (_Petroni et al.: CORE: Context-Aware Open Relation Extraction with Factorization Machines_) <br>
     -> related: _Sorokin & Gurevych: Context-Aware Representations for Knowledge Base Relation Extraction_
