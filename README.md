Guide to directories (See READMEs in each for more information)

* [w3c_emails](https://github.com/pgroth/conversationkg/blob/master/w3c_emails) - building an knowledge graph from a W3C mailing lists already crawled. Becoming obsolete, with scrape_W3C and conversation_building implementing the same tasks, where corpus processing and graph construction are separate.
* [embeddings_for_the_people](https://github.com/pgroth/conversationkg/blob/master/embeddings_for_the_people) - entity resolution as authorship attributioon.
* [scrape_W3C](https://github.com/pgroth/conversationkg/blob/master/scrape_W3C) - scraping the W3C email lists ourselves to make a bigger and cleaner corpus.
* [conversation_building](https://github.com/pgroth/conversationkg/blob/master/conversation_building) - using the scraped W3C email lists to build conversation-based knowledge graphs as a test bed for analytics.
* [analytics](https://github.com/pgroth/conversationkg/blob/master/analytics) - first ideas and plans for, then implementations of analyses of how conversation-based KGs, and ML algorithms trained on them, perform in terms of usability, efficacy and helpfulness to human analysts
